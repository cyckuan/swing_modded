<P>
   FORT BENNING, Ga. _ In a small classroom inside a pink building
on this historic Army post, Maj. Pablo Friedrich is learning the
art of war.
</P>
<P>
   A bearish marine from Colombia, he will spend nine weeks here
studying tactical manuals translated into Spanish from the books
used by American officers. Then he will return home as deputy
commander of a marine battalion in Cartagena, rejoining Colombia's
civil war against guerrillas and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he returns as a more professional soldier infused with
American military values or as one trained to wage a more efficient
war of repression is the question at the heart of a roiling
national debate over this training center, the Army's School of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, thousands of protesters led by a Roman
Catholic priest gathered at Fort Benning's main gate just outside
Columbus for the annual protest to demand the closing of the
school, the nation's main training center for Latin American
military and police officers for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a funereal procession of 3,100 protesters marched onto
the post, led by several dozen dressed in black robes and white
masks and carrying wooden coffins they said represented those
killed by graduates of the school. In a peaceful, carefully
choreographed confrontation, the Army stopped them after nearly a
mile, put them on buses and drove them off the post. Sixty-five
protesters were detained and given citations barring them from Fort
Benning for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't teach democracy anywhere by training the military,''
said Joe Morton, a white-haired 63-year-old professor at Goucher
College in Baltimore, moments before he boarded a bus at the post.
``Students who come here are going to go back to their countries
and shoot people like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera announced plans
to make significant changes to the school's curriculum in hopes of
muting growing opposition, especially in Congress, which nearly
voted to close the school this fall. If the protests were an
indication, though, the plans failed to win over the most fervent
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to transform this school,'' the Rev. Roy L.
Bourgeois, the priest who has organized the opposition, told the
protesters on Saturday. ``We are here _ and we need to make this
clear _ to close this school.''
</P>
<P>
   But a visit to the school and the protests suggests that this
has become a debate about how the United States will work with
Central and South American militaries after the tumultuous,
sometimes violent engagement of the past, when Washington
overlooked abuses in the name of fighting leftist insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has become an abstraction to the people out
there,'' the school's commandant, Col. Glenn R. Weidner, said on
Friday, as the first protesters assembled at Fort Benning's main
gate.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera and other officials have strongly defended the school
and its mission, which they say is to promote modern, professional
militaries that respect democracy and human rights. Caldera said
the changes would enhance that, training Latin American officers to
cope with today's problems, from drug trafficking to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are legitimate security interests that they have,''
Caldera said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the school's critics are ``willfully ignorant,''
slurring the reputation of the Army with accusations that the
school has encouraged violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't teach American soldiers to violate human rights,''
Caldera said, ``and we don't teach soldiers of any foreign
countries to violate human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has become so polarizing, the oratory so extreme,
that it overshadows the teaching that actually goes on inside the
school, located in the old headquarters of the Army's Infantry
School, an elegant three-story building on manicured grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Panama in 1946 and relocated here in 1984, the school
still offers purely military courses in skills like basic combat
and flying helicopters. But since the end of the Cold War, its
focus has shifted. Its catalog now includes courses on computers,
medical care and more mundane matters of organizing a professional
military. Students today spend more time in the classroom than on
Fort Benning's firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich, whose father was a German U-boat sailor who
immigrated to Colombia after World War II, arrived with four
captains from his country and another from Mexico for a course on
how to plan a defense against a hypothetical invasion. Consulting
Army manuals and scrawling with markers on maps and charts tacked
to the wall, they plotted each step of the ``battle'' with
occasional nudging from their Army instructor, Maj. Jaime F.
Llinet.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich said the course was valuable, exposing him to the
latest in American war tactics. ``We believe it is the most
advanced doctrine in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its history, the school has trained 61,000 students from 23
countries. Today, only students from Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti are
ineligible. The State Department pays students' expenses and
screens applicants for accusations of abuses. The school trains
about 800 students a year in courses that last from two weeks to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   In noncombat classes, as many as a third of the students are
civilians, like Maria Gonzalez Vila, a lawyer with Uruguay's
Ministry of Defense. She just completed a five-week course called
Resource Management. Under Caldera's plan, the school would
increase slots for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Army has also added training on human
rights. The busiest lecturer on the staff of 288 is the
soft-spoken, erudite Army lawyer who teaches international
humanitarian law, Maj. Antonio Raimondo.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who come for as little as two weeks receive eight
hours of lessons on human rights. The officers who attend the
yearlong ``Command and General Staff Course'' sit through 40 hours.
There is also an annual ``Human Rights Week,'' which in February
will include a case study of the American massacre at My Lai during
the Vietnam War and a tour of Andersonville, the notorious
Confederate prison camp, whose commander was the only officer
hanged for war crimes after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Weidner said the graduates who went on to commit abuses were the
exceptions. By the opponents' own count, he said, only 300 to 500
of the school's 61,000 students have been linked to atrocities, in
some cases years after they attended short courses. Those few, he
added, are the ones who did not learn the lessons taught here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel betrayed by them,'' Weidner said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics view the emphasis on human rights _ like the proposed
changes _ as an obfuscation. The school's core is and will be
military training, they say, perpetuating the militaries'
disproportionate role in Central and South American democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the reform line before,'' said Heather A. Dean, a
protest organizer. ``And while they have made some reforms, the
bread and butter is still combat training.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The protests at Fort Benning began 10 years ago with only a
handful of opponents, led by Bourgeois, a Navy veteran who has been
deeply involved in Latin American causes since serving as a
missionary in Bolivia in the 1970s. Since then the protests have
grown, even as the crimes committed by the school's graduates
recede into the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for them to say when it is time to forgive,''
Bourgeois said of the Army's insistence that the school has moved
on from its Cold War role.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 people attended the November protest.
This year, the Columbus police estimated that there were 8,000, the
largest gathering of people in the city since it played host to
women's softball in the 1996 Olympics. The protest has become such
an event that the city's tourism bureau this year helped arrange
hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   To the school's instructors, the placards depicting blood and
graves and invariably referring to the ``School of the Assassins''
have become uncomfortably personal attacks. Several singled out
remarks by a leading congressional critic, Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., who last week dismissed the planned changes as ``putting
perfume on a toxic dump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a trash dump, then I'm the trash,'' said Llinet,
the instructor. A 19-year veteran, he pointed defiantly,
defensively to a patch on his shoulder that he earned for serving
in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an assassin,'' he added. ``I'm a good old Army guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Llinet, who served as a military trainer in Venezuela, said he
agreed with some of the protesters' underlying concerns. He spoke
of ``social injustice'' in Latin America, particularly the economic
disparities that leave the poor mired in hardship and the elite,
often including the militaries, in control.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the school's training served a valuable purpose by
promoting regional stability, encouraging democracy and minimizing
the possibility of American military intervention, the very thing
the protesters oppose most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we don't have to send American forces to Latin America
because of the students who came here,'' he said. ``If we close the
school, maybe we're going to have to go back to the interventionist
policies of Teddy Roosevelt, because when there is a security
threat in Latin America, you know we're going to be there.''

A BUSY CLINTON MAKES TIME FOR PALACE-GAZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE _ Russia is bombing Chechnya, the Greeks and the Turks
are feuding, demonstrators in Athens are smashing windows, and
there's the challenge of wiring Africa to the Internet to address.
Who has time to sightsee?
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, President Clinton did this past week. Despite an
action-packed schedule of meetings, conciliations, attempted
mediations, and state dinners, Clinton went into Uber-tourist mode,
managing to squeeze in visits to some of the world's most
extraordinary historical sights.
</P>
<P>
   It was classic Clinton _ constantly on the move, switching
quickly from touring an archeological site to scolding Boris
Yeltsin, then back to palace-gazing and a boat ride before popping
back to sign an international security charter.
</P>
<P>
   The president seems rarely to sleep, scheduling an event or
address into nearly every waking moment. This is, after all, a
leader who took a day trip to Bosnia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't a surprise to Clinton's entourage that the
president _ while cramming foreign policy events in seven cities in
five countries into the space of 10 days _ was determined to play
tourist as well as president.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pounding rain that has fallen nearly every day on the
Clinton tour has not discouraged the president from visiting major
art and archeological attractions.
</P>
<P>
   But then, when you're the First Tourist, sightseeing is a little
easier _ at least for the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   He awoke early Sunday in a walking mood, squeezing in a stroll
along the Arno before heading to a conference to discuss such
issues as the future of the welfare state, and how to wire the
world to the Internet. He was trailed, as usual, by a string of
reporters, cameramen, secret service agents, and staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the president visited the ancient Turkish city of Ephesus
last week, he flew Air Force One to Izmit, then was squired in a
42-car motorcade to the excavated site. And there was no need to
worry about lines because the place was closed for his visit.
</P>
<P>
   In Istanbul, Clinton took a private tour of the 16th-century
Topkapi Palace. Less than an hour after being in his presidential
role, signing an international security agreement, Clinton switched
into history-professor mode at the palace, enthusiastically
explaining to a reporter how one of the Sultans brought Delft tiles
from Holland to mix in with the Turkish tiles on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton managed to get in a boat ride, albeit hardly a leisurely
one. The First Family took a 35-minute cruise on the Bosporus,
followed, naturally, by yet another luxury boat for the press corps
and a flotilla of police boats. Some secret service agents were in
wetsuits, just in case the president fell into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Athens, where demonstrators set fires and smashed
storefronts to protest Clinton's visit, the president took an
unplanned excursion to the Acropolis. Usually, such an unscheduled
trip would be a security nightmare for a host city, but because
that part of Athens was closed to traffic and loaded with police,
the visit wasn't much extra effort for Greece, said Rachel Howard,
a spokeswoman for the Greek Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But ``imagine,'' she said, ``what it would have been like if
he'd stayed three days'' as originally planned.

PRESSURE IS OFF FOR TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC gets to start the 2000s with a clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any team in the 1990s, next year's Trojans will not enter
the season with a major losing streak to an archrival gnawing at
its psyche. Thanks to Saturday's 17-7 victory over UCLA, the
Trojans have eradicated the endless debate about whether it would
ever end the Bruins' winning streak, which had stretched to eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a dollar for every time somebody came up to me and
said, `Just beat UCLA,' I'd be a rich man,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``No matter what else we did all year, I kept hearing, `Find
a way to get me out of my misery' about this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett accomplished that mission and also took a major amount
of heat off himself. A victory over the Bruins is like a
``get-out-of-jail-free card.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, a lot of USC fans are probably happier today with
a 5-6 record and victory over UCLA than they would be with an 8-3
record and a loss to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad we got it for coach Hackett,'' tailback Chad
Morton said. ``It's a shame he took so much bad press this year
when it was our fault. We screwed up our season, not him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the magnitude a losing streak can have when it builds and
builds. The Trojans had a similar experience with Notre Dame after
going winless for 13 seasons before beating the Irish in 1996, a
victory that basically gave then-coach John Robinson an extra
season.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration over losing year after year to UCLA was just as
intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much animosity built over eight years,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why so few people will focus on the poor records of both
teams, or the fact that it was one of the sloppier games of the
rivalry. Or that the Trojans committed 16 penalties, including an
astounding 11 by the offensive linemen, if you count left guard
Faasea Mailo's personal foul when he played fullback.
</P>
<P>
   None of that matters after USC defeats an arch-rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely inexplicable. I can't explain it. It's a joy I
haven't seen around here in a long time,'' cornerback Kris Richard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was willing to magnify the importance of the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the alumni, it makes up for everything,'' wide receiver R.
Jay Soward said. ``To me, we're still 5-6.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (5-6) now gets a reward for its big victory: a
less-than-scintillating finale Friday against 25th-ranked Louisiana
Tech. But in 10 years, hardly anyone will remember that game. The
same will not be said of defeating UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Linebacker Markus Steele is questionable after
suffering a deep bruise in his stomach after getting stuck by a
cleat during the game. Offensive lineman Jason Grain is unlikely to
return from his knee injury for the final game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
REPORT CARD &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAME: 11 &QL; 
RESULT: USC 17, UCLA 7 &QL; 
RECORD: 5-6, 3-5 &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S GPA: 2.67 &QL; 
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.41 &QL; 
NEXT GAME: Louisiana Tech &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS &QL; 
Would USC be in a bowl if John Fox had started earlier? His most
impressive stat was no turnovers for the second straight game and
he took only two sacks. &QL; 
B &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
Chad Morton went over the 1,000-yard mark by being the Trojans'
workhorse with 143 yards in 36 carries. Sultan McCullough showed
the speed everyone hears about with his 48-yard run. &QL; 
A- &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
Kareem Kelly drew the headlines, but Windrell Hayes made two
impressive catches over the middle. Remember when people worried if
R. Jay Soward would be a factor? &QL; 
B &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Eight false starts is an unmitigated disaster and inexcusable in
the 11th game of the season. Add two holding penalties and you
wonder how the Trojans won. &QL; 
D- &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
All six sacks were registered by linemen, with Matt Childers, Ryan
Nielsen and Lonnie Ford each getting two. They also held UCLA to 45
yards rushing. &QL; 
A- &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
Zeke Moreno had an impact with an interception, forced fumble,
fumble recovery, pass deflection and seven tackles. The rest of the
unit was merely OK. &QL; 
B- &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
Ryan McCann was making his first start, but he had Freddie Mitchell
open all day. It could have been a lot worse if Mitchell hadn't
dropped a couple of passes. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
It's time to admit that the kicking game has been awful, and far
more than just a snapping or blocking problem. USC has made 11 of
21 field goals this season. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
A great deal of Paul Hackett's critics took the weekend off. The
fake field goal was an inspired call, as were the five-receiver
formations. Again, about those 16 penalties. . . &QL;

BIDING HIS TIME IS KNIGHT-MARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Travis Knight spent a month of his summer playing
with rookies and free-agent hopefuls in the summer pro league. A
three-year veteran with a long-term contract, Knight didn't need to
play in Long Beach, but he chose to spend the time learning Los
Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   His payoff? A badly sprained ankle, several weeks of rehab and,
so far, about five minutes per game of playing time. And this on a
team with no depth at power forward and center, Knight's two
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jackson has chosen to play Shaquille O'Neal for 40
minutes a game and use either John Salley or a small lineup instead
of using the 7-foot Knight.
</P>
<P>
   That's partially a reflection on Knight's comfort level on the
court _ Jackson has yanked him quickly for making mistakes _ and
partially a reflection on his health. Knight's right ankle isn't
100 percent healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do the things that I used to do,'' Knight said. ``It's
frustrating for me. There's not a whole lot I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knight has also struggled to gain confidence on the floor,
which isn't helped by his short stints. Not that he's complaining
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's the coach, I trust his judgment,'' he said. ``I'm fine.
I'm trying to get back and find a rhythm. It will come, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, meanwhile, is happy with O'Neal's production in
extended minutes _ witness the 41 points in 43 minutes Friday night
_ and joked, ``I don't know if I'll ever go back to the usual.''
</P>
<P>
   So Knight and Salley might have to wait for garbage time to get
on the court. Jackson said he's also limited Knight because of the
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been giving him short minutes and trying to see if he can
get comfortable out there,'' he said. And has Knight looked
comfortable? ``No. I don't think he's really played to where he
feels good yet. I think he's just feeling his way out there right
now. We'll see what we can find in the rotation. I haven't found
out how to use him yet. That's still us getting to know each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Reaching out: Guard Derek Fisher will pledge $1,000 to Big
Brothers for every assist he gets in the Lakers' Christmas-day game
against the San Antonio Spurs. Fisher will announce the pledge
Saturday during an appearance from 2 to 4 p.m. at The Athletes Foot
in Marina del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also have announced their annual Magic Johnson
Foundation toy drive, which benefits charitable organizations
throughout Los Angeles. Fans are asked to bring toys to any of the
following games: Nov. 24, Dec. 3, Dec. 5 or Dec. 7.!dlim! &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

FRUSTRATED EMMITT HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ In his postgame frustration, Emmitt Smith, the
man with the broken hand, pointed an accusing finger yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' running back pointed to the third quarter. He
pointed to the stats sheet. He pointed to yet another road game
that the fickle Cowboys couldn't sock away.
</P>
<P>
   And in so doing, he directly pointed at the play calling. And
the one who calls those plays, of course, happens to be the head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Emmitt has grumbled about a
perceived slight or a game plan that suddenly, to his dismay, took
to the air. The headline, ``Smith wants football'' is not a novel
one.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of a wrenching, 13-9 loss to the Arizona
Cardinals, Smith's grumblings this time carried an unmistakable
bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you do all the writing with that,'' Smith first said,
when asked whether he thought the Cowboys abandoned the running
game in a telltale third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just frustrating as I-don't-know-what.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the question about the running game was reworded,
and Emmitt was lobbed a verbal softball about the Arizona defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job in the third quarter,'' he answered. ``But
I didn't think we made a legitimate effort to go at them in the
third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ears immediately perked. Please elaborate, someone suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the statistics _ go and check it out,'' Smith
answered.
</P>
<P>
   What Emmitt was referring to was a halftime ledger that listed
him with 83 rushing yards on 18 carries. Smith, broken hand and
all, had come out like a true warrior, dashing through holes that
were there and picking his way through ones that weren't.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to play against the 3-6 Cardinals. He could have
waited and mended for another Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No _ it didn't hurt at all,'' he said after yesterday's game,
though the hand was wrapped in white bandages at least an inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys dominated the first half in _ stop me if you've read
this before _ everything but the scoreboard. They had 12 first
downs (seven on the ground) to the home team's four. They enjoyed a
21:30 to 8:30 edge in time of possession, and this was despite the
absence of redoubtable blocking force Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   But as Emmitt said, ``Go and check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Smith meant, the Cowboys snapped the ball
nine times other than when they were punting. Seven of those snaps
led to pass plays. Smith got the call to run the ball only twice.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the game swung. The Cowboys were never able to
regain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you're backed up, you've got to do certain
things,'' Smith said, couching his earlier remark.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, yes, the Cowboys never snapped the ball
beyond their own 31-yard line. Six of those nine plays were in the
literal shadow of their own goal.
</P>
<P>
   But head coach Chan Gailey, for whatever reason, chose to let
stand-in quarterback Jason Garrett go to the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that,'' Gailey explained. ``We try to keep them off
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of penalties that set us back. We had some
situations that were putting us in bad down-and-distance
situations, coming out of our end zone a couple of times. We tried
to catch them off balance with the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not like we abandoned \Rthe running game\S
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but on a day that cried out for somebody, anybody, in a
Cowboys uniform to make a big play, why Gailey even momentarily
abandoned his proven big-play runner in favor of his backup
quarterback is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Smith had one giant carry, an 18-yard gain on the
Cowboys' second play of the second half, that was called back
because of holding.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Emmitt found his number being regularly called
again, it was the fourth quarter and the offense was trying to play
catch-up, a game it does not engage in well.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's last carry of the day was another riddle. With rookie
Solomon Page subbing for injured Erik Williams at right tackle,
Gailey sent Emmitt off the right side on fourth down-and-one. The
Cardinals' Kwamie Lassiter met him for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey _ I just run what's called,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cowboys' final possession, needing to move 43 yards in
101 seconds, Gailey had Chris Warren, not Smith, in the backfield.
Smith had, indeed, caught a pass earlier in the game, despite the
wrapping on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of coach leaves his best player on the bench on the
game's final, desperate drive?
</P>
<P>
   A 5-5 coach, as it turns out. A coach that says he thinks
everything will be all right, once December comes and his battered
team heals.
</P>
<P>
   A coach that couldn't seem to see yesterday which Cowboy
represented his best chance of beating the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, by all means, Emmitt Smith, let's point fingers.

COME SHOWDOWN TIME, COWBOYS COME UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The final details were grim, but in all honesty,
those details provided a tell-tale ending to an afternoon of
immense offensive frustration, ineptness and yes, sour luck.
</P>
<P>
   Game on the line late in the fourth quarter. Two downs to make 1
yard inside the 10. Can't do it. Game over. Cowboys lose.
</P>
<P>
   But why should it have been any other way? Back-to-back failures
by the Cowboys in that particular showdown situation meant football
justice smiled upon the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   They got what was deserved. A 13-9 victory that left the Cowboys
precious little regrouping time to recover from yet another heavy
dose of despair. But at 5-5, at least the Cowboys have had plenty
of practice this season at attempting to rise from the emotional
ashes of a game that somehow got away.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will be at Texas Stadium on Thursday, and Chan Gailey said
for the next 72 hours he knows what's coming from the multitudes
back home _ a ``ton of the sky is falling'' commentary.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dolphins will no doubt be looking toward Thursday the
same way Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said his club was looking
toward the second half yesterday, trailing 7-3 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players realized this was a football team that was very
beatable today,'' Tobin noted. The Cowboys had certainly left
enough clues on that subject in a first half of yardage dominance
that produced just seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens against Miami, Troy Aikman's postgame
observation here yesterday suggested it wouldn't be with him as a
sideline spectator for the third consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing,'' said Aikman, although Gailey was not close to
being that definite when asked after yesterday's game. Due to the
state of his noggin, Aikman will have to receive medical clearance
to return. For what it's worth, Troy has already given himself that
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about urgency, of course. The season is on the edge,
even in the totally-up-for-grabs National Foo-Foo Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was considered a swing game for the Cowboys _ a chance
to pad the victory column against a Cardinals club that was a
meager 3-6 and also without its top quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   All wrongs through nearly four quarters could have been made
right in the final minutes. The Cowboys were driving behind Emmitt
Smith and a pounding ground game that had again found its
first-half steam.
</P>
<P>
   When Emmitt bounced up the middle for 8 big yards, it left the
Cowboys with a second-and-two from the Arizona 10. But disaster
struck right there. Right tackle Erik Williams was injured on the
play, knocked woozy by a blow to the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, offensive-line coach Hudson Houck had to reshuffle up
front. With Larry Allen injured last week, Houck was already
testing his depth. When Williams went down, he moved rookie Solomon
Page to right tackle from left guard, and brought in Tom Myslinski
at Page's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing went right after that. Emmitt got a single yard up the
middle on second down, was stuffed for no-gain on third, and then
tested the right side on the critical fourth-and-one. He appeared
to have daylight inside, but broke outside, and was smacked down
for a devastating no gain.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, with 3:22 to play, Emmitt's big yardage afternoon
(he finished with 127 yards on 29 carries) meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that was an excuse,'' said Houck, meaning
the unlucky Williams injury and the quick changes up front. ``But
that's what you look at the film for _ to see where the breakdowns
were. It's just a shame it got to that point. We certainly had the
opportunities to have this game taken care of earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Like in the first half, of course, when the Cowboys had a
touchdown pass to Ernie Mills nullified on a play-clock violation,
and a 38-yard field goal wiped out on a holding penalty _ both on
the same possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really a devastating afternoon for a bunch of proud
men,'' Houck said. ``It hurts. But we've hurt before, and bounced
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had done just that in last week's victory against
Green Bay, except Jason Garrett couldn't duplicate that quarterback
relief performance yesterday. Garrett threw for a meager 111 yards,
and while making no glaring mistake, also generated nothing after
capping a first-quarter drive with a TD pass to tight end David
LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   This loss, however, was not about Garrett. And despite the
first-half frustration, and a third quarter without a first down,
the Cowboys were still where they needed to be at the end of the
game. The opportunity to win was there.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Arizona Cardinals who seized that opportunity,
and sent a reeling team back to Dallas, trying to regroup in time
for the Dolphins. Not even Jimmy Johnson, from way down there in
Miami, could have scripted this ending any better.

COWBOYS AGAIN JUMP TO LEAD BUT FALTER DOWN THE STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ This is becoming a tired story. If it ever goes
Hollywood, the part of the Cowboys will be played by the rabbit who
starred in ``The Tortoise and the Hare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have scored first in every game this season. They've
never trailed at halftime. Yet they're 5-5 after losing 13-9 in
another game of self-destruction yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   This time it came against an Arizona Cardinals team that two
weeks ago was considered to have its bags packed and waiting by the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Cowboys are the ones feeling despair. They did manage
to get a good look at the enemy yesterday and make a positive I.D.
The enemy, as you might have expected by now, wore big blue stars
on the side of their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Cowboys team that came into yesterday's game leading
the NFL in penalty yardage (717) and was third only to Chicago and
Cincinnati in total penalties (72), then did nothing to diminish
their hold (no pun intended) on ignominy.
</P>
<P>
   Injured wide receiver Michael Irvin apparently went off angrily
inside the losing locker room immediately after the game. Nobody
was happy. Nobody liked what they had just seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penalties killed us. We can't have it, and this isn't the
first time it's happened, either,'' said Cowboys center Mark
Stepnoski. ``Considering all the personnel that we have out \Rwith
injuries\S right now, we're already at enough of a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make it any harder on ourselves by letting positive plays
be negated by penalties, or taking points off the board ... well,
we're not that good to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys find themselves at .500 again after having gotten
off to a 3-0 start with a 35-7 victory against these same Cardinals
seven weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have lost five road games in row and are 3-3 against
NFC East teams, which they swept a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   They face a mini-Mount Everest as they try to get back into the
NFC East race. Washington is 6-4 after beating the New York Giants,
23-13, yesterday. The Giants are 5-5, and have beaten the Cowboys
once this season with the rematch scheduled for Jan. 2 at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not good enough right now to lose scoring
opportunities,'' said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey. ``We're getting
penalties at critical times. That's what is getting us right now
... \Ralthough\S I don't know when there is a noncritical time for
a penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, none were bigger than two flags on the same Cowboys drive
in the second quarter. Jason Garrett, making his second consecutive
start for the injured Troy Aikman (concussions), hit Ernie Mills
for what appeared to be a 26-yard touchdown pass, but a flag was
thrown for delay of game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I did not think the play was sent in
late, and I didn't think there was any way that we were in a
delay-of-game situation,'' said Gailey, who noticed two plays later
that the 25-second clock had to be reset because it started early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened. ... I didn't think it was an
abnormal situation where we were even close to a delay of game.''
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Richie Cunningham kicked a 38-yard field
goal, but the play was erased by a holding call on Robert Thomas.
Cunningham then missed a 48-yard attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a judgment call,'' Thomas said. ``The guy anchored
himself, and it looked to the official, I guess, like I wrapped
around him. The same thing happened the next time, and they didn't
call anything. Was I surprised \Rto be flagged\S? Sure, what player
ain't?''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Cowboys looked comfortable early. Garrett's
11-yard touchdown pass to tight end David LaFleur gave the Cowboys
a 7-0 first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith played with a broken hand _ a metal plate and six
screws were inserted 12 days ago _ and rushed for 83 of his 127
yards by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona comeback began late in the half when the Cowboys
found themselves pinned back at their own 7 following an
unnecessary-roughness penalty called on rookie Ebenezer Ekuban on a
punt return.
</P>
<P>
   After forcing a Cowboys punt, the Cardinals turned a short field
into a 24-yard field goal by Chris Jacke just before halftime. The
Cowboys had dominated the first half (21 1/2 minutes to 8 1/2
minutes in time of possession and 180 to 55 yards in total
offense), yet they led only 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona scored on its first possession of the second half with
Dave Brown, subbing for the injured Jake Plummer, hitting Rob Moore
for a 21-yard touchdown pass less than two minutes into the third
quarter. The Cardinals led 10-7 and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cardinals are ranked 29th offensively in the NFL,
the Cowboys were in the game to the bitter end. Smith was stopped
in his tracks on a fourth-and-one attempt off right tackle from the
Arizona 9 with less than 3 1/2 minutes left, on a play in which
right tackle Erik Williams was out of the game because of a blow to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game of ``almosts'' for the Cowboys. In the third
quarter, Raghib Ismail made what appeared to be an acrobatic catch
of a 36-yard Garrett pass at the Arizona 43. But the Cardinals
challenged the call, and it was overturned by instant replay. The
Cowboys came away with no points on that drive.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Cowboys had a chance to win it at the end. After the
Cardinals took a safety rather than punt out of their own end zone,
Deion Sanders, playing with groin and hamstring strains, returned
the free kick 31 yards to the Arizona 43.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the ball with 1:41 left in the game, the Cowboys'
offense ran eight plays, picking up a first down on a
fourth-and-one pass to Chris Warren for 5 yards at the Arizona 29.
But four plays later, this time facing fourth-and-three, Garrett
hit Ismail, who was stopped by J.J. McCleskey short of the first
down.
</P>
<P>
   And all those earlier missed opportunities came rushing back for
every player who wore a blue star on the side of his helmet.

UW OWES ITS FOOTBALL PLAYERS A MILLION THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In former Seahawks coach Chuck Knox's endless supply
of hoary football aphorisms was one that explained the University
of Washington's semi-astonishing season as well as anything:
</P>
<P>
   It's not always who you play, Knox said, but when you play 'em.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Huskies happened to catch Oregon on Oct. 2
with the Ducks' top two running backs injured loomed as large as
anything in getting the Huskies to the Holiday Bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   Beating the Ducks that day, 34-20, not only opened the
conference season with a good buzz, it paid off at the end. The 7-4
Huskies were chosen for the San Diego game largely because of the
win over the 8-3 Ducks, who finished tied in league with Washington
at 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   In a sea of meaningless postseason games, the Ducks ended up
with one of college football's larger booby prizes, the Sun Bowl.
Not to demean the good folks of El Paso, but as a reward, the game
plainly sucks. Not only is it on the wind-swept desert of West
Texas, but this year it is played on a New Year's Eve that is not
only historic, but potentially hysterical, owing to the Y2K
doomsayers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Seattle wants to be there, especially the Huskies,
some of whom wondered privately about opting out. It wasn't the
first time the urge was felt at Montlake: Many of the '86 Huskies
wanted no part of El Paso on Christmas Day, but the attempted
rebellion was quashed by then-coach Don James.
</P>
<P>
   At least this year's Holiday Bowl is on Dec. 29, leaving time to
get back to the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego dalliance holds another virtue, besides the
beaches and warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holiday Bowl is for the No. 2 Pac-10 team, which is what
we are,'' said Barbara Hedges, Washington's athletic director. As
one who has been on a toasty seat since January, when she hired
Rick Neuheisel, Hedges couldn't be more proud, not to mention
relieved that she and the program didn't spontaneously combust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty amazing how this season evolved,'' she said
after the 24-14 Apple Cup win over Washington State on a November
Saturday for which the term ``bleak'' was invented. ``The best
thing that I can say about what happened is that Rick and his staff
embraced this team, and the team embraced the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the usual football analysis about zone blitzes and
option pitches, Hedges' expression sounds a little squishy. But
given what transpired in the Pac-10, which has not played football
this badly since the USS Milwaukee and Aberdeen High School were on
the schedule for Huskies coach Gil Dobie, little things such as
trust and commitment were assets as valuable as anything.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching change from the Jim Lambright regime could have
gone south this season, even when the logic for change was there.
But the senior leadership, despite misgivings and careers full of
annoyances and disappointments, gave Neuheisel the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided they were going to buy into the change and do
everything they could to take Husky football to the level they
wanted it to be,'' Neuheisel said. ``They put it back on top, at
least in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seniors made sure this wasn't a rebuilding year.''
</P>
<P>
   A sweep of their Northwest rivals restored what the Huskies
consider the rightful order and took considerable heat off
Neuheisel's $1 million-a-year contract, as well as his recruiting
blunders that brought minor sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of football people, not just in the Pac-10 but nationally,
were eager for Neuheisel to fall on his face. Fortunately for him,
none were his own players.
</P>
<P>
   While some will lament the lost opportunity for the Rose Bowl,
the fact that the Huskies made any bowl remains remarkable,
particularly after an 0-2 start. Aside from quarterback Marques
Tuiasosopo, this is a team of surpassing ordinariness.
</P>
<P>
   But so was the rest of the Pac-10. With the exception of WSU, a
handkerchief could have been thrown over the other nine teams and
nothing would have stuck out. Having Stanford as conference champ
for the first time since bushy sideburns says it all. It's like Don
Knotts winning a Frank Sinatra impersonation contest.
</P>
<P>
   But opportunity comes to ordinary teams, too, and advantage must
be taken. That's what the Huskies did Oct. 2. The Ducks finished
1999 with a 35-point scoring average that ranks in the top 10
nationally, but on that afternoon in Husky Stadium, injuries to
tailbacks Reuben Droughns and Herman Ho-Ching helped hold the Ducks
to 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies did not hold another conference team to under 21
points until Saturday. Nor did the Huskies, with the exception of a
freakish start against Oregon State, beat up on an opponent. Nearly
every Saturday was a cliff-hanger that created endless what-if
games for the second-guessers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first guesses by Neuheisel and his staff worked out.
The wins against the other halfway decent conference members,
Stanford and Arizona, were largely tests of will that would not
have worked had the players not bought into Neuheisel and his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The wins also paid off Hedges' gamble on Neuheisel, who had won
little of significance as a head coach yet pulled down a stupendous
salary and a gym full of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some people's minds, it was a big risk,'' she said. ``In my
mind, it wasn't at all. It was apparent to me that Rick was the
very best for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real risk was the question about what Rick was being
paid. It was not an insignificant issue, but the reality was Rick
was paid very well at Colorado. For him to leave, we had to put
together a very good package.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges called Neuheisel on the search's first day, and both
agreed it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was something lingering,'' Hedges said. ``We stayed
in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel returned Hedges' calls after midnight. Often they
would talk until 2 a.m. Finally, Neuheisel said, ``Make it a
blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges did. So Neuheisel said yes. Colorado, and the rest of the
college jockocracy, said, ``Ohmigawd.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took the Husky players saying, ``OK,'' before the biggest
off-season coaching story not only averted disaster, but made the
breaks pay off in three months of restoration of the Huskies'
football profile.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it won't last. Maybe the Pac-10 will again play serious
football. For now, it isn't El Paso in the dark, it's the UW
football program in the light.

SEAHAWKS SMACK CHIEFS FOR FIFTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As the Kansas City Chiefs were driving the
ball right at Seattle's patchwork defense on the game's opening
series, feelings of self-doubt and visions of yet another
disheartening loss in Arrowhead Stadium had to be consuming the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Not these Seahawks. Maybe the Seahawks of seasons past that had
not won here since 1990 and had a lone, one-point victory to show
for their past 17 trips to what had become their personal house of
horrors.
</P>
<P>
   But not this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. Never,'' said quarterback Jon Kitna, who was equal
parts perturbed and defiant that anyone would even broach such an
obvious subject. ``We don't have that kind of attitude around here
anymore. This is not the same old Seahawks. We never feel like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's beginning to look more and more like these really aren't
the same old Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Their 31-19 victory over the Chiefs Sunday was just the latest
step, and one of the largest, in proving it.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' fifth consecutive victory pushed their AFC
West-leading record to 8-2, giving them a three-game lead over the
Chiefs (5-5) and a 2{-game edge over the Oakland Raiders, who are
5-4 entering their game against the Broncos in Denver tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of having a three-game cushion with six games to
play, coupled with this rarest of triumphs at Arrowhead, should
have signaled the point where history gave way to hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Not these Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge win for us. No doubt,'' running back Ricky
Watters said. ``But every time you win it makes the next game even
bigger. We just have to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks won Sunday as they have won so many times this
season. Despite not playing their best, they made key plays at
critical junctures of the game:
</P>
<P>
   -- Like the injury-depleted defense, which was playing without
leading tackler Darren Smith and disruptive defensive tackle Sam
Adams, and had strong safety Darryl Williams for only part-time
duty and Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Sinclair playing at only
partial speed.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing the Chiefs 71 yards on that initial drive _ which
ended in a Pete Stoyanovich field goal because Sinclair pressured
Elvis Grbac into throwing away a third-down pass _ and giving up
another 71 on a second-quarter possession _ which didn't end until
Donnell Bennett had slammed into the end zone _ the Seahawks
limited the Chiefs to 111 yards on their next seven series as
Seattle's offense was pushing to a 24-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play 60 minutes. We are going to fight,''
linebacker Chad Brown said. ``But it would be nice to have a game
where we go for the jugular, rip it out and just bite on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Brown quickly added: ``We had a lot of guys who had to play
hurt and guys who had to come in for guys who couldn't even play.
So we really sucked it up. It was a pretty good effort for a team
that's hobbled.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Like the offense, which did not get a reception from leading
receiver Derrick Mayes and saw Kitna complete less than 50 percent
of his passes (14 of 33) for the first time this season, but still
managed to score the most points against the Chiefs at Arrowhead
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the slack were Watters, who scored three touchdowns
while rushing for 107 yards and catching four passes for 67 yards,
and Sean Dawkins, who highlighted his five-catch, 114-yard
afternoon with a 45-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City has a very stout run defense, but we felt we
needed to run,'' coach Mike Holmgren said. ``We haven't scared
anybody running the ball this year, but we are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we were able to run the ball and the fact that
Ricky gets a couple of touchdowns makes my life better.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Like the special teams, whose generally solid efforts all
season have been blemished by intermittent twinges of
inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Feagles picked a most opportune time to snap out of his
recent slump, dropping punts at the Chiefs 9 and 14 to help the
Seahawks outscore KC 17-6 in the second half. Feagles' best, and
most timely, effort came in the third quarter when his 26-yarder
was fair caught at the Chiefs 9 after Holmgren decided against
trying a 47-yard field goal
</P>
<P>
   ``Feags made the perfect punt,'' Holmgren said. ``If he punts
the ball into the end zone, no one looks very smart on that. But he
put it down, we held them, got good field position and we scored
(on Dawkins' TD catch).''
</P>
<P>
   As they have done so many times this season, the Seahawks found
a way to win on a day when they didn't play up to their own
expectations. And they did it in front of a boisterous crowd of
78,714 to run their road record to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was another step in a season of small strides. Still, it was
a giant leap toward the franchise's first playoff berth since 1988
and perhaps even its first division title since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's done yet. We have some real tough games ahead of
us,'' Holmgren said of a schedule that includes this week's game
against Tampa Bay at the Kingdome and then rematches with each of
the four AFC West teams before closing the regular season at the
New York Jets. ``I'm just proud of the fact that the team has
managed to stay focused, one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   With that said, Holmgren added what can be used to keep his team
focused, even after it removed the Arrowhead jinx.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at times looked like we haven't figured the whole thing out
yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Look ahead? Not with this coach. Not these Seahawks, who are
proving week by week that they are not the same old Seahawks.

UNITED RULES AGAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; FOXBORO, Mass. _ Whether it's the rain, winds or beautiful blue
skies that hung over Foxboro Stadium on Sunday _ nothing seems to
go right in this town for the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   For another season and possibly many more to follow, the Galaxy
will have to deal with another blown opportunity. A few days ago,
it was the only Western Conference team to reach the MLS
championship twice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's the only team to blow it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after D.C. United scored three goals in the final 21
minutes to beat the Galaxy by a goal in a muddy monsoon to claim
the inaugural trophy _ United added another championship, its third
in four years, with a 2-0 victory over Los Angeles in front of
44,910.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it likes it or not, this is a franchise yet to prove it
can win the big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always going to linger and it's always going to be
there,'' defender Danny Pena said of the Galaxy's history in title
games. `It's not something we are going to forget or the fans are
going to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``As players, it's always something you're going to remember.
You don't get too many opportunities like this, but you have to
move forward and keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts as bad as it can hurt right now. But somehow, when
training starts next year, we've got to turn this into motivation
to get back to this game.''
</P>
<P>
   What will make this defeat tougher to deal with than '96 were
the freak events that went against Los Angeles in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the match, Galaxy defender Robin Fraser took a
nasty forearm from Roy Lassiter to his back, sending the MLS
defender of the year to the turf, which broke his collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first half, Cobi Jones beat United defender
John Maessner to the right of United's goal. Maessner swiped at
Jones, clipping his heel, but no penalty kick was called.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman received a
bouncing ball to the goal area from Steve Jolley. Lassiter rushed
on as Hartman nearly tripped trying to free himself. Hartman
avoided disaster, but he stumbled again trying to make a routine
play. He chunked a pass like a weekend hacker, giving a free ball
to United's Ben Olsen, who fired into an empty net to give United
its second goal of the match.
</P>
<P>
   One minute it looked like the Galaxy would tie the game with a
penalty before intermission. The next minute, it was down 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, disgusted earlier when Lassiter wasn't
blown for a foul on Fraser, nearly lost it when no foul was called
on Maessner. He walked off at halftime screaming at referee Tim
Weyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, losing Fraser, who has a broken collarbone, was
significant and it's an amazing feat that such a gifted athlete
like Robin would fall down on his own without a call,'' a sarcastic
Schmid said. ``On Cobi, I have the benefit of the big-screen
replay, but I guess that picture's fuzzy. It certainly looked like
he was taken down in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   That was press-conference talk. Minutes later, Schmid explained
how he really felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might as well say it, and they can fine me for it, but I
thought the referring was crap,'' Schmid said. ``I thought the
refereeing impacted the game. It wasn't just the non-call on
Fraser, but it was several calls that continually changed the
course of the game. I don't want to take anything away from D.C.,
they played a great game, but we deserved better officiating in a
championship than that.''
</P>
<P>
   United's opening goal in the 19th minute was also opportunistic.
Hartman made a brilliant save from an initial shot from Lassiter.
Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri was there to clear it off the line
but got tangled with Hartman, losing the ball off his toe to Jamie
Moreno, who had an easy tap-in to the right netting.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy had chances to score, missing two golden
opportunities in the first half. A Pena header from a Greg Vanney
corner kick hit the post. Earlier, Jones almost scored on a through
pass from Ezra Hendrickson, but United defender Carlos Llamosa
cleared it out at the last second.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a difference, however, it was United's toughness
and the man-marking job D.C.'s Richie Williams did on Galaxy
playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   United seemed to be more physical than the Galaxy _ winning most
of the one-on-one battles, leaving Los Angeles out of sync at
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I thought we did a fairly good job,'' Schmid said.
``I just think there was a lot of stuff that wasn't called.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, the Galaxy's midfield general, admitted he was taken
out of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was marked real tight most of the time and I was receiving
the ball at my back,'' Cienfuegos said. ``I didn't have much space
to turn. There was tight marking on me all day and I was never able
to turn and get off some passes off.''

WAIT 'TIL THIS TEAM GETS IT TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. It will
be downright frightening when the 1999 Seattle Seahawks actually
put together a real-live, honest-to-goodness, dominating
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because if the Hawks can go into Arrowhead Stadium, as they did
Sunday, and put up a 31-19 victory over the Chiefs despite missing
two key defensive starters, despite a so-so day from quarterback
Jon Kitna, despite an as-yet underutilized Joey Galloway and
despite enough dropped passes to make you think it could have been
51-19, then watch out when all of that actually goes right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a league-wide warning should be issued on behalf of the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Like: If you think that a record of 8-2 is gaudy and probably
Teflon-coated in terms of a playoff berth, just wait until the
Hawks really get their act together.
</P>
<P>
   We may be talking first-round bye. We may be talking home-field
advantage. We may be talking AFC Championship game. And, yes, why
not just go ahead and pin the tail on the donkey.
</P>
<P>
   Start visualizing Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you see Cortez Kennedy and Michael Sinclair riding down
one of those ubiquitous Peachtree Streets in limos?
</P>
<P>
   Can't you see Kitna in the middle of the Super Bowl media swarm,
that shaved head bobbing and that big kid-next-door heart pulsing
to the beat of the biggest sideshow on Earth?
</P>
<P>
   Can't you see Ricky Watters volunteering to rap with Puff Daddy
during the Nestle Crunch/Volkswagen Beetle/Hanes Underwear/Charmin
Toilet Tissue halftime show?
</P>
<P>
   Can't you see Mike Holmgren cooly holding court all the way
until the last Sunday in January _ a day we're beginning to suspect
the guy believes he should own.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, this call for postseason glory would be a
tradition known as ``cranking up the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   This call would have been appropriate in any week since the
Hawks went to Green Bay and dumped on the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Monday Night Football'' victory was impressive, as was
their comeback victory over the Bengals. Last week, the Hawks were
just resilient enough to stave off a defensively angry Denver team,
while Sunday, the Hawks used just enough weapons on just enough
right calls to keep the Chiefs in an Arrowhead stew.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, just off a groin injury that still looked like it
bothered him, had the defensive gem of the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the Chiefs trailing 23-13, Sinclair flushed quarterback
Elvis Grbac out of the pocket and over to the sideline where,
brainlocked, Grbac neglected to get rid of the ball and instead
stepped out of bounds with the ball in his hands, taking an 11-yard
sack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that alone was enough to kill the drive. What if injured
tackle Sam Adams and lineback Darrin Smith had been available?
</P>
<P>
   Elvis would have left the building _ hair on fire, in fear.
</P>
<P>
   To be smart, though, all this Seahawks bandwagon cranking must
come with an official warning: This is no juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   At times, like in the third quarter with the Hawks up only
14-13, Kitna overthrew balls to the likes of Sean Dawkins or Itula
Mili and Ricky Watters to cripple a drive. It seemed as if the kid
with only a dozen NFL starts under his belt might buckle under the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at times looked like we haven't figured the whole thing out
yet,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on that drive, when Kitna saw Mili lined up as a wide
receiver with no cover guy on him, Kitna took the snap and
immediately threw to him behind the line _ only Mili had already
run about five yards past the line and was helpless except to watch
the ball skitter away on the grass behind him.
</P>
<P>
   With that slim, one-point lead, tensions were high enough that
Mili and Kitna actually yelled at each other. Mili pushed Kitna's
hand away in anger as he ran off the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the poise of Kitna to continue to try and make plays is what
makes the Seahawks so competitive. The calls are there. The game
plans are solid. The book on what the Hawks opponents are going to
do is so thoroughly digested by the Seahawks that they took a
blitzing Chiefs team and drew them into exactly the sort of
coverage Holmgren told his team to expect.
</P>
<P>
   It allowed the Hawks to sprinkle several big offensive plays
into a game plan that called for conservatism in the face of the
Chiefs' blitzing and ball-hawking.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, early in the second quarter, after Kitna had
thrown two incomplete passes deep in KC territory, the Hawks had a
third-and-10 on the Kansas City 22-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Kitna took the snap and the Chiefs sent four lineman
in to blitz, it was immediately clear that the Hawks had made the
perfect call. Kitna, under attack, just dumped the ball in the flat
to Watters, who ran the screen pass in for the unscathed touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only call in that situation, otherwise you throw
the ball into the dirt,'' said an ecstatic Watters, who scored
three TDs by carrying for 107 yards and adding 67 more on four
catches to lead the Hawks to their AFC West victory.
</P>
<P>
   In a football stadium in which the Seahawks had not won a game
since 1990, the fact that Holmgren's playbook was open just enough
to ensure just enough timely ammunition helped the team discard
another bit of heavy baggage.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, despite the momentus history of this victory, what
strikes you most about this team is that it seems completely
disconnected with all that losing, all that it was.
</P>
<P>
   Where this team's going is the only story right now. And if and
when these Hawks start to really click, well, why not visualize
Atlanta? Secretly, the Seahawks are.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   __ Nov. 26, 1989: The Rams' Flipper Anderson breaks the NFL
receiving-yards-in-a-game record with 366 against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nov. 27, 1924: A record 57,000 see Los Angeles High tie
Polytechnic High 7-7. It's the largest crowd then on record to
watch a high school football game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nov. 27, 1965: UCLA's freshman team beats the varsity 75-60
in the first basketball game played at Pauley Pavilion.
Eighteen-year-old freshman Lew Alcindor, who, like the rest of his
class, isn't eligible to play varsity, scores 31 points and has 21
rebounds. The varsity Bruins are the two-time defending NCAA
champions and will go on to an 18-8 mark this season but fail to
make the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   __ Nov. 28, 1964: In the first coaching meeting between John
McKay and Ara Parseghian, USC upsets unbeaten Notre Dame 20-17 on
Craig Fertig's 17-yard TD pass to Rod Sherman before 83,840 at the
Coliseum to knock the Irish out of a certain national championship.
But the celebration ends quickly. The 7-3 Trojans find out hours
later that the Athletic Association of Western Universities has
voted to send 8-2 Oregon State to the Rose Bowl instead to face
Michigan. (49)
</P>
<P>
   __ Birthdays: Tuesday: L.A. native and basketball Hall of Famer
George Yardley (71). Wednesday: Former Dodgers catcher Steve Yeager
(51) and former UCLA basketball star and USC basketball coach Henry
Bibby (50). Friday: Angels pitcher Chuck Finley (37), former L.A.
Raiders coach Art Shell (53). Saturday: New Angels manager and
former Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia (41). &QL;

SINCLAIR TURNS INTO REAL PAIN FOR CHIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Michael Sinclair stretched that old line
about playing in pain to absurd lengths Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a pulled groin that kept him on the sideline last
week, the Seahawks' Pro Bowl defensive end pressured Elvis Grbac
into a sack and three incompletions in the Seahawks' 31-19 victory
over the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play bad. I wanted to help this team win,''
Sinclair said after being on the winning end at Arrowhead Stadium
for the first time in his nine-year career. ``This was a huge game,
and if we're going to slay some demons I want to take out my little
six-inch pocket knife and jab him in the side, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sinclair was wielding the pass-rush equivalent of a
hunting knife, if not a machete.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs' game-opening drive stalled at the Seahawks 12
because Sinclair flushed Grbac from the pocket and forced him to
throw the ball away. Sinclair did it two other times in the second
quarter. But his rapier move came in the fourth quarter when
Sinclair chased Grbac out of bounds for an 11-yard sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably my worst play of the day,'' said Grbac, who
completed 30 of 49 passes for 322 yards. ``I should have gotten rid
of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't, so it ended up being Sinclair's best play of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting, I really was,'' Sinclair said. ``But adrenalin
is the best kind of medicine because it really helps you to give
what you've got. Your body knows. It says. `Hey, I'm injured, but
I'll go ahead and shoot a little morphine in there for you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never won here,'' he said. ``So I'm going to drive a
stake in the ground and declare when we come here we're going to
make it a competitive situation and we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   SUN SCREEN: The Chiefs repeatedly burned the Seahawks with
screen passes. Grbac picked up 82 of his yards on short passes that
running backs Rashaan Shehee and Tony Richardson turned into long
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screens were killing us,'' strong safety Darryl Williams
said. ``He just caught us in a defense that was vulnerable to the
screens, but we still could have made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   COME BLOW YOUR HORN: Chiefs wide receiver Joe Horn provided some
extra incentive the Seahawks really didn't need with his scathing
comments last week about Seahawks cornerback Shawn Springs, whom he
called ``adequate''; quarterback Jon Kitna, whom he said would be
knocked off his roll by the KC defense; and the Seattle defensive
front, which he said was living on the team's 7-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of fired us up,'' Sinclair said. ``I thought he was a
spokesman for the atmosphere. Not that he was saying that, but he
was like the figure head for the atmosphere. I thought we
responded. A lot of guys didn't go in and make it personal against
him. We were like, `OK, if you're going to call us out and
challenge us like that, let's play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   BROWN IS GOLDEN: With leading tackler Darrin Smith sidelined
with a pulled groin, linebacker Chad Brown helped pick up the slack
for the Seahawks defense. Brown had six tackles, tipped two of
Grbac's passes on blitzes and forced a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we had a good game plan and I thought we executed
well,'' Chiefs wide receiver Derrick Alexander said. ``I think
their defense stepped it up.''
</P>
<P>
   STAT-IC: The Chiefs had more yards (373-369) and first downs
(22-20), a better third-down conversion percentage (.470-.333) and
ran more plays (76-65) than the Seahawks. But they lost were it
counted most _ on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the game as late as the end of the third quarter;
we were in the game as late as five or six minutes to go,'' Chiefs
coach Gunther Cunningham said, ``and we don't make the plays to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   STAT DU JOUR: With 107 yards, Ricky Watters moved past Jim
Taylor into 14th place on the NFL's all-time rushing list with
8,685 yards. That Packers' Hall of Fame fullback had 8,597.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: CB Willie Williams suffered a concussion in the
fourth quarter, but after the game he said he was feeling OK. It
was the only injury of consequence for the already battered
Seahawks. . . . SS Kerry Joseph started for Darryl Williams, who
was slowed by a sore hamstring. But Williams was able to play in
the nickel defense and finished with six tackles. . . . Despite the
loss, the Chiefs are 16-3 against AFC West opponents at Arrowhead
Stadium since 1995. . . . The Seahawks' 92-yard scoring drive in
the second quarter was their longest of the season, and the longest
of the year against the Chiefs.

   PHOENIX _ Gary Payton sat undaunted in the visitors' locker room
with an ice pack wrapped around his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Ruben Patterson had kicked the Sonics point guard the
day before, bruising his calf and forcing him to play with padded
support.
</P>
<P>
   However, Payton took his induction into the damaged-goods
section of the Sonics' roster like he did their early demanding
schedule, which ended with four games in fives nights and a 99-86
loss Sunday to the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got through the (tough schedule) pretty good to me,''
Payton said after the Sonics had their four-game winning streak
snapped at America West Arena. ``Now it's over. ... I ain't worried
about this game. They caught us when they wanted to catch us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from emphasizing that they will be better prepared when
Phoenix pops up on the schedule Jan. 11, the Sonics know, too, they
will at least be well-rested and healthier for their next game.
</P>
<P>
   After playing nine games (seven on the road) in 14 days, the
Sonics have the next four days off before hosting the L.A. Clippers
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rest could not come at a better time for a more banged up
team.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Barry did not play Sunday because of a hip pointer.
Patterson has a sore left knee and sprained left ankle. Vin Baker,
who sat out Saturday against Houston, was recovering from the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani McCoy (sprained right ankle) and Shammond Williams
(bruised right thigh) didn't make the trip so they could continue
treatment in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   No one is feeling sorry for the 9-3 Sonics. Not even the
surprisingly 9-3 Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Sonics trailed only 83-81 with 5:02 left in the
game, they weren't far from pulling out their best victory of the
young season. However, fatigue became a factor as the Sonics
faltered down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Jason Kidd made back-to-back baskets _ a short jumper
and a 3-pointer _ followed by Rodney Rogers' uncontested layup. The
Sonics, looking tired and disenchanted, struggled to get back on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The result was watching the Suns (7-4) finish the game with a
16-5 spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being in the game throughout, the Sonics never had an
answer for Kidd. He nearly finished with a triple-double,
collecting 25 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds. Kidd's
uncharacteristic but timely 3-point shooting was deadly. He made
4-of-5 shots from long range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to playing these guys again,'' said guard
Vernon Maxwell, who led the Sonics with 20 points off the bench.
``They can't beat us. No disrespect to their players, but we're a
better team than they are. We took their best punch, and we could
have still won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, anytime the Sonics' backcourt is off, winning becomes
increasing difficult. Maxwell converted just seven of his 20 shots.
And Payton struggled to the tune of 11 points on 3-for-14 shooting
with nine assists and six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Emanual Davis started in place of the injured Barry, but was
ineffective. He missed 7 of 8 shots and finished with two points,
three assists and two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd and Anfernee Hardaway controlled the backcourt duel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won some tough games in some tough situations,'' Payton
said. ``Tonight wasn't our night. It was just one of those games.
They knew we had played a lot, and they just went at us and
attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Sonics did not look the part of the walking
wounded in jumping out to an early 20-11 lead. But the Suns
outworked the Sonics on the boards in the first half, gathering 10
offensive rebounds that became second-chance scores. Clifford
Robinson' put-back dunk put the Suns ahead 47-46 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed by 10 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatigue played a big part,'' forward Horace Grant said. ``We
had a lot of energy in the first quarter-and-a-half, and we just
really ran out of gas. We couldn't get our legs under our shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, though, was one where the Sonics took solace in
knowing they could have played much better. They shot just 38
percent as a group, and turned the ball over 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had been averaging 46-percent shooting and just 13.8
turnovers going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, for running on fumes, we still had a chance to win
the game,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``Ordinarily, we are
very good at taking care of the ball, but we turned it over on some
fast breaks where we had a chance to bring it right down to the
wire. ... As banged up as we are and as tired as we are, I was
proud of this team.''

POLICE HOPE TO SHORTEN CAREER OF COUNTDOWN ROBBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There's one way, if you're a bad guy, to know
you've hit the big time.
</P>
<P>
   You get a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty Boy Floyd. Baby Face Nelson. The Unabomber. They live in
infamy, known as much by their legendary sobriquets as by their
real names.
</P>
<P>
   You get a nickname, it means one thing: You're pretty good at
being real bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to add one to the list: the Countdown Robber.
</P>
<P>
   He has robbed 15 banks in Kansas, Missouri and Omaha, Neb.,
since Feb. 2, 1996. His most recent heist was Oct. 21 at a North
American Savings Bank in Lee's Summit, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, it's the same routine: The Countdown Robber enters
the bank, announces a robbery and orders everyone to lie face down
on the floor. He either gets the money himself or has a teller do
it for him.
</P>
<P>
   On his way out, he tells those in the bank not to get up until
they have counted from 100 to zero. Then he flees.
</P>
<P>
   He has brandished a handgun during each robbery. He has yet to
use it, Lanza said, but he is demanding, even authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities won't disclose how much the Countdown Robber has
stolen so far, but the average take nationally for a bank robbery
is about $4,000, said Sonia Barbara, spokeswoman for the American
Banking Association in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Countdown Robber's method has made him the most prolific
area bank robber since the T-Shirt Bandit, Lanza said. That thief,
later identified as Robert Dee O'Kane, hit 23 banks _ netting more
than $300,000 _ before being busted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Countdown Robber has been particularly exasperating to
authorities. He has been featured twice on the television show
``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lanza said, authorities have no leads on him. No getaway
car model, no license plate number, not a single sighting after he
leaves a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a little frustrated,'' Lanza conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of leads indicates that the man may live outside the
area and travel to his heists. He may even hold a full-time job,
Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   He is described as white, 30 to 40 years old, 6 feet 2 inches
tall and 200 to 230 pounds, with a medium build. He has short, dark
blond or light brown hair and a mustache. He usually wears
wire-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like a white-collar type guy,'' Lanza said. ``He's
probably recently taken up robbing banks, and that would be unusual
in a midlife situation. But who knows what his criminal background
is.''
</P>
<P>
   That profile doesn't fit that of typical bank robbers, who tend
to be drug-addicted people in their 20s looking for quick cash,
Barbara said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Barbara said, the Countdown Robber's professionalism
probably has contributed to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most (bank robbers) are inexperienced and don't put a lot of
thought into it,'' Barbara said. ``If they're experienced, their
goal is to get the money and get out, so they're not likely to
cause an incident.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Countdown Robber continues his spree, Lanza said, the law
of averages will catch up with him. The FBI's Kansas City branch
clears about 60 percent of area bank robberies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank security measures such as exploding dye packs in the money
or silent alarm systems should help trip him up, Barbara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, we usually get a lucky break,'' Lanza said.
``It's kind of surprising he's been able to get away so far. It's a
combination of maybe his ability and some lucky breaks. Fifteen is,
without a doubt, a large number of bank robberies.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The better the team, the shorter the list. The list, that is, of
what it cannot do.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the season, the Texas Longhorns' ``can't-do'' list was a
long one, and it got longer after a season-opening loss to North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   But now, nearly three months later, the list is short. About the
only thing Texas can't do is win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   With victories over Texas A&AMP;M on Friday, in the Big 12
Championship Game (Dec. 4) and in the Fiesta Bowl (Jan. 1), the
Longhorns could finish the season ranked as high as No. 2 and
surely no worse than No. 3 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Already, national TV and talk-radio personalities are
proclaiming Texas will be next year's preseason No. 1. But the
Longhorns don't want to forget the task at hand. This is a team
that wasn't even ranked after the fourth week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have worked so hard to separate themselves from last
year's team and its magical year, but if last year was a magical
year, then to this point, this season fits in the same category,''
Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``Our motto for the group this week
will be, `Are you satisfied?' We've got to be ready to go forward,
because we've got a lot of special things left that could happen to
our football team if we're good enough and we handle it well
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns (9-2, 6-1 Big 12) appear to have handled their
success quite well, though they'll admit it is something of a
surprise to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us really tried to predict the future before the
season,'' fullback Ricky Brown said. ``To sum it up, I'd say we're
all really excited about where we are now, and we're really happy
about what we've overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we started the season, we set goals to win the Big 12
South and to be Big 12 champs and to not be beaten by any Texas
school, and those goals are what led us to where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have taken on each goal as methodically as they
have crossed out these items on the can't-do list:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1) They can't find a suitable replacement for Heisman
Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they did. After a slow start, Hodges Mitchell has stepped
up and become the man. He is the first back in school history to
rush for more than 1,000 yards and have more than 300 yards in
receptions in a season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2) Texas' offense can't be as potent after losing seven
starters, including a running back (Ricky Williams) and a wide
receiver (Wane McGarity) who had the best seasons in school history
at their respective positions. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it can. The Longhorns are ninth in the country in total
yards with an average of 414.2 per game and are one of only two
Division I-A teams with a 3,000-yard passer, a 1,000-yard rusher
and a 1,000-yard receiver. Texas finished 11th nationally in
offense last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3) Major Applewhite can't be as successful in his second year
as a starter because of the key offensive personnel his team lost. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he can. Applewhite is a finalist for the Davey O'Brien
Award, which is handed out annually to the nation's top
quarterback, and has thrown for more yards (3,132) and touchdowns
(21) this season than any previous Texas quarterback, surpassing
James Brown's 2,468 yards in 1996 and 19 touchdowns in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4) With five new starters, including at tight end, the
Longhorns' offensive line can neither open holes against the strong
run defenses of the Big 12 nor protect Applewhite against the
league's blitzing defenses. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it can. Mitchell has averaged 133.7 yards per game (and 5.6
yards per carry) in Big 12 play. Save for one disastrous afternoon
against Kansas State when it allowed the Wildcats to torture
Applewhite, the offensive line has kept him off his back, allowing
19 sacks overall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5) The Longhorns can't be consistent, because they are too
young. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they can. Despite beginning the year with 23 freshmen and
sophomores on their two-deep roster, the Longhorns have avoided the
roller-coaster season that has plagued much of the rest of the
conference, putting together four- and five-game win streaks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6) The Longhorns' defense can't make up for the loss of
emotional leader Dusty Renfro at middle linebacker. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire. Though Brown says this defense is the quietest he
has ever coached, it obviously has done its talking on the field.
Texas is sixth in the country in defense, and should it finish
there, this would be its best showing since 1991, when the
Longhorns finished third in the nation in yards allowed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Wide receiver Kwame Cavil can't be an effective go-to guy,
because with the loss of Williams and McGarity, defenses will focus
on him. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Forget that. Cavil has established school and conference
single-season reception marks with 85 catches. And with his 1,016
yards, he is only 72 yards from setting a UT yardage mark as well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. Texas can't beat Nebraska for a third consecutive time. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? The Longhorns fought off the Cornhuskers 24-20 on
Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. Texas can't win the Big 12 South.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Wrong again. The Longhorns have clinched the division and can
win it by two full games with one more win.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. The Longhorns can't win the Big 12 South, because they
can't win at Kyle Field in the regular-season finale. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nine down, one to go. The final tally comes this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Winning the Big 12) was one of the goals we had as a team
this year and every year,'' safety Greg Brown said. ``The only
problem is that we are in the same position that A&AMP;M was last year.
They overlooked us, and we can't overlook them. There is no coming
back to Austin if we lose to A&AMP;M.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
One day after his football team won its seventh game of the season,
University of Houston head coach Kim Helton was finished as the
Cougars' coach. A source close to the school's athletic program
confirmed Sunday night that Helton will not return for the final
two years on his contract.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helton, who will receive the remaining $600,000 due on his
contract, ends his seven seasons as UH coach with a 24-53-1 record.
The Cougars finished the regular season with wins over Tulane, LSU
and Army and are eligible for their first bowl since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Helton nor athletic director Chet Gladchuk was available
for comment Sunday night. An official announcement of Helton's
departure is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as a shock to one of Helton's assistant coaches,
who noted the staff had Sunday off after returning late Saturday
from West Point, N.Y., and was due to meet this morning to discuss
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 26-14 win over Army, Helton had predicted,
``We're going to have a great recruiting year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars finished sixth in the final Conference USA standings
with a 3-3 league record, having dropped out of championship
contention with losses to Alabama-Birmingham and East Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth of four C-USA teams that are eligible for bowl trips,
UH was hoping Louisville would find a spot outside the conference's
three tie-ins, thus leaving a spot for the Cougars in the third
C-USA bowl, the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is now unclear whether the Cougars would accept such
an invitation since they would then be in the midst of a coaching
search. It also is unclear if Gladchuk asked for Helton's
resignation Sunday and was refused, leading to the coach's
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive 3-8 seasons following a share of the first C-USA
championship in 1996 led to rising criticism of Helton, 51, whose
team was 2-9 in 1995. Prior to this season, he hired new
coordinators _ Dick Bumpas on defense and Les Koenning Jr. on
offense _ and the changes seemed to produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Ketric Sanford set school career records for
rushing yards, all-purpose yards and rushing TDs during the season,
and the rushing offense ranked 17th nationally going into the Army
game. The defense was 14th against the run, 26th overall and 25th
against scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But following a sellout of nearly 32,000 at newly renovated
Robertson Stadium for the season opener with Rice, Gladchuk had to
wrestle with an apparent decline in interest in the football
program.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rice game, attendance dwindled markedly for the
remaining four home games, and UH ended with an average of
approximately 20,000 for the season, based on announced figures.
That apathy could not have been encouraging in regard to selling
season tickets and raising private contributions badly needed for
next season.

CRIME RATE IN NEW YORK CITY FELL 8 PERCENT IN EARLY `99 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite an uptick in the homicide rate, New York
City's overall crime rate fell by 8 percent during the first six
months of the year, compared with the same period last year,
according to preliminary figures released on Sunday by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The drop showed New York City slightly behind the national
decrease of about 10 percent in the overall crime rate. Both New
York City and the nation showed an 8 percent drop in violent crimes
_ homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The city showed a sharper drop in crime than the average for the
seven other cities with populations of more than one million
people. The rate for violent crimes and for crimes over all for all
eight big cities, including New York, fell by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Within the metropolitan region, however, New York City's smaller
neighbors tended to show steeper drops in crime than New York City
did, an analysis of the FBI's figures showed.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 cities in the New York region with populations over
100,000, taken as a whole, showed a 15 percent drop in the violent
crime rate, compared with New York City's 8 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   During the first sixth months of last year, New York City was
the sixth-least-violent city in the region. This year it was
seventh, after Hartford, Conn., which saw a 23 percent drop in
violent crimes during the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Blumstein, a professor of urban systems and operations
research at Carnegie Mellon University, said that the steeper
decreases in the cities surrounding New York could be a sign that
New York City is reaching the point of diminishing returns in its
remarkably successful battle against crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that New York City was one of the first places where the
decline started, and where it has been particularly steep,''
Blumstein said, ``it has got to, at some point, level off.''
</P>
<P>
   Homicides in New York City jumped 14 percent during the first
half of this year, to 341 from 299. In the 11 cities outside New
York for which the FBI released statistics, homicides also
increased, about 12 percent, to 100 from 89.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 cities in the region for which statistics were available
were Albany and Yonkers, N.Y.; Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth and
Paterson, N.J.; and Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, Stamford and
Waterbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Of those cities, New Haven had the highest overall crime rate
and Newark the highest violent crime rate. Stamford had the lowest
violent crime rate, while Yonkers had the lowest crime rate over
all.
</P>
<P>
   New York City had the third lowest overall crime rate in the
region, after Yonkers and Stamford.

By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From north of the border came the traveling
high-wire act _ Ringling Bros., Carter and McGrady Circus _ and the
Los Angeles Lakers couldn't tell whether to watch and marvel at the
gravity-defying acts or stop them.
</P>
<P>
   But this three-ring show apparently has no limits, and even a
circus tent can't cover Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady and their
Toronto Raptors co-stars when all are firing in sync. That's
exactly what happened Sunday night at Staples Center, and the
Lakers are probably still oohing and ahhing a bit at the results,
even if those exclamations are just expressions of the pain of a
111-102 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put on a good show. It was the Vince Show tonight,'' said
Lakers guard Ron Harper, one of Carter's many foils on a 34-point
night. ``They have a very fine team over there, young players who
can jump out of the gym. . . . We don't have athletes that can jump
that high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean shoot, I'm 35. I don't jump that high anymore,'' Harper
said. ``Maybe when I was 17, I could jump that high and hang
around. But they've got some athletes that can jump out the gym and
anytime you got them kind of guys, we're in for a long year.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Shaquille O'Neal noted of Carter: ``Half man, half
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the first time this season, the Lakers really missed
Kobe Bryant, their only truly athletic presence. Fortunately for
them, no NBA team has the same combination of weapons as the
Raptors, and thankfully, they reside in the East.
</P>
<P>
   When Carter wasn't floating above the cylinder, he was giving
way to Toronto's other weapons _ from the athletic McGrady (12
points), to the bruising Antonio Davis (13 points, 10 rebounds) to
the veteran shooting savvy of Dee Brown (15 points) and Dell Curry
13 points).
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the Lakers just don't have the right bodies to match
that arsenal. Derek Fisher thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we were playing against Jesus,'' he said.
``They played well. And they made shots. But they didn't have
anyone that couldn't be guarded or couldn't be contained with the
proper defense. We didn't get stops when we had to. It's not
anything that can't be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Easiest solution? Don't play the Raptors. Or get Bryant healthy
before the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mismatches, the Lakers stayed close on the strength
of O'Neal's 37 points and 19 rebounds and a 29-point performance
from Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Harper added 15 points, but the Lakers were a three-man show. No
one else contributed. Coach Phil Jackson even started Rick Fox over
A.C. Green in the second half to put another shooter on the floor,
but Fox came up firing blanks _ 1 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't had a consistent bench performance,'' Jackson
said. ``Their bench beat us tonight basically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed almost continuously from the first quarter
on, and their last lead came late in the third quarter, 76-74. But
the Raptors, despite having Carter hobbled from a midair collision
with O'Neal, regained control, took a 2-point lead into the fourth,
then used a 16-2 run _ and eight straight points from Curry _ to
pull away again 95-83.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers rode a late surge on the shooting of Harper and Brian
Shaw to make it a game once more. Harper's layup with just under 2
minutes left pulled the Lakers within three points, 102-99, but
that's as close as it got.
</P>
<P>
   Carter hit a jumper and Brown nailed his fourth 3-pointer of the
game to extend the Raptors' lead to 107-99 with 1:06 left. Rice hit
a 3-pointer, but Shaw missed a 3 moments later and Toronto came up
with the loose ball to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got in a point in the game where we just couldn't stop
them,'' Jackson said. ``That was one of our problems tonight, was
our defense, and we couldn't seem to ever solve the personnel. When
we did take the lead, they just continued to score and we just
couldn't match that pace. . . . We just didn't match the intensity
of the game when it came down to a critical point where we just got
the game back within four points in the 90s.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The script changed in the final act. The
fourth-quarter collapses have been rewritten. The stars are
different.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the final scene remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   As if to torment themselves, the Rockets refuse to go quietly.
They rallied and tested the Sacramento Kings on Sunday night as
they could not down the stretch at Compaq Center. But again the
sound and fury amounted to nothing. The scene-stealer wore another
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Kings guard Jason Williams nailed Sunday's game-breaker to beat
the Rockets 110-105 and send them home 2-10 with their second
five-game losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this,'' guard Shandon Anderson said. ``We can
find a way to get over the hump, and we always fall short. We're
close and close and close. The games are so close, but in the
fourth quarter we never seem to execute like teams that have been
together like Sacramento and Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   And Seattle. And Indiana. And even Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Rockets lack that keeps victory beyond their
reach, Charles Barkley said: ``We're missing a lot. We're just not
very good. We're still making the same mistakes we made in the
first game, the same mistakes we made in the preseason. Jason made
big shots. But until we accept the challenge, we're going to
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had their chances, as usual. Playing the second of a
road back-to-back, they were outmanned inside. Kelvin Cato sat out
with a sore right knee. Tony Massenburg was out with a stomach flu.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings shot well, making 48.5 percent. But they held off the
Rockets in large part by controlling the boards, scoring 18
second-chance points, including seven in the last seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard in a back-to-back situation short-handed,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``They wore us out on the
boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rockets had a last-minute chance. The Kings _ 7-1 for
their best start since they were the Rochester Royals in 1952-53 _
had been pulling away as if following the familiar script.
Averaging 5.1 points per game, Scot Pollard came off the bench for
a season-high 12 points. His dunk on a perfect pick-and-roll caught
Hakeem Olajuwon high in the lane, putting the Kings up by seven
with 2:15 left.
</P>
<P>
   On their next time down the court, the Rockets could not get a
shot before Olajuwon had to rush a long jumper to beat the shot
clock, putting the Kings in position to put them away. But Williams
quickly missed a 3, and Steve Francis was fouled. His free throw
cut the lead to six. And after a Jon Barry turnover, Francis nailed
a 3 to move the Rockets to within 106-103 with 52.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But after running the shot clock down to its last few ticks,
Williams drove hard to his right and fired a 23-footer over Bryce
Drew, his swish pushing the lead to five.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished with 25 points, 12 assists and six rebounds.
He left Arco Arena without comment, though Kings coach Rick Adelman
said, ``Jason was really good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets were ready to sing his praises, and their
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game, it seems like we're in it,'' Francis said. ``Every
time we play better. Then with the clock running down, someone
throws something up and it goes. He wasn't even facing the
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets still had a chance. Francis followed an Olajuwon
miss with a rebound and layup to cut the lead to 108-105 with 9.6
seconds left. Forced to foul, the Rockets sent Darrick Martin to
the line. He nailed both free throws with eight seconds left to ice
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed all right,'' Barkley said. ``We just can't stop
anybody when we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets seemed a few stops short all night. They trailed by
12 in the first half and rallied back to a lead. They trailed by 12
again in the third quarter and came back to within shots of the
lead. The Rockets pulled to within one when Francis broke free for
a slam and Olajuwon, who had 20 points and 15 rebounds, completed a
break and a 9-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two minutes left in the quarter, the Rockets were
within two. They even had an open 3 for the lead. But Walt Williams
missed everything and Francis had turnovers on three possessions to
end the quarter with the Kings leading by six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned it over too many times,'' Francis said after
finishing with 21 points but eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets quickly moved to within a field goal again. Barkley
(19 points) hit a short jumper, then passed to Francis for another
dunk. Even in the fourth quarter, they only briefly fell back by as
many as six before rushing back. But the game came down to a final
few possessions, and the game-deciding shot was on the wrong end of
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung in there, but it's the same story _ just not enough,''
Tomjanovich said. ``We were bad when we first started. Before we
became the Rockets that won championships, we lost seven in a row
and were completely blown out. We're competitive, but whatever that
little extra is ''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it is missing.

KEYES, FORBES, HATCH, MCCAIN ASSAIL BUSH AT GOP DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES AND CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Arizona _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush skipped his third
nationally televised debate on Sunday, and this time he may have
had reason to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of slugging away at each other, the four GOP
presidential contenders hammered away at Bush, with some saying he
is more interested in raising money for his campaign than in facing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this campaign is about talking to George W.
Bush,'' said conservative talk-show host Alan Keyes when asked what
he would say to Bush if the candidate were present. ``He doesn't
want to talk to anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of about 2,000 at Arizona State University in
Tempe, near Phoenix, the candidates sparred on questions ranging
from Russian attacks on Chechnya to gun control and
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The debate drew four of the six remaining GOP presidential
candidates _ publisher Steve Forbes, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, former
U.S. diplomat Keyes and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Missing were
conservative activist Gary Bauer and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was sponsored by the Arizona Republican Party and
telecast live by C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   It was Forbes who took the most shots at Bush, critiquing the
Texas governor's recent foreign-policy speech and suggesting Bush
is obsessed with raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to life than fund-raisers,'' Forbes said. ``When
you address a question to George W. Bush, you rarely get an answer.
You get something that came off a TelePrompTer or that his tutors
just gave him.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes painted Bush as a puppet, someone who, ``if you put the
words into his mouth, he would be a perfect press secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, who has long said he would not attend
Sunday's debate, called the attacks on Bush ``uncalled for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The comments made by other candidates disparaging Governor
Bush's absence tonight were out of line and all uncalled for,''
said Mike Hull, Bush's Arizona campaign director, in a statement
released after the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush will be participating in three debates during
the first half of December, including one in Arizona on December
6,'' Hull added.
</P>
<P>
   McCain found himself under fire during the debate when Hatch
lashed out at the Arizonan's campaign-finance proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, give me a break,'' Hatch said testily after McCain praised
his own bill, so far unsuccessful, to limit unregulated campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain's bill passed, we wouldn't have a Republican Party
two years later,'' Hatch said. Republicans have historically relied
on so-called soft-money donations from corporations while Democrats
get help from unions in the form of independent-expenditure
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the portion of the debate devoted to foreign policy, Forbes
hit Bush again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that George W. Bush, in his speech on
China, did not take a forthright attitude on human-rights abuses,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain accused the Clinton administration of conducting a
``feckless, photo-op'' foreign policy and lacerated the president
for his policies on Kosovo. McCain said Kosovo was a military
action that was poll-driven and ``conducted in the most immoral
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates differed slightly on their approaches to gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued that some gun-control measures are legitimate, but
he said other social reforms are also necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I took every weapon in Arizona and dumped them into the
Gulf of Mexico, I could still take you to a Web site that teaches
children how to build a pipe bomb,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who said the focus of his platform is pulling America out
of its ``moral crisis,'' said, ``The answer is not gun control but
self-control.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, about 100 McCain supporters wearing shirts emblazoned
with the American flag crowded around the senator and his wife,
Cindy, as they edged into the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller group of Forbes backers appeared in orange T-shirts to
rally for their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harper, 17, of Phoenix, who wants to attend the Naval
Academy, as McCain did, said he supports the senator because ``he
is an honorable man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is a very basic-type politician with sound values and
character instead of flamboyance,'' said James Collins, 46, of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he was ``discouraged'' that Bush decided not to
attend the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think taking this for granted is an insult to the people he
expects to vote for him,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with several campaigns said the debate marks the
beginning of an intense battle to win Arizona's early Feb. 22
primary.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore that point, Forbes will begin airing a
television ad on Tuesday highlighting his position on Social
Security and targeting the older voters whom the candidate sees as
crucial to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McCain will begin a two-day campaign swing through the
state, and Bush, who has said he will attend the Dec. 6 debate,
will send his wife, Laura, to Phoenix for several campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' campaign chairman, Bill Dal Col, said Arizona has become
even more important than it was in 1996, as the nation waits to see
whether McCain can manage a victory in his home state. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Cowboys couldn't hold on to a 17-point lead in
Minnesota, a 14-point lead in Indianapolis or a seven-point lead in
Philadelphia, so it was not surprising that a seven-point lead
wouldn't be enough in Arizona.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they had in eight of their previous nine games this season,
the Cowboys led at halftime Sunday. And as has happened five times
this season, they were outplayed in the second half as the
Cardinals rallied for a 13-9 victory in front of 72,015 at Sun
Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the Cowboys (5-5) into a tie with the Giants for
second place behind Washington (6-4) in the NFC East. With
back-to-back wins, the Cardinals are 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, there is no constant theme,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said. ``If there was, I'd try to solve it. We are just not getting
execution in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had their opportunities. There was a third-and-one
they couldn't convert, followed by a fourth-and-one that was
stymied late in the fourth quarter. There was a final drive that
stalled just 22 yards from victory. There was a touchdown called
back. There was a field goal taken off the scoreboard because of a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough right now,'' Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said.
``We've got veterans that have won Super Bowls. To come out and not
play the way we're capable of playing, a lot of guys are hurt right
now. And it's not just this game. It's three or four games that
have really hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just mention Philadelphia or New York, and the Cowboys cringe.
Throw in Indianapolis and Minnesota, and it turns into more of a
shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same kind of loss,'' Woodson said. ``You know you're
better than the other team, and it's frustrating. Very frustrating.
We have a lot of veterans who just can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   There were penalties that came back to haunt and Arizona
defensive stands that hurt, the most notable on a late
fourth-quarter drive that stalled at the Cardinals' nine-yard line.
Emmitt Smith went up the middle on third-and-one but was stuffed
for no gain. The Cowboys went for it on fourth down, again giving
the ball to Smith, who attempted to get through on the right side.
He was met at the line by Kwamie Lassiter and Ronald McKinnon,
again falling inches short of the first-down marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mile,'' Smith said in describing how long that yard felt.
``It's frustrating as I don't know what to be out there, and
everybody's fighting and doing whatever it takes to win, and not
come away with a victory. Especially to be down there 10, 12 yards
from the goal and not make a first down. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys got another chance after Deion Sanders'
31-yard return of a free kick with 1:41 to play. Backup quarterback
Jason Garrett, starting again for Troy Aikman, threw three
consecutive short passes, then Chris Warren carried five yards to
earn a first down. After three more short pass attempts but only
one completion, the Cowboys faced fourth-and-three at the Arizona
22. Garrett connected with Rocket Ismail, but he was stuffed just
beyond the line for a gain of only one.
</P>
<P>
   There were no final stabs at the end zone, but that's largely
because of what the defense was showing, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing short zones, and what I think you have to do
in those situations is throw the ball underneath and give your guys
a chance to catch it and run with it and get a little something
going,'' Garrett said. ``They were pretty consistent with that.
They played it well. It was an excellent call on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only in the second half that the Cowboys missed
chances. There was a touchdown nullified by a delay-of-game penalty
in the second quarter. On second-and-10 from the Arizona 26,
Garrett connected with Ernie Mills in the corner of the end zone.
At the time, Dallas was clinging to a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was even aware the play was late, and according to
Garrett no whistle ever blew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty aware of the clock,'' he said. ``We had a shift
and movement on that, and it was obviously one that was coming down
to the wire. I thought I got the ball off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could have salvaged three points out of the drive
when Richie Cunningham successfully booted a 38-yard field goal.
Those points were wiped off, however, thanks to a holding penalty
by fullback Robert Thomas. The ball was moved back 10 yards, and
Cunningham attempted a 48-yarder. That one went wide left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not good enough right now to lose scoring
opportunities,'' Gailey said. ``We have to take advantage of every
one of those. That did hurt. It hurt enough to lose the ballgame,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' only touchdown came courtesy of the ground attack.
On their second possession of the game, Smith, Ismail and Chris
Warren combined to run the ball on seven consecutive plays, driving
Dallas from its 19 to the Arizona 17. After a 10-yard holding
penalty, Garrett connected with Mills for 16 yards, then hit David
LaFleur with an 11-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 Cowboys lead with
58 seconds remaining in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But as in their other losses this season, when they got to the
second half, the Cowboys stopped doing what they do best. Smith,
running with a padded glove to protect his broken right hand, had
racked up 83 yards on 18 carries by halftime. He carried only twice
in the third quarter as the Cowboys ran seven passing plays
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to question,'' Smith said when asked why the
Cowboys seemingly abandoned their ground game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' first scoring opportunity came late in the first
half when they pinned the Cowboys deep in their own territory, then
took possession at the Dallas 37. The Cowboys held them to a
24-yard field goal by Chris Jacke, who later added a 38-yarder
early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The only Arizona touchdown came on the first drive of the second
half as Rob Moore escaped Sanders and George Teague to score from
21 yards out on a flea-flicker pass from Dave Brown. It capped a
four-play, 69-yard drive, the Cardinals' longest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' only other points came on a safety that was
deliberately allowed by the Cardinals late in the fourth quarter
when two points weren't going to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players have been in the position we were in so many times
in the last four years. I don't think they panicked at halftime,''
Arizona coach Vince Tobin said. ``They realized here was a football
team that was very beatable today.''
</P>
<P>
   And beatable every time they venture outside of Texas Stadium,
it would seem. The Cowboys have won only one game outside Texas
this year, that being the season opener in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, you have to be a good road team to be a Super
Bowl team,'' Woodson said. ``I know in '92 and '93, we won a lot of
road games. We dominated on the road. Right now, we're not playing
that way. We haven't played like that in the last two or three
years. We're just not a good road team right now.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT has come to this. After the Nets lost another game Saturday
night, mercifully keeping them to the rear of the Rockets in the
NBA standings, Stephon Marbury's mother sternly berated her
offspring within earshot of lingering media types.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase, Mom was telling Stephon to get his head up and
stop acting like the bunch of losers with whom he shares a locker
room. Noticing the eavesdroppers and their poised notebooks, she
turned and redirected her lecture: ``This team is burning (my son)
out and I don't want my son burned out. Write that!''
</P>
<P>
   You bet they did. When Mother speaks, you listen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's a place for her in David Stern's office because
the entire league, not just the sorry-as-ever Nets, needs a
tongue-lashing. Besides admonishing the multimillionaire players
for not caring, she could get in the megamillionaire owners' faces
for their predictably shameless avarice, not to mention for
delivering unto the increasingly apathetic/fed-up public a product
that's 75 percent packaging and 25 percent substance.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been to Compaq Center since the Rockets' hellbound
season began, you know what I'm talking about. All the
bells-and-whistles theatrics ring hollow _ it's almost silly,
really _ with so many empty seats and such desultory play on the
floor. Even Turbo's trampoline dunks elicit mostly been-there,
seen-that yawns.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, not the sideshow, must carry the night. And at
present their games wouldn't be decent value for half of what you
pay to watch them.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston isn't a glaring exception to the norm in the NBA to
date. Fan-tastic? Phooey. While quality plummets, costs soar.
Ticket prices, on average, are up close to 14 percent around the
league. It requires nearly $270 to drag a family of four to a game,
if you factor in minimal purchases at the concession stand plus a
couple of souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the NBA, good grief, is intended for families anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But suckers are no longer born every minute, in Houston or
elsewhere. The Rockets' drop in attendance _ after 176 consecutive
sellouts, they are 2-for-6 so far _ has been mirrored league-wide.
Except for the four teams playing in new arenas plus Minnesota and
Sacramento, whose figures are padded by humongous gates in Tokyo,
only two franchises have managed what could be considered
meaningful increases.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason Cleveland is up 11.5 percent, and 10-1 Portland,
for obvious reasons, is up 10.4 percent. But the most amazing
number is that the Bulls are down just 1.1 percent. Apparently, a
candle burns in the United Center window for M.J.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a candle should burn in every arena for Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it's the Jordan effect continuing,'' suggests
Brandon Steiner, a sports marketing specialist in New York. ``You
have to have a couple must-see guys to fuel the league, and you
don't have that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 1,000 tickets fewer per game are being sold
around the league if the aberrant statistics are discounted. Were
the trend to continue through the end of the season, such a decline
would result in about $2 million less in revenues per club. After
two decades of continuous growth, the post-lockout NBA is facing
back-to-back attendance drops for the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their world championship, the Spurs have shown a
14.5-percent decrease. Boston shows promise and plays an exciting
style, yet the FleetCenter has been 11 percent emptier than a year
ago. Seven teams are down at least 10 percent, led by the Nets'
drop of nearly 20 percent. Although Atlanta, ensconced in a new
palace, is up 13 percent, 5,500 seats went unsold with faceless
Orlando in town on a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Could Hawks fans possibly be less than enthralled with the
uplifting presence of Isaiah Rider in their midst?
</P>
<P>
   Could Leslie Alexander actually be interested in trading for
Rider? We hear rumors. Boy, that would fire up you folks and make
you want to drag the kiddies down to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Clippers have realized
a whopping 65-percent increase after moving into the Staples Center
with the Lakers, but they average about 7,000 under capacity. The
glamour-puss Lakers have realized an 11-percent gain with the new
digs and a gaudy coaching hire in Phil Jackson, but they are close
to 1,000 empty seats shy of being SRO.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, of course, professes a haughty disregard for the
evidence presented here and, for the record, insists there's
nothing to be concerned about, not in the least. Nero lives in the
smug personage of the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Stern could use a stern talking-to from Stephon's mother.

TECHNOLOGY CHANGES TONE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Moose-crossing signs still line the freeways that
roll through densely wooded mountains and hardscrabble farmland.
But developments along the information superhighway are giving this
tiny rural state a new identify.
</P>
<P>
   From the picturesque hamlets surrounding Nashua to the
colonial-era shipyards of Portsmouth, New Hampshire is going high
tech. The decade that began with closed mills, high unemployment
and economic stagnation is ending on an e-economy high.
</P>
<P>
   As the national political spotlight returns to the
first-in-the-nation primary state for its quadrennial presidential
sweepstakes, it will shine on an electorate that has been basking
in the prosperity of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to seeing our snow-covered villages and general
stores,'' New Hampshire Governor Jeanne .Shaheen recently boasted
to a group of visitors, ``you will see a state with the highest
percentage of high-tech workers in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer necessary for candidates to feel New
Hampshirites' pain, as Bill Clinton tried so hard to do in 1991.
Pat Buchanan's angry pitch to disenchanted ``peasants with
pitchforks'' no longer resonates as it did when he won the GOP
primary in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those messages have been replaced by more upbeat appeals for
improving education and health care, getting money out of politics,
and an unabashed pitch to the state's technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not hearing those hard-core conservative views coming
out here. Even Buchanan has toned down his rhetoric,'' noted
Concord-based Republican campaign strategist Chip Griffin. ``High
tech is really shifting the demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech boom is most evident in the more densely populated
southern part of the state. Attracted by New Hampshire's proximity
to mountains and the ocean, affordable housing (starter houses are
easily found for $200,000) and the lack of a state income tax,
skilled workers are moving in from congested border communities in
nearby Massachusetts as well as from the Midwest and California.
</P>
<P>
   Firms specializing in defense electronics, instrumentation,
e-commerce and emerging software have clustered along the
Interstate-93 corridor from Nashua to Manchester, and near coastal
communities such as Portsmouth. The 18-mile stretch of New
Hampshire's oceanfront often is referred to as the ``e-coast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are moving for the quality of life,'' said Jan
Schneider, a software consultant who used to travel to Boston to
find clients but now has plenty of business close to her New
Hampshire home.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton first ran for president, the state of 1.2 million
people had lost about 59,000 jobs and was in the depths of a
recession. Eight years later, the state has regained those jobs and
added an additional 33,000, according to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,000 software companies in the state. The
concentration of high-tech workers is three times higher than the
national average. Venture capital is readily available.
Unemployment is close to 2 percent, and the poverty rate is the
nation's lowest.
</P>
<P>
   There is still evidence of the state's famed conservative and
fiercely libertarian character. The Manchester Union Leader, the
state's largest paper, prints a daily prayer _ and occasionally its
conservative editorials _ on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   The state is 97 percent white and overwhelmingly Protestant. One
of its senators, Bob Smith, recently quit the Republican Party
after accusing leaders of abandoning their conservative principles.
When Smith returned to the party several months later, some New
Hampshirites congratulated him for having taught the party a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the changes are unmistakable. There are now as
many registered independents as Republicans. Shaheen, a Democrat,
was elected the state's first female governor three years ago, and
she has signed measures prohibiting discrimination against gays and
permitting gay adoption. In the name of better schools, the state
Legislature came close last month to enacting what once had been
considered the ultimate New Hampshire taboo _ a state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the economy of the state and the profile of the
state has changed in the past 10 years,'' Shaheen said in an
interview. ``And that has an effect on everything from the jobs in
the state to growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Demographic changes in a place with a population scarcely larger
than Santa Clara County would not be of national consequence were
it not for its February 1 primary, which gives the state a
disproportionate influence. Here, where only one president has been
elected in the past half century without first winning the primary
(Bill Clinton in 1992), every development is magnified.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the strong independent vote
favors Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican John McCain. Although
none of the leading candidates holds a big advantage on tech
issues, Bradley and McCain both have exhibited strength among
nonaffiliated voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both impress me as least susceptible to campaign slush
money'' said software entrepreneur David Hallenbeck, a registered
independent and transplant from the Midwest. ``After the past few
years in Washington, they seem refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallenbeck is typical of the new breed of New Hampshire voter.
He supports Republicans on many issues but shuns the social
conservatism of candidates like Steve Forbes or Gary Bauer.
Independents are free to vote in either party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth professor James Shoch, who moved to New Hampshire
after spending 20 years in the Bay Area, said the new tech workers
``tend to be much more upscale, better educated and more white
collar'' than the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Added University of New Hampshire business Professor Ross
Gittell: ``These aren't liberals, but they aren't
arch-conservatives either. You're not getting the same people who
live in Berkeley or Cambridge, but it's far more diversified in
terms of the political spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns are doing what they can to take advantage of the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to go after independents as hard as we can,''
said Mike Dennehy, McCain's New England political director. Rather
than dwelling on matters such as job loss and economic assistance,
``the issues that are resonating are campaign finance reform and
health care,'' said Sue Calegari, who is running Bradley's New
Hampshire effort. ``Pat Buchanan was really appealing to people who
were angry. This campaign is very different now that we are in a
strong economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, McCain, who boasts his technology record as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, unabashedly courted
software executives in Nashua. (``Politicians are given to great
hyperbole,'' McCain said, ``but the fact is that what is happening
in America can only be compared to the invention of the printing
press or the industrial revolution. ... I'd like to congratulate
you for being a part of this exciting technology, which is changing
America.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bush has scheduled a New Hampshire ``high-tech day'' for next
month. Gore used a New Hampshire forum to make a significant tech
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It focuses our message on the new economy,'' said Gore
campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway, who noted that the emphasis is
not confined to the southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent campaign swing through a remote corner of this
wooded state, Vice President Al Gore sat in a living room with a
dozen New Hampshirites in the timber town of Berlin (motto: ``The
Town That Trees Built'').
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely moose country,'' Hattaway recalled. ``This
was a part of the state that has not benefited as much from the
economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was the top concern in moose country? A high-speed
Internet hookup, of course.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP hate for Clinton doomed 106th Congress
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first session of the 106th Congress is petered out in vague
ignominy and ill grace, having fussed much and accomplished little.
But it did do this: It set a new standard for surly partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Congress first wasted months of its time and the nation's
persisting in an impeachment that was obviously doomed from the
first gavel fall, all over a president's attempt to dance _ and
when that wasn't working, to lie _ his way out of admitting to an
affair that didn't even have stylishness to commend it to public
prurience.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to punish President Clinton for besting them, Congress's
Republican leaders spent the rest of the year harrying even his
smallest initiatives and pestering his conduct of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Congress didn't do: It didn't square Social Security
away for the long run. It didn't reform political campaign funding.
It didn't help Medicare seniors cover prescription costs. All three
options were on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it did do: It put anti-environmental riders on just
about every passing piece of legislation. (Clinton used vetoes and
veto threats to unhorse most.) It kited a nearly $800 billion tax
cut that would have overwhelmingly gone to our richest. (The public
yawned. The plan flopped.) It bored new tax loopholes for
big-business political contributors. (See above, ``Campaign funding
reform, failure of.'') And rather than just scraping out-dated
spending caps, it resorted to goofy budget dodges so it could
tender at least meager new support for education, teaching
hospitals and economic development in down-and-out neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The session was mainly marked by the palpable Republican hatred
of Clinton, understandable not because the president is the
scoundrel Republicans insist he is _ mostly he's not _ but because
he has used his superior political skills to put them in one after
another box and to eke out small victories for his own program.
More teachers and cops here, a plan there to protect at least
patches of greenery from development.
</P>
<P>
   Expect nothing better next year. The GOP majorities remain too
thin to dominate. Clinton, facing a no-win game on the Hill, will
concentrate on foreign policy, where he has some maneuvering room.
Both parties will ballyhoo high-profile legislation meant only to
create bugle-call issues for the election. The big, totemistic
Republican initiatives won't survive Clinton's veto. The Democratic
ones won't get out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the nation can expect improvement after that is up to
voters. In one of history's longest-running practical jokes, voters
in the 1980s elected a Republican presidency and Democratic
Congresses; in the '90s, a Democratic presidency and Republican
Congresses.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest bloc was neither Democratic or Republican. It
was no-shows. Nothing in the politics of the two decades enticed
them to polls. Maybe disgust finally will. It should. If so, this
year's Congress can claim a lot of the credit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; MISTLER'S EXIT &LR;  By Louis Begley. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12. In
this dark novel by an author long preoccupied by the falsification
of the self, a rich executive who can't, or won't, separate his
truth from his lies escapes to Venice after learning he has
terminal cancer. ``The theme of self-deception at the end of life
... may be the supreme test for a novelist with this of all
obsessions,'' Jack Miles wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1998. ```Mistler's Exit' meets the test.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TIME OF OUR TIME &LR;  By Norman Mailer. Modern Library, $24.95.
Not surprisingly, this bulky retrospective of Mailer's work since
he kicked things off in 1948 with ``The Naked and the Dead'' shrugs
off conventional literary form; instead of organizing the
selections chronologically or thematically, the author arranges
them based on the period they describe. The resulting grab bag of
hits and misses is ``that rarity, an anthology that can be read
straight through,'' James Shapiro wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year. ``Its neatly interwoven sections collectively
tell a story of their own, a social history of postwar America, at
the heart of which is Mailer's own tangled love affair with this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BREAKFAST ON PLUTO &LR;  By Patrick McCabe. HarperPerennial, $13.
Patrick ``Pussy'' Braden is an effusively cheerful Irish
transvestite with a temper, looking for love in a London paralyzed
by IRA bombings during the swinging '70s. This novel by ``a master
of the literary macabre'' may be ``the most successful book yet to
be born'' out of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Courtney Weaver
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE WHEREABOUTS OF ENEAS McNULTY &LR; , by Sebastian Barry
(Penguin, $12.95), a patriotic out-of-work Irishman joins the Royal
Irish Constabulary after World War I and finds himself marked for
death by his boyhood friend, an enforcer for the IRA. Throughout
his hero's travails, ``Barry's sweet, lyrical pitch never
falters,'' Aoibheann Sweeney wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1933-1941 &LR;  By
Victor Klemperer. Modern Library, $14.95. In this intensely German
insider account of the Nazi tyranny, a Jewish-born Protestant
professor tells of Hitler's escalating persecution of the Jews and
of the many episodes of cruelty, cowardice and decency he
encountered in his daily life. The result is ``a fascinating
self-portrait and an equally fascinating portrait of a regime whose
consequences haunt the world to this day,'' Peter Gay wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; OFFICIAL SECRETS: What the Nazis Planned, What the British
and Americans Knew &LR; , by Richard Breitman (Hill &AMP; Wang, $13), a
history professor argues that the British government knew more
about the Holocaust than they let on. Breitman ``weaves solid new
scholarship into a gripping narrative that reveals a startling
nonchalance in facing evil,'' Peter Grose wrote earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MACHINE DREAMS &LR;  By Jayne Anne Phillips. Vintage Contemporaries,
$14. The author's first novel explores the private legends of a
small-town American family, as expressed by each of its members.
The shocking moments arise from small, ordinary ones. In 1984 the
reviewer Anne Tyler called Phillips ``an assured and gifted
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WIDOW'S CHILDREN &LR;  By Paula Fox. Norton, $13. The widow in
this novel dies in a nursing home while her middle-aged children,
only one of whom learns of her death, are holding a family reunion
of sorts in which feelings of resentment and hostility boil over.
In 1976, Norma Rosen admired Fox's ``special brand of unemphatic,
perceptively detailed writing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLIND MAN'S BLUFF: The Untold Story of American Submarine
Espionage &LR;  By Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, with Annette
Lawrence Drew. HarperPaperbacks, $7.99. Sontag is an investigative
journalist, Christopher Drew is a reporter at The New York Times,
and Annette Lawrence Drew is a researcher. Together hey explore the
history of underwater spying during the Cold War. In 1998 the
reviewer Timothy Naftali called this an ``important look'' at one
of the ``most harrowing battlefields of the superpower conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPALACHIA &LR;  By Charles Wright. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet's 13th volume reveals a yearning
for mystical or religious transcendence. Earlier this year the
reviewer Adam Kirsch called Wright's self-reflective, questioning
verse ``a significant and true reflection of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPEN MINDED: Working Out the Logic of the Soul &LR;  By Jonathan
Lear. Harvard University, $15.95. A psychoanalyst and philosopher
issues a defense of Freud, arguing that democratic societies need
Freudian insights to comprehend the dark side of the psyche in
order to make the best-informed choices. The result is ``a
remarkable book _ highly articulate, learned, thoughtful and
fresh,'' Mark Edmundson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ACHESON: The Secretary of State Who Created the American World &LR; 
By James Chace. Harvard University, $17.95. This biography portrays
Dean Acheson, the secretary of state from 1949 to 1953, as a
visionary public servant who laid the groundwork for today's
international order. Last year the reviewer Francis Fukuyama found
the book to be ``engrossingly good reading.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 21, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds POLLING-APATHY-REVIEW, plus graphics
notes on three other stories.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russia's brutal effort to
subdue runaway Chechnya is messily wiping out civilians and
soldiers alike, drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation,
working quite well, thank you. Americans cannot truly imagine
Russians' frustration at their imperial disintegration and economic
collapse. But perhaps they can get a sense of the emotional release
that Chechnya evokes among Russians by recalling how good it felt,
after two decades of Vietnam, Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to
finally regain their military prowess by striking back first at
Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then, far more dramatically, against
Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991. By Michael Wines. WITH GRAPHIC.
(Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   POLLING-RELIABILITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Most politicians'
vigilant reliance on poll numbers raises an important but
seldom-asked public policy question: Who actually talks to
pollsters and who does not? The answer, it turns out, is troubling
news for the polling industry and the people who rely on the
numbers: Far fewer people agree to participate in surveys than just
10 years ago, a fact that some critics call the industry's dirty
little secret, because most polling firms refuse to divulge their
surveys' refusal rates. By Don Van Natta. (Moved in the `a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   With sidebar:
</P>
<P>
   POLLING-APATHY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Is the public really paying
attention to politics and various issues on which polls focus? Many
experts warn that Americans are growing increasingly detached from
the political process in more fundamental ways. By Robin Toner.
(Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE-JUSTICE-REVIEW (Pontiac, Mich.) _ Many psychologists
and sociologists nowadays worry that boys are growing up too fast
these days. Boys are increasingly dressing like adults, watching
television shows for adults and having sex. The answer, the child
development experts say, lies in letting boys stay young longer,
through more parental guidance and supervision, more mentoring and,
for disturbed boys, more counseling before emotional problems lead
to potentially lethal violence. Yet the nation's juvenile justice
system is rapidly moving in the opposite direction, with ever more
boys being tried as adults. By Keith Bradsher. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-DIET-REVIEW (Undated) _ If it tastes good, eat it! Paul
Rozin, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, offers a
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans yet suffer fewer health consequences. Where other
researchers have offered reasons ranging from genetic differences
to red wine consumption, Rozin suggests that it may all come down
to one's state of mind. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Every major presidential
candidate is spending money to assemble focus groups to glean
intelligence on everything from fashion to policy. Their reliance
on these groups underscores the degree to which politicians _ in
trying to capture the attention of an often distracted public _
find themselves worrying as much about presentation as about
substance. While many campaigns say the groups give them tips that
cannot be found in sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings
are hardly representative of the electorate. By Richard L. Berke
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The big questions now about
unemployment are how low it can go, and whether the low rate can be
sustained over the long run as the economy and the population
change. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan feels the jobless rate should
not go much lower, or else there could be inflationary pressures as
employers are forced to raise prices after bidding up pay for
scarce workers. But there is considerable uncertainty among other
economists about how low unemployment can go before the risks
outweigh the benefits. By Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.

   DOCTORS-TRAINING-REVIEW (Undated) _ How long does it take to
make a doctor? Book-smart youngsters with new diplomas slink out of
medical school knowing that they are impostors. A few years later
they discover they have turned into doctors. And, for all the
tinkering with those years by generations of medical educators, the
alchemy of the transformation and how long it should take remain
almost as mysterious as ever. A look at some problems in medical
training and efforts to resolve them. By Abigail Zuger.

   EUROPE-U.S.-POLITICS-REVIEW (Florence, Italy) _ Leaders from
Bill Clinton to Gerhard Schroeder like to declare themselves
newfound allies in championing market-friendly governments that
still look out for the less fortunate. Out with tax-and-spend,
state-heavy irresponsibility _ in with the new culture of fiscal
conservatism and opportunity. But this surface accord masks

   CHINA-TRADE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ After months of speculation that
conservative, protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand,
China made sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and

Party leaders believe that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these men
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power. By Erik Eckholm.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 21, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds POLLING-APATHY-REVIEW, plus graphics
notes on three other stories.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russia's brutal effort to
subdue runaway Chechnya is messily wiping out civilians and
soldiers alike, drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation,
working quite well, thank you. Americans cannot truly imagine
Russians' frustration at their imperial disintegration and economic
collapse. But perhaps they can get a sense of the emotional release
that Chechnya evokes among Russians by recalling how good it felt,
after two decades of Vietnam, Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to
finally regain their military prowess by striking back first at
Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then, far more dramatically, against
Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991. By Michael Wines. WITH GRAPHIC.
(Moved in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   POLLING-RELIABILITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Most politicians'
vigilant reliance on poll numbers raises an important but
seldom-asked public policy question: Who actually talks to
pollsters and who does not? The answer, it turns out, is troubling
news for the polling industry and the people who rely on the
numbers: Far fewer people agree to participate in surveys than just
10 years ago, a fact that some critics call the industry's dirty
little secret, because most polling firms refuse to divulge their
surveys' refusal rates. By Don Van Natta. (Moved in the `a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   With sidebar:
</P>
<P>
   POLLING-APATHY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Is the public really paying
attention to politics and various issues on which polls focus? Many
experts warn that Americans are growing increasingly detached from
the political process in more fundamental ways. By Robin Toner.
(Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE-JUSTICE-REVIEW (Pontiac, Mich.) _ Many psychologists
and sociologists nowadays worry that boys are growing up too fast
these days. Boys are increasingly dressing like adults, watching
television shows for adults and having sex. The answer, the child
development experts say, lies in letting boys stay young longer,
through more parental guidance and supervision, more mentoring and,
for disturbed boys, more counseling before emotional problems lead
to potentially lethal violence. Yet the nation's juvenile justice
system is rapidly moving in the opposite direction, with ever more
boys being tried as adults. By Keith Bradsher. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-DIET-REVIEW (Undated) _ If it tastes good, eat it! Paul
Rozin, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, offers a
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans yet suffer fewer health consequences. Where other
researchers have offered reasons ranging from genetic differences
to red wine consumption, Rozin suggests that it may all come down
to one's state of mind. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Every major presidential
candidate is spending money to assemble focus groups to glean
intelligence on everything from fashion to policy. Their reliance
on these groups underscores the degree to which politicians _ in
trying to capture the attention of an often distracted public _
find themselves worrying as much about presentation as about
substance. While many campaigns say the groups give them tips that
cannot be found in sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings
are hardly representative of the electorate. By Richard L. Berke
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The big questions now about
unemployment are how low it can go, and whether the low rate can be
sustained over the long run as the economy and the population
change. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan feels the jobless rate should
not go much lower, or else there could be inflationary pressures as
employers are forced to raise prices after bidding up pay for
scarce workers. But there is considerable uncertainty among other
economists about how low unemployment can go before the risks
outweigh the benefits. By Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Only a few weeks ago, after the uninspired 50th
anniversary extravaganza for the People's Republic that equated
President Jiang Zemin with Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
became a victim of Beijing's merciless joke circuit. In stories
told in quiet tea houses and at raucous dinner parties _ the
nearest thing here to Jay Leno's monologues as an index of
political fortunes _ Jiang was portrayed as lacking the vision and
stature that this foundering country needs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-repeated jokes imagined the president's thoughts
during the anniversary parade. He looks to the north, the story
goes, and sees millions of unemployed workers. He looks to the
south and sees millions of prostitutes. He looks to the east and
sees the vast smuggling of goods and he looks to the west and sees
ethnic rebellions. He looks to the sky and sees NATO bombs falling,
then he looks down and finds himself surrounded by Falun Gong
demonstrators intent on continuing their spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang walks to the Mao mausoleum to ask the Great Helmsman's
advice. After hearing all the woes, Mao rises up from his crypt and
says, ``You'd better lie down here, I'll take charge.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't telling that one any more last week, after Jiang
and his fellow party chiefs signed a trade deal with America that
seemed breathtaking in its implications and anything but lacking in
vision. After months of speculation that conservative,
protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand, China made
sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and foreign
investment and to accept international rules governing these
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese experts even compared the agreement, which
Americans demanded in return for supporting the country's entry
into the World Trade Organization, to Deng Xiaoping's momentous
``opening and reform'' of the late 1970s, when he cast aside Mao's
screwball economics and introduced market incentives.
</P>
<P>
   China's signature Monday showed that Jiang, and most if not all
of the other six Communist Party leaders who make major decisions
here, are convinced that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these seven
men, who serve on the all-powerful politburo standing committee,
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of pact with the devil,'' said Andrew J. Nathan, a
political scientist at Columbia University. ``You compromise on
some aspects of social and economic control, and hope you can keep
political control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the risks are obvious. Wringing out the state sector and
creating competitive companies, as China hopes to do as a member of
the World Trade Organization, should eventually bring about a
richer, more efficient country. But the lower agricultural tariffs
China agreed to last week will mean a ``blood bath'' for farmers,
as a Western economist said here, forcing more migrants into cities
where they will compete with laid-off factory workers for jobs. In
urban areas, freer trade and investment will cause temporary
dislocations as leaner, technologically advanced foreign companies
wipe out bloated domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Even without foreign competition, angry workers and farmers have
protested often enough to put the government on edge. Leaders and
citizens alike know that, at this point in Communist rule,
political obedience depends on the party's ability to deliver
greater wealth.
</P>
<P>
   For the party, there is also a deeper long-term risk. From
President Clinton to eternally hopeful liberals inside China, some
openly voiced the thesis last week that an influx of foreign
companies, and the enforced discipline of global trade rules, will
promote the rule of law and prod along political change.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts think, too, that a growing middle class that owns
homes and businesses and pays taxes will demand a greater voice in
government, and form interest groups outside party control. In the
last two decades, the Mao era's grip over personal decisions like
how and where to live and work has greatly weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Fair and predictable enforcement of rules, in business and
throughout society, will certainly improve daily life and aid
China's development. But this is already a prime goal of the
Communist Party leaders, who know that widespread corruption and
arbitrary decisions are corroding the last remnants of popular
faith. In the battle against corrupt provincial and local officials
and in their efforts to build a trimmer, better-educated
bureaucracy, the leaders hope to gain efficiency and also bolster
the party's rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese leaders clearly don't embrace the theory that
political change is inevitable,'' said Nathan. ``They intend to
keep a monopoly on political power while still opening the economy.
They no longer insist on compete control over everything because
they realize they don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The global corporations speak in evangelical terms about their
ultimate impact on society, but they are in China for one reason _
to make money. Their greatest need is clear rules, predictability
and social stability. It may well be, as U.S. diplomats argue,
that, as society becomes more sophisticated and diverse, a
political opening will be vital to preserving stability. But it may
also be that political change, when it happens, will not come
smoothly or peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the rest of the world might do well to assume
that Jiang and his comrades know more about how to survive as
Communist Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, common sense suggests that the
expanding flow of information _ now aided by the Internet, a true
devil with which the Communists feel they must consort _ will
create deep and unsettling consequences. Monday's pact should
accelerate this subversive exchange of facts and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the mythical patience of the Chinese, politicians
here have to worry a lot more about tomorrow than about the next
year, or the next decade. With his bold promise last week to
embrace the modern world, Jiang has given the Chinese people hopes
and dreams that may sustain them for a while. If all the
contradictions come crashing together one day, well, he is gambling
that may be on someone else's watch.

TRIUMPHANT, THE LEFT ASKS WHAT ELSE IT IS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ As leaders of the center-left parties that govern much
of the Western world gather in resplendent Renaissance palaces in
Florence this weekend to ponder the course of the fuzzy but
resonant political idea some of them call the ``third way,'' sharp
differences are evident as to what social democracy in the
post-Cold War world should be.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from Bill Clinton to Gerhard Schroeder like to declare
themselves newfound allies in championing market-friendly
governments that still look out for the less fortunate. Out with
tax-and-spend, state-heavy irresponsibility _ in with the new
culture of fiscal conservatism and opportunity. But this surface
accord masks fundamental questions about a ``third way'' ideology
that is part marketing tool, part pragmatism and part the
innovative fruit of the left's past failures.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions in Europe are particularly profound. Britain, like
Bill Clinton's America, is a transformed society, steered to a new
entrepreneurial culture first by Margaret Thatcher and now through
the pro-market centrism of Tony Blair; France is loudly proclaiming
its loyalty to socialism while quietly installing a market-oriented
culture; and Germany is struggling to begin reforms that would end
what Schroeder has dismissively called ``the nanny state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the center-left, Britain does what it says, France does
what it says it will not do and Germany says a lot without proving
able to do much. But there is a central dilemma: the left, once
unified in Europe around the idea of class struggle, has not yet
figured out exactly whom it represents these days and, as a result,
what its priorities should be. Is its most important constituency
still workers and state employees, or young founders of Internet
companies with progressive ideas?
</P>
<P>
   This has been a heady decade for Democrats and Social Democrats.
Seldom has so much power accumulated so fast in one political
family. Deprived of their old communist enemy and disoriented by
the global economy's erosion of such traditional conservative
values as the nation, right-wing political forces have reeled. In
their place, leaders like Blair, Schroeder and Lionel Jospin of
France have stepped forward with a new message in which the
Clintonian echoes have often been unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Clinton years have brought America many
results of which Europeans can only dream: a budget surplus, the
creation of close to 19 million new jobs, sustained growth,
virtually full employment and welfare rolls at a 30-year low. But
at the meeting in Florence convened to ponder 21st-century
``progressive governance,'' Clinton will find his ideas challenged
by Europeans still struggling to galvanize their economies.
</P>
<P>
   At a fundamental level, globalization has challenged the left by
changing the workplace in which socialism evolved. With less than
20 percent of workers in western Europe in factories, the working
class has become less relevant. In a way, this has opened new
opportunities for the pursuit of equality conceived as something
beyond the old vision of class conflict or social leveling, and
more as equality of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But equality, in the words of Ronald Dworkin, a legal scholar at
New York University, ``is now thought to be electoral poison in the
United States and basically has gone off the screen.'' America is
growing more unequal. And, even in Europe, at least outside France,
the idea of ``sufficiency'' has gained ground as a more important
value than ``equality'': society should provide a bare minimum of
social protection and equality of starting positions, but no more
than that.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to move in this ideological direction has come
partly from the global economy. Countries including Germany and
France have seen their state-heavy economic systems challenged by
new demands for competition. Unemployment rates have stayed
stubbornly in the 10 percent range, and employers point to
comprehensive welfare systems that add heavy social insurance
charges to wage costs. Why get a job if benefits plus occasional
work off the books provide a better income?
</P>
<P>
   In the grand tradition of Franco-American sparring, the French _
on the surface, at least _ are clearly most resistant to the notion
of a third way. The platform of Jospin's party for the last meeting
of the Socialist International said capitalism was ``unjust and
often irrational.'' When Jospin deploys his mantra _ ``We reject
the market society'' _ he leaves little doubt that he is referring
to the United States of the super Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Such oratory still has a ring to it. But it is something of a
smokescreen, deployed to mask the radical market-oriented changes
that Jospin's socialists have quietly encouraged in recent years:
sweeping privatization, encouragement of stock options, support for
a nascent share-holding culture inspired by the success of such
former state monopolies as France Telecom. It is not for nothing
that the Bourse has soared: investors understand that left-leaning
theory may be the best buttress for a right-leaning reality.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite has been true in Germany, where the culture is more
literal and conservative. Schroeder, for example, emphasizes a
centrist stance to the point of calling his political platform
``The New Middle.'' But German society has been slow to change,
lagging behind France in flexibility and growth, far exceeding
France in wage costs. ``Germany is still an example of socialism at
work,'' said Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet the policy paper on a reinvented left that Schroeder
co-signed with Blair this summer amounted to a remarkably fulsome
endorsement of Clinton's favorite themes. ``Too often rights were
elevated above responsibilities'' by former governments of the
left, the two leaders said, adding that the responsibility of the
individual ``cannot be off-loaded on the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine words, but Germany and Britain remain far apart in reality.
They differ on whether a rampant market should be embraced or
reined in; and what, if anything, to do about regulating the
Internet-driven zone where human activity seems to lie beyond the
control of individual nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different words for different traditions, but the fact
is we have all reached a new place,'' said Sidney Blumenthal, an
adviser to President Clinton. ``We are in the new economy, whether
we like it or not. What is the alternative? Close your economy?
Reflate? Nobody among these center-left leaders is doing that
because everybody knows it leads straight to disaster.'' True, but
the cultural gulfs remain striking. The French, for example, remain
far more adamant about insuring what Jospin calls ``the precedence
of the political over the economic.''
</P>
<P>
   A great Florentine political thinker also believed in that
precedence. His name was Machiavelli and he wrote: ``Above all, a
prince strives to gain from all his acts notoriety as a strong man
of superior ability.'' On that, at least, the still ascendant
center-left might agree. For if Clinton, Blair, Jospin and
Schroeder have one thing in common, it is an intensely pragmatic
nose for power that is stronger than any surviving Socialist,
Social Democratic or Democratic principle in this post-ideological
age.

TRIUMPHANT, THE LEFT ASKS WHAT ELSE IT IS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   BERLIN _ As leaders of the center-left parties that govern much
of the Western world gather in resplendent Renaissance palaces in
Florence this weekend to ponder the course of the fuzzy but
resonant political idea some of them call the ``third way,'' sharp
differences are evident as to what social democracy in the
post-Cold War world should be.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from Bill Clinton to Gerhard Schroeder like to declare
themselves newfound allies in championing market-friendly
governments that still look out for the less fortunate. Out with
tax-and-spend, state-heavy irresponsibility _ in with the new
culture of fiscal conservatism and opportunity. But this surface
accord masks fundamental questions about a ``third way'' ideology
that is part marketing tool, part pragmatism and part the
innovative fruit of the left's past failures.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions in Europe are particularly profound. Britain, like
Bill Clinton's America, is a transformed society, steered to a new
entrepreneurial culture first by Margaret Thatcher and now through
the pro-market centrism of Tony Blair; France is loudly proclaiming
its loyalty to socialism while quietly installing a market-oriented
culture; and Germany is struggling to begin reforms that would end
what Schroeder has dismissively called ``the nanny state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the center-left, Britain does what it says, France does
what it says it will not do and Germany says a lot without proving
able to do much. But there is a central dilemma: the left, once
unified in Europe around the idea of class struggle, has not yet
figured out exactly whom it represents these days and, as a result,
what its priorities should be. Is its most important constituency
still workers and state employees, or young founders of Internet
companies with progressive ideas?
</P>
<P>
   This has been a heady decade for Democrats and Social Democrats.
Seldom has so much power accumulated so fast in one political
family. Deprived of their old communist enemy and disoriented by
the global economy's erosion of such traditional conservative
values as the nation, right-wing political forces have reeled. In
their place, leaders like Blair, Schroeder and Lionel Jospin of
France have stepped forward with a new message in which the
Clintonian echoes have often been unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Clinton years have brought America many
results of which Europeans can only dream: a budget surplus, the
creation of close to 19 million new jobs, sustained growth,
virtually full employment and welfare rolls at a 30-year low. But
at the meeting in Florence convened to ponder 21st-century
``progressive governance,'' Clinton will find his ideas challenged
by Europeans still struggling to galvanize their economies.
</P>
<P>
   At a fundamental level, globalization has challenged the left by
changing the workplace in which socialism evolved. With less than
20 percent of workers in western Europe in factories, the working
class has become less relevant. In a way, this has opened new

   Before scurrying to their fortified bunkers and underground bomb

antibiotics? Clean the rifles? Replenish the pantry with plenty of

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Beware of Greeks bearing flags
 &HT;    For release Nov. 24, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The demonstrators have been described both as anarchists and
communists; an awkward alignment of contrasting beliefs. They tore
through the streets of downtown Athens, torching businesses,
looting and, of course, burning the American flag practically under
the nose of visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many amendments the Congress tries to shove into
our Constitution, one banning flag burning will have no consequence
in Athens, or Baghdad, even Belgrade. They're beyond our
Constitutional reach. Where they get all those flags to burn is of
interest to me, as I would like to buy into what must be a
profitable business of supplying particularly incendiary American
flags to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, 10,000 Greeks torched their own capital _ and some
American flags _ to protest U.S. policy in Yugoslavia, Kosovo and
Bosnia, all of which shows you how stupid they are. ``We've Burned
Ourselves,'' Reuters News Service quoted a leading Athens newspaper
headline.
</P>
<P>
   It always has impressed me that American flags are game for
flame for any of our diverse worldwide foreign policies but when
the Soviets and, now, the Russians are involved in controversial
conduct, it doesn't seem to happen.
</P>
<P>
   This likely is because no one is producing Russian flags as
quickly as they are American flags. Availability is critical to
flag burners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Russians slaughtering Chechnyans and, several years
earlier, Afghans, there seems to be a noticeable need for Russian
flags to burn. As we mass produce American flags for foreign
conflagration, we ought to think of doing the same with Russian
flags. We could be well into a thriving export business which would
go toward helping us repay some of the money we either loan or
otherwise allow to sift into foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
   With the anarchist/communist underbelly of Greece evident and
with Clinton, in one of his Jimmy Carter-like moments of contrition
over the U.S. supporting a Greek military junta in 1967, I was
wondering if anyone in Greece was considering thanking us for other
measures we took on behalf of the Greek people?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps memories do not go back as far as 1947 when Harry Truman
and the U.S. Congress rushed to support the Greek people who were
threatened by advancing Soviet communism. Hundreds of millions of
dollars were shipped to Athens so the nation could remain
independent of Soviet control.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, things did go bad with the junta we supported in
1967, especially the deadly crackdown it committed on student
demonstrators in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a Cold War thing, us supporting the military right
against a rebellious left that was tied to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   That left apparently has not forgotten the U.S. and the junta,
and never wanted to remember the U.S. saving Greece from communism
in 1947. Each year at this time, much of the same group stages
anti-American protests for our support of the junta. Usually, it
goes unnoticed by the world media. But when the president of the
United States happens to be in Greece at the same time, followed by
a press corps the size of Texas, it becomes more of a launching pad
for violence and grievance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the cost of being a world policeman. I don't believe
that the U.S. so much wants to be the global cop as it has been
kept in that position by a world that cannot get along, either
internally or across borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of that assignment, mistakes certainly can be
made. They subsequently result in flag burning and other
interruptions to normal relations. The Chinese went on a nifty
flag-burning bent after we mistakenly and stupidly bombed their
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-American protest in Athens had to do more with ethnic
bonding than anything else. The Greeks are close to the Serbians,
just as are the Russians. No matter the ritual slaughter of
Albanian Kosovars at the hands of the Serbians, which brought the
U.S. into the melee, the Serbians could do no wrong in the minds of
the protesting Athenians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit simply inflamed the fringe of Greek politics.
</P>
<P>
   And it did wonders for the flag salesmen.

   WASHINGTON _ It is hard to walk into a store these days without
confronting a help-wanted sign. Software whizzes and hamburger
flippers alike can take their pick of jobs, and increasingly can
expect not only a fatter paycheck but some kind of sign-on bonus.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good time to be working, by most measures the best in
a generation. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate in October 1999
was the lowest since January 1970. Joblessness has been below 4.5
percent for a year, and below 5 percent for nearly two-and-a-half
years.
</P>
<P>
   The big questions now about unemployment are how low it can go _
and whether the improvement can be sustained over the long run as
the economy and the population change.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, for one, seems to think
the unemployment rate should not go much lower. He raised interest
rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point, the third time
he has done so this year, in large part because of concern that the
economy is literally running out of workers to fill all the jobs
being created.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's fear is that as companies have a harder time finding
the workers needed to expand or to replace employees who have left
for better jobs, they will bid up wages, and then raise prices to
maintain their profit margins, setting off an inflationary spiral
that could derail the long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For years, analysts believed that inflation danger signals would
start flashing red if unemployment dropped below about 6 percent
and the economy continued growing at a robust pace. The experience
of the past few years suggests that this so-called ``natural''
unemployment rate is substantially lower, and that the concept is
not precise enough to be used by the Federal Reserve to determine
when to hit the economic brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one knows for sure whether the current jobless rate is
too low for the economy's overall good or whether there is room for
it to drop further. The answer hinges on the economy's ability to
generate increases in the growth rate of productivity _ the amount
each worker can produce in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   From the early 1970s until the mid '90s, productivity appeared
to be growing at about 1 percent a year, a lackluster performance
that had economists puzzled. But in the last few years,
productivity growth has been surging. If the productivity
improvement sticks, the result would be more job creation and
downward pressure on unemployment rates with less risk of inflation
_ what some analysts call the ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem now is that growth and unemployment are straining
against the limits of what even the new economy would permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have an overheated new economy just like you can have
an overheated old economy,'' said Richard Herd, an economist at the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research
group for the world's industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, one of the biggest influences on the labor
market is sure to be the immense demographic shift the United
States is undergoing. Population growth is slowing, and as the baby
boom generation ages, the nation is getting much older.
</P>
<P>
   One implication is clear: the working age population will be
smaller, suggesting at first blush that very low unemployment might
be the wave of the future. But predicting the effect of the
demographic shifts on issues like unemployment is a hazardous
business.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, slower population growth does not necessarily
mean that there will be fewer workers competing for each job. If
population growth slows without an offsetting increase in
productivity, economic growth could be expected to decline as well,
and so would job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economy's cyclical ups and downs have proven more
powerful so far in determining unemployment than the size of the
labor pool. In Japan, for example, the working age population is
beginning to shrink, yet the unemployment rate has been going up as
the economy suffers through a long downturn. And while there is no
obvious reason why the long economic expansion in the United States
should end anytime soon, the business cycle is by no means dead.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and the size of the labor pool could also be
tremendously influenced by any rise or fall in immigration, or by
changes in the age at which workers choose to retire. A long trend
toward earlier retirement now seems to be giving way to a
willingness or need on the part of many older people to keep
working at least part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply knowing ahead of time the ratio of workers to
non-workers takes you a little way toward answering questions like
the implications for unemployment,'' said Gary Burtless, an
economist at the Brookings Institution. ``But it doesn't take you
terribly far, because that could be determined by other policy
choices or some kind of economic shock.''

THE HOURS THAT MAKE A STUDENT AN M.D. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young doctor was reminiscing about his first year out of
medical school. ``I was chronically in a terribly nervous state,''
he wrote. ``Nearly every case disclosed to me more and more plainly
the depth of my ignorance, my utter unpreparedness and
incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been any intern who started working at any
teaching hospital in the country last July (``It was mortifying to
discover that I lacked the knowledge which every nurse
possesses.'') He could have been me 18 years ago, or any other
doctor at almost any time in history. The emotions an obscure
Russian named Vikenty Veressayev detailed in his little-known 1916
classic, ``Memoirs of a Physician,'' are a given in medicine: the
panic, self-doubt, profound exhaustion and occasional exhilaration
of that first year out.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries book-smart youngsters with new diplomas have slunk
out of medical school knowing, if they have any sense at all, that
they are impostors. A few years later they discover they have
turned into doctors. And, for all the tinkering with those years by
generations of medical educators, the alchemy of the transformation
remains almost as mysterious as ever.
</P>
<P>
   How many hours does it actually take to make a doctor? This is
still one of the big mysteries of the process. Is medical care
better delivered by a fatigued young doctor who has been at your
bedside 36 hours _ or by a succession of fresh young strangers who
work shorter shifts, and have heard about you through the medical
equivalent of the game of telephone?
</P>
<P>
   This century has seen a dramatic evolution in medical training
from long working hours to shorter ones. Up through World War II,
interns and residents in the United States were indentured servants
in hospitals, available 24 hours a day. Most received little
compensation (except for room and board) along with a free-form
education that was shaped by whatever sick patients and senior
physicians happened by.
</P>
<P>
   Now their dual roles of worker and student are more precisely
defined. As workers, interns and residents get days off and a
living wage. As students, they attend lectures and conferences that
encompass social and economic aspects of medicine long ignored in
medical training. And as indentured servants _ for they continue to
work many extra hours for the health care system _ they at least
have the satisfaction of knowing that their day-to-day welfare is
of more concern to their employers than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when interns worked every night or every other
night, the pace of the work was slow enough that they could
actually get some sleep. Technology put an end to that: in the
1970s and 1980s 36-hour stretches without a nap became commonplace,
and workweeks could stretch to 100 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working a double?'' a nurse once asked me when she noticed one
morning that I was in the same place (and in the same clothes) she
had seen me the evening before. I pointed out that I was actually
working a quintuple, as I would every third night for most of my
three years of residency.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible accident changed that routine in New York. The death
of a young woman, Libby Zion, was traced directly to these long,
unsupervised hours, and in July 1989 the state Hospital Code was
amended to restrict the average workweek to no more than 80 hours
and mandate that a senior physician be available to supervise at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   New York remains the only state where these stipulations are
law, but they are rapidly becoming the standard elsewhere. All
internal medicine training programs are now held to similar
standards, and failure to comply may result in a loss of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical specialties are following suit. So are other
countries: New Zealand long ago limited its residents to a 72-hour
workweek, and the European Union is now hashing out the
practicalities of a 48-hour week for the 270,000 trainees in its
member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have now found that the mistakes doctors make
from fatigue do diminish with shorter work hours, but they are
replaced by errors that result when a patient's care is transferred
from one doctor to another at the end of shorter shifts. No study
has yet addressed the broader question: Will shorter workdays keep
interns and residents from developing the important instincts those
awful long nights hammered in _ a sense of the pace of illness and
recovery, of what is likely to happen to a patient and when?
</P>
<P>
   These details are, of course, the easy part of a medical
education. I must grudgingly admit that the grisly old days of
training _ may they never return _ helped teach us one of the
harder lessons too.
</P>
<P>
   Interns and residents are a spectacularly healthy lot of young
people. Most are far too young to have encountered illness or death
among friends or relatives; fewer still have ever been ill
themselves. Yet somehow they all must learn to bridge a huge gap of
imagination and develop some real feeling for the subjective
experience, as well as the objective appearance, of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say studying literature and the humanities can
teach this kind of empathy. Others doubt it can be taught at all.
One famous professor simply suggested that all interns be required
to use a bedpan in front of a silent group of white-coated
strangers, and see how it feels for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But here is an alternate route to empathy: stay awake every
third night for three years, tired, aching, nauseated and terrified
that despite the very best intentions in the world you are about to
make a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck at all you will get a vague idea of how it must
feel to be truly sick, powerless and frightened _ and with any luck
the lesson will stick even after it is all over.

   For centuries book-smart youngsters with new diplomas have slunk
out of medical school knowing, if they have any sense at all, that
they are impostors. A few years later they discover they have
turned into doctors. And, for all the tinkering with those years by
generations of medical educators, the alchemy of the transformation
remains almost as mysterious as ever.
</P>
<P>
   How many hours does it actually take to make a doctor? This is
still one of the big mysteries of the process. Is medical care
better delivered by a fatigued young doctor who has been at your
bedside 36 hours _ or by a succession of fresh young strangers who
work shorter shifts, and have heard about you through the medical
equivalent of the game of telephone?
</P>
<P>
   This century has seen a dramatic evolution in medical training
from long working hours to shorter ones. Up through World War II,
interns and residents in the United States were indentured servants
in hospitals, available 24 hours a day. Most received little
compensation (except for room and board) along with a free-form
education that was shaped by whatever sick patients and senior
physicians happened by.
</P>
<P>
   Now their dual roles of worker and student are more precisely
defined. As workers, interns and residents get days off and a
living wage. As students, they attend lectures and conferences that
encompass social and economic aspects of medicine long ignored in
medical training. And as indentured servants _ for they continue to
work many extra hours for the health care system _ they at least
have the satisfaction of knowing that their day-to-day welfare is
of more concern to their employers than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when interns worked every night or every other
night, the pace of the work was slow enough that they could
actually get some sleep. Technology put an end to that: in the
1970s and 1980s 36-hour stretches without a nap became commonplace,
and workweeks could stretch to 100 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working a double?'' a nurse once asked me when she noticed one
morning that I was in the same place (and in the same clothes) she
had seen me the evening before. I pointed out that I was actually
working a quintuple, as I would every third night for most of my
three years of residency.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible accident changed that routine in New York. The death
of a young woman, Libby Zion, was traced directly to these long,
unsupervised hours, and in July 1989 the state Hospital Code was
amended to restrict the average workweek to no more than 80 hours
and mandate that a senior physician be available to supervise at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   New York remains the only state where these stipulations are
law, but they are rapidly becoming the standard elsewhere. All
internal medicine training programs are now held to similar
standards, and failure to comply may result in a loss of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical specialties are following suit. So are other
countries: New Zealand long ago limited its residents to a 72-hour
workweek, and the European Union is now hashing out the
practicalities of a 48-hour week for the 270,000 trainees in its
member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have now found that the mistakes doctors make
from fatigue do diminish with shorter work hours, but they are
replaced by errors that result when a patient's care is transferred
from one doctor to another at the end of shorter shifts. No study
has yet addressed the broader question: Will shorter workdays keep
interns and residents from developing the important instincts those
awful long nights hammered in _ a sense of the pace of illness and
recovery, of what is likely to happen to a patient and when?
</P>
<P>
   These details are, of course, the easy part of a medical
education. I must grudgingly admit that the grisly old days of
training _ may they never return _ helped teach us one of the
harder lessons too.
</P>
<P>
   Interns and residents are a spectacularly healthy lot of young
people. Most are far too young to have encountered illness or death
among friends or relatives; fewer still have ever been ill
themselves. Yet somehow they all must learn to bridge a huge gap of
imagination and develop some real feeling for the subjective
experience, as well as the objective appearance, of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say studying literature and the humanities can
teach this kind of empathy. Others doubt it can be taught at all.
One famous professor simply suggested that all interns be required
to use a bedpan in front of a silent group of white-coated
strangers, and see how it feels for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But here is an alternate route to empathy: stay awake every
third night for three years, tired, aching, nauseated and terrified
that despite the very best intentions in the world you are about to
make a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck at all you will get a vague idea of how it must
feel to be truly sick, powerless and frightened _ and with any luck
the lesson will stick even after it is all over.

THANKS FOR SHARING: FOCUS GROUPS SOMETIMES EMPHASIZE THE TRIVIAL

   WASHINGTON _ In what has become an expensive ritual of
presidential politics, the Steve Forbes campaign recently assembled
about a dozen potential voters around a table in Iowa so they could
kibbitz about his possible television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: High marks for substance. Low marks for
presentation _ specifically, the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   While the likely Republican voters were quite taken with Forbes'
plans to revamp the tax code and overhaul Social Security, several
also said the candidate was not suitably telegenic to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get by his looks with me,'' one woman said. ``He
doesn't have that charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she suggested that Forbes might be a good antidote to the
current administration, saying, ``It might not be too bad after the
last seven years!''
</P>
<P>
   As they seek to hone their messages or avoid ineffective
advertising, every major presidential candidate is spending money
on focus groups, gleaning intelligence on everything from fashion
to policy. President Clinton, who probably has turned to focus
groups more than any other politician, once said, ``There is no one
more powerful than a member of a focus group.''
</P>
<P>
   The reliance on these groups underscores the degree to which
politicians trying to capture the attention of an often distracted
public find themselves fretting as much about show as about
substance. While many strategists say that such tips cannot be
mined from sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings are
hardly representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are spending a lot of money, and you have different
options available to you,'' said Mark McKinnon, media consultant
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, ``you want to find out
which options make the most sense. But they can be flawed. Too many
people make quantitative decisions based on qualitative research.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, a consultant for Forbes, agreed. ``You have to
take them with a grain of salt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes of two focus groups conducted earlier this month in Iowa,
provided by Forbes' advisers to The New York Times, opened a rare
window into how one campaign settles on its advertising. In these
tapes, participants twisted dials to show what parts of the
commercials they liked or disliked, including ads of Bush that had
already been broadcast. Afterward, participants engaged in a fairly
open-ended discussion. The participants, who were paid for their
time, were not told that the Forbes campaign was conducting the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign received tapes of the ads showing exactly what
parts the group found appealing, including breakdowns by male and
female. As a result, the Forbes campaign scrapped three commercials
that tested poorly. But there was good news: roughly half the
participants said after viewing the advertisements that they would
probably back Forbes. They generally liked the substance of most of
the Forbes and Bush commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The big hitch for Forbes was that the viewers seemed fixated on
his appearance. Several suggested fewer close-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In one group, a woman offered only compliments of two Forbes
commercials: ``They're just very clear. There's no spin in them.
It's, `Who I am and what I believe.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion quickly degenerated when another woman
interjected, ``He has some skin problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The first woman defended Forbes, saying: ``This does not bother
me because I like his message. But I know a lot of people who look
at these ads _ and they're shallow. When you get his face too close
up, your mind is on his blemishes _ and it's really a shame,
because he has an awful lot to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   After viewing ads on Forbes' tax plan, one woman said, ``He came
across as really sincere _ that he genuinely believes this is what
is in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the focus group's moderator asked about the general
presentation, another woman suggested that the ad focus ``a little
less on him _ he's not real photogenic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the conversation turned to another commercial, a woman
complained that it ``was too long'' and featured ``too much of his
face at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman piped in, ``He doesn't look sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   A man, interrupting, said, ``It's almost like, `I don't believe
my own message.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then a woman defended him, saying, ``He's a very serious
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants seemed to like a commercial that showed Forbes'
accomplishments in business and in public service. ``One of the
complaints has been that he's never been elected to office,'' one
woman said. ``This shows he has done some other things.'' But often
the conversation drifted back to Forbes' complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants suggested that Forbes might smile or laugh
more. ``It made him seem more real,'' one man said. ``When he's got
a serious look on his face, it's not as appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   In dissecting Bush's commercials, one man dismissed the
candidate's accomplishments in Texas: ``I could care less what he's
done in Texas. I want to know what he's going to do for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But a woman, who liked how Bush looked, said: ``He rolls up his
white shirt sleeves and throws his jacket over like he's kind of
casual. And that's appealing, where Forbes is more stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said of Forbes, ``This may sound frivolous, but he
seems like such a rich guy with that suit and tie on _ you take
that jacket off.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the participants sounded a bit sheepish about their
emphasis on the trivial. ``This is a very superficial comment, and
I hesitate to make it,'' one man said. ``But he's not the most
attractive or presidential-looking candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes should not despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may very well say, `I like the blue tie over the red
tie,''' said Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary and a
supporter of Al Gore for president. ``But really they are most
concerned about their children's future and education and health
care. They'll give you their opinion on the tie _ but I don't know
how relevant it is.''

FRENCH DIET SECRET: IF IT FEELS GOOD, EAT IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's insouciance. Maybe it's sang-froid. Or maybe it's
that certain je ne sais quoi.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, an American researcher is offering a possible
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans, yet seem to suffer fewer health consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Where other researchers have offered reasons ranging from
genetic differences to the red wine that often accompanies foie
gras, Dr. Paul Rozin, a psychology professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, suggests that it may all come down to one's state of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: Could it be that if you think of that ice cream
sundae you're about to wolf down as your friend _ and not your
vanquisher _ you might be the healthier for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense among many Americans that food is as much a
poison as it is a nutrient, and that eating is almost as dangerous
as not eating,'' Rozin writes in the current issue of the journal
Appetite.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, surely there is no time of year more perilous to
the American palate than the season of excess and remorse that
begins this week with Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin bases his theory, which he admits he would be hard put to
prove, on a survey he and his associates did of more than 1,000
people, mostly in America and France, but also in Belgium and
Japan. Researchers questioned people at railroad stations and
airports and college students.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the French _ only 4 percent of whom are said to
follow diets in line with the American recommended guidelines for
fat intake _ associate eating more with pleasure than with health.
Americans, on the other hand (and, overall, women in all
countries), not only associate food with nutrition but worry about
it, too. The Belgians and the Japanese tend to fall in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unreasonable to assume,'' Rozin writes, ``that when
a major aspect of life becomes a stress and source of substantial
worry, as opposed to a pleasure, effects might be seen in both
cardiovascular and immune systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the study may amount to little more than further
evidence that reducing stress _ whether about food or anything else
_ is good for one's health. It is well established that a positive
mental outlook may not only ward off illness but even help bring
about a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if nothing else, the article provides yet another
illustration of how Americans and the French differ over matters of
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge people's attitudes toward food and health, the
researchers asked some two dozen questions.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed were queried, for example, about which word
they associated with ice cream: delicious or fattening. About 31
percent of Americans chose fattening, compared with fewer than 22
percent of the French.
</P>
<P>
   They were also given the words bread, pasta and sauce, and asked
to pick the one that did not belong. The French, presumably
appalled at the notion of dry noodles, generally gave the boot to
the bread; a somewhat higher number of Americans, dutifully
grouping together their carbohydrates, dispensed with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   People were even asked whether they would take a daily pill
instead of eating if it would safely satisfy their hunger and
nutritional needs. About 26 percent of the Americans said they
would, more than twice the percentage of French.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin, who specializes in the psychology of food (his past work
includes trying to explain the near-mystical allure of chocolate
and why cultures differ on which foods are considered edible and
which are beyond the pale), acknowledged the limits of his study.
He said any number of cultural differences like income and
religion, which people were not queried about, could help explain
the differing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that the ``French paradox'' _ as the
disparity between France's rich diet and general good health is
often called _ may result, as some nutritionists believe, simply
from the fact that the French consume far fewer calories overall
than do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin said he did not expect mainstream American nutrition
experts to rush to embrace his theory. ``A good part of the
American health community is out to nail foods as good or bad for
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Lichtenstein, a biochemist and nutritionist at Tufts
University, took issue with both Rozin's research methodology and
his conclusions. ``It's not clear to me that, by encouraging people
to enjoy their food more, they're going to eat less or make better
food choices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lichtenstein also said she doubted that the study
would have much effect on research into nutritional needs _ and
seemed not altogether unhappy about that.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin remains steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that there's an important message to get to
people,'' he said. ``And that's that they can enjoy good food.''

<P>
   To gauge people's attitudes toward food and health, the
researchers asked some two dozen questions.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed were queried, for example, about which word
they associated with ice cream: delicious or fattening. About 31
percent of Americans chose fattening, compared with fewer than 22
percent of the French.
</P>
<P>
   They were also given the words bread, pasta and sauce, and asked
to pick the one that did not belong. The French, presumably
appalled at the notion of dry noodles, generally gave the boot to
the bread; a somewhat higher number of Americans, dutifully
grouping together their carbohydrates, dispensed with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   People were even asked whether they would take a daily pill
instead of eating if it would safely satisfy their hunger and
nutritional needs. About 26 percent of the Americans said they
would, more than twice the percentage of French.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin, who specializes in the psychology of food (his past work
includes trying to explain the near-mystical allure of chocolate
and why cultures differ on which foods are considered edible and
which are beyond the pale), acknowledged the limits of his study.
He said any number of cultural differences like income and
religion, which people were not queried about, could help explain
the differing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that the ``French paradox'' _ as the
disparity between France's rich diet and general good health is
often called _ may result, as some nutritionists believe, simply
from the fact that the French consume far fewer calories overall
than do Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin said he did not expect mainstream American nutrition
experts to rush to embrace his theory. ``A good part of the
American health community is out to nail foods as good or bad for
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will not be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Lichtenstein, a biochemist and nutritionist at Tufts
University, took issue with both Rozin's research methodology and
his conclusions. ``It's not clear to me that, by encouraging people
to enjoy their food more, they're going to eat less or make better
food choices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lichtenstein also said she doubted that the study
would have much effect on research into nutritional needs _ and
seemed not altogether unhappy about that.
</P>
<P>
   Rozin remains steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that there's an important message to get to
people,'' he said. ``And that's that they can enjoy good food.''

   PONTIAC, Mich. _ To look at a photograph of Nathaniel Abraham is
to search for the face of a child. Nathaniel, 13, was convicted
last week for planting himself on a hillside in this Detroit
suburb, shooting at a stranger walking out of a convenience store
and killing him _ a crime he committed at the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction for second-degree murder raises questions that go
to the heart of what society would like childhood to be, and what
society believes must be done when a child has acted like the worst
sort of adult.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel, like an increasing number of children across the
country, was tried and convicted as an adult. So was Kip Kinkel,
sentenced Nov. 10 to life in prison without parole for killing his
parents and two classmates in Springfield, Ore., when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   As state after state has lowered the age at which youths can be
treated as legal adults, sentenced to long terms in adult prisons
and even put to death for their crimes, Americans are caught
between two contradictory impulses: to preserve childhood as a time
of innocence and to deny that children who commit crimes are indeed
children.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common lament that children today grow up too fast, that
society is conspiring to deprive them of the halcyon childhood they
deserve. Children today watch television shows and movies saturated
with sexual innuendo and violence. They wear clothes that are
scaled-down copies of adult styles. They engage in sex younger, and
for at least some of those children the rite of losing one's
virginity is increasingly ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Children are also spending less and less time with adults, and
are more often influenced by peers. The result is less guidance on
how to behave like a grown-up, even as there are more pressures to
act like one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet coupled with society's fear of prematurely lost innocence
has been a growing terror of the violent crimes that youngsters _
boys in particular _ are capable of planning and carrying out. At
least 38 people have been killed in a dozen school shootings since
1993, from West Paducah, Ky., to Littleton, Colo. In almost every
case, boys have fired the shots. Such cases have captured the
public's imagination, even though actual arrests of males under age
18 for violent crimes peaked at 151,074 in 1994 and have fallen 26
percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of crime is trumping concern about foreshortened boyhood.
Still, responding to a sharp rise in juvenile crime during the
early 1990s, at least 44 states have adopted new laws since 1992
that allow more children to be tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Many child development experts say this strategy ignores
children's very immaturity. The answer to juvenile crime, they
contend, is to provide more guidance and supervision for all boys,
and more counseling for the emotionally troubled or mentally
impaired, instead of more stringent penalties for boys who step out
of line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we're facing is boys are not being nurtured and
cared for toward adulthood,'' said Michael Gurian, a family
therapist in Spokane, Wash., who has written eight books on male
development. ``They're not being taught to control their emotions,
they're not being taught to be men.''
</P>
<P>
   But this view, which typifies the main current of intellectual
thought about children during the 20th century, seems to be
yielding in the criminal justice system to an older way of thinking
about children, one that views them as little adults.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's first juvenile court was set up 100 years ago in
Chicago to handle children's offenses discreetly and with an
emphasis on rehabilitation. Before then, the few youths who
committed serious crimes were often treated as small but errant
adults and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, children were treated as adults in many ways throughout
most of history. They were expected to work from an early age,
toiling alongside their parents in mines and in sweatshops.
Historian Philippe Aries has said children were not even recognized
as distinct from adults until the 17th century. The romanticization
of childhood as a time of innocence really took flight in Victorian
England, along with laws restricting child labor. Then came the
notion of a separate track for children in the criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity attending what seems like an endless series of
horrific incidents involving youngsters has contributed to the
current willingness to return to the earlier time of treating
children on a par with adults.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cases of Kip Kinkel and Nathaniel Abraham raise
troubling questions because defense psychologists testified that
the boys had emotional difficulties. Kip was said to have told
doctors during his sentencing hearing that since the age of 12 he
had heard voices ordering him to kill. Psychologists said Nathaniel
had below-average intelligence and significant difficulties in
controlling his emotions _ particularly anger.
</P>
<P>
   Child development experts almost invariably agree that
counseling and other intervention should begin early enough to
prevent violent crimes. But opinions diverge on what to do once a
child has committed murder _ particularly after having had many
other contacts with police.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspected Nathaniel in other criminal incidents during
the nearly three years before the 1997 hillside shooting, though no
charges were ever brought. Prosecutors say he has assaulted other
youths at least twice while in custody awaiting his recent trial.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some experts maintain that prolonged confinement is not the
answer. Dr. Aaron R. Kipnis, a clinical psychologist and the author
of a new book, ``Angry Young Men: How Parents, Teachers, and
Counselors Can Help Bad Boys Become Good Men'' (Jossey-Bass), said
his own experience as a troubled youth had persuaded him that long
prison sentences only produce hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the street, I sold drugs, I committed acts of
prostitution, I committed petty thefts,'' Kipnis recalled. But he
said he was able to avoid a life of crime because his sentences
were short and because he received a small grant for college.
</P>
<P>
   Children who receive long jail sentences do not have such an
opportunity to rejoin society, he argues. ``With 10 years in prison
in your youth, you have no education, no job skills, no social
contacts,'' Kipnis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington
University, contends that some children have such a predisposition
for violence that society may not be able to run the risk of
letting them go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to accept there are some we are not going to be able
to save,'' Etzioni said. ``I'd like to see a little society, a
little community like Boys Town, where they can live their lives as
normally as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry about the legal system's growing emphasis on
elaborate trials and harsh punishments for serious juvenile crimes,
often at the expense of prosecuting less serious infractions.
Children too easily learn that they can get away with breaking many
laws, only to face long prison terms when they go too far.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Hymowitz, the author of a new book, ``Ready or Not: Why
Treating Children as Small Adults Endangers Their Future and Ours''
(Free Press), contends that Nathaniel's case, in which several
years of police contacts did not result in any judicial response,
shows the system at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have children hearing adults say clearly and
promptly, `You can't do this,''' she said, ``and the system is too
cumbersome for that. Instead, they get the message that adults are
indifferent, and that's the worst message you can send.''

   WASHINGTON _ There was lots of news on the campaign trail last
week, from Texas Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy debut to new
polls in New Hampshire showing a tightening horse race in both
parties. But is anyone paying attention, beyond the rapt little
world of journalists, consultants and political groupies?
</P>
<P>
   A new survey suggests that most Americans are not. When people
weren't prompted with a list of candidates, which is routinely done
in political polls, nearly two-thirds said they did not have a
favorite. More than 8 in 10 did not know whether former Sen. Bill
Bradley advocated government-paid health insurance for low-income
people. (He does.) Nearly 8 in 10 had no idea whether Sen. John
McCain supported or opposed an overhaul of the campaign finance
system. (He supports it.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds said they found the previous campaign week
``boring,'' and only a quarter found it ``informative,'' according
to the poll, which was conducted Nov. 10 to 14 for Harvard's
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The public is rarely engaged in a presidential campaign this
early, but many experts warn that Americans are growing
increasingly detached from the political process in more
fundamental ways. Turnout in the 1998 midterm elections was 36.06
percent, the lowest level since 1942, when millions of Americans
were away at war, according to Curtis Gans, an analyst with the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Turnout among
young people is particularly ominous: just 11 percent of 18- and
19-year-olds voted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is longstanding _ in the 1960 presidential election,
62.8 percent of the voting age population turned out; in 1996, 49
percent did _ and has to do with sweeping changes in American
society, Gans argues.
</P>
<P>
   These include the loss of public trust in politicians during the
Vietnam and Watergate years; the rise of an often corrosive new
campaign technology; the creation of ``something beyond
skepticism,'' as Gans puts it, among the journalists who report
about politics; and a decline in basic civic values that becomes
self-perpetuating.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some analysts say, the 2000 campaign has the potential
to feed this disaffection. Front-runners have been declared and
fields winnowed, largely on the basis of fund-raising prowess,
while most Americans were looking elsewhere, underscoring the image
of politics as an insiders game. And ahead lies a primary and
caucus schedule so compressed that it could well pass most voters
in a confusing blur.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to engage voters, as debates have done in the
general election, says Thomas Patterson, a Harvard professor and
co-director of the Shorenstein Center poll, the first in a series
called the Vanishing Voter Project. But changing political
calendars and campaigns is notoriously hard, and renowned for
unintended consequences.

polls that his aides say he can recite, from memory, the American
people's double-digit tastes on a wide array of issues. Besides
using survey data to help shape some of the most important
decisions of his presidency, Clinton has also consulted polls
before deciding whether his family should go to the beach or the
mountains on their summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Most infamously, Dick Morris, his former political adviser,
testified that Clinton asked him to conduct a secret, overnight
poll to determine whether Americans were prepared to hear the truth
about his affair with a 21-year-old intern inside the White House.
Morris said that after taking the survey, he told the president:
``You can't tell them about it. They'll kill you. They're just not
ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we just have to win, then,'' Clinton replied. It was
Morris' poll that helped persuade the president to deceive his
family, his aides and the public for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the few hundred people who answered Morris' poll determined
a critical presidential decision,'' wrote Arianna Huffington, the
conservative columnist who has crusaded for years against
politicians' devotion to polls by urging people to refuse to
respond to pollsters' questions. Ms. Huffington described the White
House sex scandal as ``the first political crisis to be so entirely
driven and shaped by polls,'' asserting that it was the president's
consistently high approval ratings that spared him from removal
from office by the Senate in February.
</P>
<P>
   This vigilant reliance on poll numbers by the president and most
politicians raises an important public policy question: Who
actually talks to pollsters and who does not?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, is troubling news for the polling
industry and the people who rely on the numbers: Far fewer people
agree to participate in surveys than just 10 years ago, a fact that
some critics call the industry's ``dirty little secret,'' because
most polling firms refuse to divulge their surveys' refusal rates.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is especially important in the current presidential
campaign, with a newly front-loaded primary calendar that makes
polls more crucial to candidates' fortunes than ever. Already, some
candidates have cited their own discouraging poll numbers and the
subsequent lack of financial support as reason enough to drop out
of the race, months before the first primary ballot is cast.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ever-rising number of opinion polls and
telemarketing phone calls _ and no doubt to the increasing
disengagement of people from politics _ more and more people simply
refuse to be questioned. Lately the trend has raised alarms among
pollsters and social scientists, who are starting to question the
validity of many surveys conducted for politicians and the media.
</P>
<P>
   And doubts about polls can only increase with the rise of
Internet polling (which Morris, among others, is trying to
promote). Internet polling raises obvious questions of methodology,
in part because respondents are self-selected and come only from
the population subset of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional polling, falling response rates, as they are
called in the trade, are a ``terrible, terrible problem,'' said
pollster Everett Ladd, director of the Roper Center. Even gauging
it is a challenge, given the reluctance of polling firms and media
organizations to routinely disclose response rates.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say response rates have fallen as low as 20 percent in
some recent polls, which means that as many as 8 out of 10 people
initially asked to participate in a poll refused to be interviewed.
Ten years ago, polling response rates were typically at least 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One media pollster attributes the growing number of refusals to
the public's weariness with aggressive telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is always trying to sell you something on the
phone,'' said the pollster, who insisted on anonymity. ``Most
refusals come within the first 30 seconds, when people are not
certain it is a legitimate poll. They usually assume it is just
another attempt to sell them something.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the problem, an International Conference on
Survey Non-Response was convened last month in Portland, Oregon. It
was attended by 500 pollsters, marketing professionals and
academics, who spent several days grappling with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have money to spend, you can still get quite high
response rates,'' said Robert Groves, a professor at the University
of Michigan who chaired the conference in Portland. But the
national polls conducted for large media outlets with limited
budgets often cut too many corners to produce results in just a few
days, experts argue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the political polls taken by news organizations,
including The New York Times/CBS News poll, struggle to persuade
people to participate. (The Times doesn't publish its response
rates, which vary but generally match the long-term trend. It has
provided them upon request to journalists from other news
organizations.)
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars are concerned that the public's diverse
demographics aren't being reflected in poll results.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The data are pretty clear that you miss people who live alone,
especially younger people who are more likely to be out in the
evenings,'' Groves said. ``You tend to over-sample people with
young children because they are home. You also tend to
over-interview the elderly population because they are at home and
are often willing to be polled. You get the unemployed. It's an odd
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll with the highest response rate is the monthly
unemployment survey conducted by the government. The survey result
is a key economic indicator _ last week it prompted the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates _ so it better be reliable. And
scholars generally agree that it is, largely because the survey's
response rate is between 94 and 96 percent. The survey's pollsters
interview 40,000 people across the country over a 10-day period.
Studies show that people are much more willing to respond to a poll
conducted by the government than by the media or a private firm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huffington and other conservative commentators have asserted
that Clinton's enduring high approval ratings result from a
political bias in polls conducted for the national media. In 1996,
these critics complained that the polls often overstated Clinton's
lead over Republican nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press studied
this question and found little evidence of political bias in
national political polls. The study also considered the criticism
that quick media polls often miss some people.
</P>
<P>
   The center took two surveys _ one that contacted 1,000 adults by
phone in a five-day survey, and a more elaborate one over eight
weeks, which included advance letters announcing that a poll-taker
would be calling and offers of a small monetary gift in return for
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, 79 percent of the people contacted in
the more rigorous survey agreed to be interviewed, while only 65
percent agreed to participate in the five-day telephone survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as it turned out,'' the center reported, `the standard and
rigorous surveys produced strikingly similar results.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Pew Center findings suggest that the non-response issue
could be addressed with polls that adhere to rigorous standards and
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, academics, social scientists and even politicians
are becoming more vocal about their distaste for politicians who
vote according to polls rather than their consciences.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., recently decried
politicians' addiction to poll results, suggesting that it had
caused Congress to adopt popular causes, like the line-item veto,
that were later found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.
``We've lost our sense of ideas that we stand by, principles that
are important to us,'' Moynihan said in an interview with ABC News
anchor Peter Jennings, which was published in the periodical
Civilization. ``We've got very near to becoming careless with the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings asked, ``Do you think that, in some respect, polls have
contributed, as I think I detect on occasion, to a lack of
confidence in politicians in their own deliberative thinking
process?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Moynihan replied, ``I think you wouldn't be mistaken,
as a citizen, to ask: Are we really necessary?''

   MOSCOW _ Just for a moment, imagine the corked-up fury of life
in a failed superpower, a place where the government seems impotent
and scandal-scarred; where the army is demoralized by defeat and
incompetence; where the economy seems to rock between inflation and
depression. Then imagine that Islamic terrorists from
magnifying-glass specks on the map are blowing up your citizens,
seemingly with impunity. If you lived there, it might feel good to
hit back, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is one way to view, though not to condone, Russia's brutish
efforts to subdue its runaway province of Chechnya, a blunt-edged
assault that is messily wiping out civilians and soldiers alike,
drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation, working quite
well, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Americans cannot truly imagine Russians' frustration at their
imperial disintegration and economic collapse. But perhaps they can
get a whiff of the emotional release Chechnya evokes among Russians
by recalling how good it felt, after two decades of Vietnam,
Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to finally regain their military
prowess _ striking back first at Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then,
far more dramatically, against Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to that time: The notion that the United States was
back, a force not to be messed with, was almost palpable. American
approval was tinged with jingoism; ``Vietnam syndrome'' was
declared dead. Now, after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's defiant
speech to a gathering of Europe's and America's leaders in Istanbul
last week and the Russian military's vow to ignore the world's
carping about its tactics in Chechnya, it seems conceivable that
post-Soviet Russia has reached a similar turning point in its brief
history.
</P>
<P>
   Similar, but not identical. Unlike America, the Bear isn't back.
And Russia these days is truly reeling, socially and economically,
as America never did. In all probability, it is decades away from
reclaiming the world stage. Still, a powerful backlash is beginning
to coil, a Slavic jingoism born in desperation, fed by resentment
of Western might and exploited by even the most liberal Russian
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   This is the context in which the Kremlin, eyeing the
presidential election next June, is casting the war as a Russian
wake-up call _ a ``don't tread on me'' warning to domestic bandits
and foreign critics alike, from a people whose faces are black with
heel marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those early signs of being Westernized, they were all
superficial,'' said Leonid Sedov, an analyst with Moscow's Public
Opinion Foundation, in an interview. ``What's happening is that
Russia is taking her own special course, and it's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   All these themes, and more, are braided in Chechnya. The
military was mortified there in 1996 after the Kremlin yanked it
out before it could be decimated by urban guerrillas in the streets
of Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The current war offers generals the chance to wipe that slate
clean and regain a measure of influence in Yeltsin's weakened
government.
</P>
<P>
   Military policy-makers are bristling over U.S. attempts to fill
the power vacuum along the old Soviet Union's shrunken borders.
NATO's three-month bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last spring
was, in retrospect, a fault line in relations between the two
countries. Chechnya provides a chance to reassert Russian military
strength in its own backyard, and to show that Moscow will not
surrender its old spheres of influence so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign-policy strategists here have abandoned the gauzy notion
of a decade ago that Moscow and Washington would together make the
world safe for democracy; now they see the West mostly as a rival,
if not a threat. Nowhere was that clearer than last week in
Istanbul where, as Western leaders condemned Chechnya misdeeds in
one hall, President Clinton watched in another as several former
Soviet states signed a deal for a new oil pipeline that would
circumvent Russian pipelines and their tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   To Russian foreign-policy-makers, subduing Chechnya keeps Russia
in the pipeline game, since a stable Chechnya is central to
building new routes nearby or enlarging pipelines already in the
area. And it allows the Kremlin to return the thumb in the eye that
it clearly believes has been delivered by America and its allies on
issues from pipelines to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   To the political elite, Chechnya is as much electoral as
military strategy. Given a chance to wave Russia's tricolor instead
of lamenting its decline, virtually every politician in the nation
has closed ranks behind the Kremlin and against its foreign
human-rights critics.

Grigory Yavlinsky, suggested a negotiated Chechen peace earlier

<P>

violations and the extermination of terrorists is not so much
artificial as nonexistent. True, ordinary Russians opposed the last
assault on Chechnya, in 1994, as a cruel waste of lives and money.
But now it is an issue of self-defense: Chechen bandits invaded the
province of Dagestan last summer, seeking to extend their reach,

up apartment houses and barracks across Russia, killing hundreds of
innocents. No one in Russia expects such a war to be played by

the mood for Russia's current attitude toward Chechnya. Conflict
there may have been unavoidable; Islamic militants effectively gave
the Kremlin and its armies a choice of fighting or losing both
territory and Russia's honor. But both the rules of the battle and
the mentality of its leaders have been molded by NATO's relentless
bombing of Yugoslavia last spring _ opening an East-West rift that
U.S. diplomats then predicted would soon be papered over, but that
has only yawned wider in the intervening months.

<P>
   In Russia, the Kosovo war is remembered as a conflict NATO
launched in utter disregard of Moscow's emotional pleas and

cold shoulder, ignoring Western pleas to mediate and even to
closely observe the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Russian eyes, Moscow's day-and-night bombardment of
Chechen targets mirrors NATO's round-the-clock raids, save the
smart bombs and accurate missiles that minimized civilian Yugoslav
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Russia denounced as war crimes the civilian deaths that
did occur, from errant NATO missiles or bombs that hit refugee
sites. Now those same horrors have become justification for
ignoring complaints about Chechen civilian casualties. More than
200,000 Chechens have fled their homes, and Chechen officials say
more than 4,000 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Russia is insensitive to those complaints, or at
least to their effect on domestic politics. In fact, the Kremlin
has tightly manipulated news coverage here, calling the war an
``anti-terrorist action,'' restricting live coverage and playing
down stories of civilian suffering.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sedov's own polls show some softening of public
backing for the conflict in recent weeks, Russians' thirst for a
victory to celebrate seems apparent: whereas half the population
supported giving Chechnya independence four years ago, 8 in 10 now
support the Kremlin's battle plans.
</P>
<P>
   More revealing, perhaps, is the response to the question of
whether Russia must reinstate itself as a ``great empire;'' 85
percent said yes, and 7 percent no.

   Build a Better Mouse, and . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is death inevitable? Biologists who study aging are beginning to
suspect that the final curtain may at least be postponable. The raw
material of living cells is very robust. It is just that the
evolutionary forces that shape it have no incentive to make a
mouse, say, live forever, when hawks, cats and disease will let the
luckiest mouse survive for only a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now Italian researchers report they have made mice live 30
percent longer than usual by deleting part of a gene. The gene
makes a protein with a deadly role. When cells are damaged by free
radicals, dangerous chemicals generated by ordinary metabolism, the
protein triggers a self-destruct mechanism that forces the stricken
cell to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   This hair-trigger response must benefit animals during
development because it zaps any cell in danger of becoming
cancerous. But the organs of older animals may start to run out of
spare cells, and could probably make good use of the slightly
damaged cells killed off by the trigger protein. That is presumably
why the Italian mice genetically incapable of making the protein
lived longer.
</P>
<P>
   People have a version of the gene the Italians manipulated.
Experts say it should be fairly easy to make a drug that inhibits
the trigger protein made by the gene.
</P>
<P>
   So will that bump the average life span to 100? Doubtless some
Catch-22 will emerge to thwart this scheme, but it is surely
comforting to know someone is working on the death problem.

   History Stumbles Again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's a one-sentence history of the American West in the late
1800s? The politically correct answer, of course, is that the white
man came in and wrecked everything.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Well, yes and no. There can be little doubt of the
horrors visited upon American Indians by expansion-minded folks
from across the Mississippi. But what of that other staple of
Western lore _ the near-extinction of the noble buffalo, symbol of
all that is rugged, shaggy and free, by greedy white hunters? It
might be time to rethink that one.
</P>
<P>
   New studies suggest other culprits. First, a centuries-long cold
snap ended about 1850 _ weather that had nourished the grass that
buffaloes eat. Home on the range was also home, by mid-century, to
some 2 million horses, descendants of a long-ago gift of the
Spaniards. The grazing wasn't easy. And Indians, once they had
guns, hunted countless buffaloes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   White hunters  &UR; did &LR;  do their part, slaughtering millions of
buffaloes in the 1870s and 1880s, but many historians now say this
was merely the final blow _ the buffalo was already doomed.

   Movement Toward Peace In Northern Ireland
</P>
<P>
   The politicians of Northern Ireland have never had problems
talking. For five years they have been at it, in marathon
negotiating sessions seeking a lasting peace plan. But this time
the words were different _ conciliatory, accommodating and thought
out _ where before they had always been obdurate, insulting and
impulsive.
</P>
<P>
   First George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator turned Ulster
mediator, spoke, then John de Chastelain, a retired Canadian
general who heads a panel on disarmament, then David Trimble,
leader of the Ulster Unionists, and his rival party leader, Sinn
Fein's Gerry Adams, and finally _ and most important _ the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographed statements proposed a series of interlocking
steps that would allow the start-up of a new Northern Ireland
government and the simultaneous appointment of an IRA officer as a
representative to the disarmament panel. The formula seeks to get
around a stalemate over guerrilla weapons that has stalled progress
in putting the April 1998 peace settlement into operation.
</P>
<P>
   If Trimble can get backing for the deal at a party meeting in
Belfast next weekend, the new Ulster home rule government, with its
powers divided evenly between Protestants and Catholics, could be
up and running just days later.

   Air Crash Sets Off An Ambiguous Probe
</P>
<P>
   An informal axiom among aviation investigators is that if you
don't know the reason for a crash within the first three days, you
are in for a long haul. But three weeks after Egyptair 990 plunged
toward the water so fast that people inside were weightless,
investigators cannot demonstrate why _ although some theorized from
cockpit conversations that a reserve pilot may have intentionally
set the plane on its plunge toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   So the investigators laid out a plan that will take weeks or
months to raise a substantial part of the Boeing 767 from more than
250 feet of water, twice as deep as Swissair 111 or TWA 800. The
flight data recorder shows a plane that flew ``straight as an
arrow,'' as one crash specialist put it, until it plunged, but the
cockpit voice recorder is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Every crash yields new safety measures, and one has already been
proposed for this crash: adding cameras to the microphones and data
recorders that monitor cockpits.

but one-third of 84 patients who had failed to respond to other

people in northwestern Turkey. Three days before Clinton arrived,
another struck the same region and left more than 675 dead.

awed by the emotion he seemed to show while visiting earthquake

announced a new use for it, as a treatment for multiple myeloma, a
rare bone cancer. They tested thalidomide at the urging of a New
York lawyer whose husband was dying of myeloma. It didn't help him,
but one-third of 84 patients who had failed to respond to other
therapies improved, and two went into complete remission.

   Banks won a victory in their effort to stamp out a spreading
uprising against fees charged for use of automated teller machines.
A federal judge in California, saying such regulation is the
purview of the federal government, blocked San Francisco and Santa
Monica from enforcing the nation's first two local laws banning
such surcharges. But with the fees having touched a public nerve,
the issue is not likely to die. For example, New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone said he intended to press ahead to enact a
similar ordinance.

   Clinton at Quake Sites
</P>
<P>
   Still reeling from the effects of two strong earthquakes in
three months, Turkey gave a warm welcome to President Clinton when
he arrived three days before a summit meeting in Istanbul of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and spent the
time touring the country.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, a devastating quake killed more than 17,000
people in northwestern Turkey. Three days before Clinton arrived,
another struck the same region and left more than 675 dead.
</P>
<P>
   On his tour, the president left behind hosts of admirers, some
awed by the emotion he seemed to show while visiting earthquake
survivors and others impressed by his clear advocacy of greater
political freedom there.
</P>
<P>
   Then he traveled on to Greece, where violent protests against
his visit were staged. Many Greeks believe Clinton is guilty of
crimes against Serbia, which they consider a friendly neighbor.

   Rosa Parks was voted a medal by Congress last spring for having

back of a bus in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. But when Outkast, a rap

epithets, she sued in federal court, contending that her name was
being exploited for commercial gain. A judge ruled against her,
finding that the First Amendment protected the group.

   Congress Passes a Budget
</P>
<P>
   Fifty days after the new fiscal year began, Congress completed
work on a budget that totals about $610 billion. For the second
consecutive year, the budget broke the spending limits that
lawmakers had set for themselves. It includes $17 billion more for
the military and $2.3 billion more for medical research than last
year, even as it frees money to pay $351 million of $926 million in
back dues to the United Nations and offers 41 of the world's
poorest countries some relief from their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had sought the military and medical research funds,
while President Clinton had sought the U.N. and debt relief money.
Clinton also is getting most of the funds he sought for hiring
primary school teachers and local police officers.

<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL BRUS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first weekend talk show appearance -- on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' -- George W. Bush touched on foreign policy, health care,
Social Security and sex education, among ther issues.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, he said the Somalia and Haiti invasions would
not have happened under his watch. When host Tim Russert reminded
him that his father had initiated the Somalia intervention, George
W. simply reasserted that he would not intervene on humanitarian
grounds, except in rare circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went out of his way to emphasize the need for a ``theater
antimissile defense system'' -- both for the U.S. and Taiwan. He
downplayed the importance of arms control, stressing instead the
need for nonproliferation, antimissile systems and the safe storage
of existing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to increase military salaries and military R&AMP;D
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Clinton administration had been too supportive of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Bush replied cryptically, ``That's
going to be an interesting debate in the fall campaign if I'm the
nominee, let me just put it to you that way. We'll find out about
Victor Chernomyrdin and the (U.S.) vice president and the
relationship they have.''
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Bush supported allowing a patient to sue her HMO
if an independent review board decided she had a reasonable
dispute. (This position is more lawsuit-friendly than the House GOP
leadership.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Social Security, George W. indicated a willingness
to raise the current benefit-receiving age. (Responding to Bush on
CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Steve Forbes advocated transforming Social
Security into ``personal savings accounts,'' which would allow
recipients to choose their own retirement age.)
</P>
<P>
   When Russert read a Naomi Wolf quote advocating that sex
education instructors promote fondling and mutual masturbation as
an alternative to sex, Bush said Wolf's advice was ``pathetic,''
said condom promotion hadn't decreased teen pregnancy rates, and
advocated teaching abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits -- such as Tucker Carlson (``Late Edition''), Bob
Novak (CNN's ``Capital Gang,'' and Mark Shields (``Capital Gang'')
-- felt that the GOP caved to the Democrats on important budget
issues, like tax cuts and across-the-board spending cuts. Paul
Gigot (PBS's ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'') noted that spending in
this year's budget had grown at twice the rate of inflation since
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some, such as Kate O'Beirne (``Capital Gang'') argued that
Republicans reined in the Clinton administration's spending
requests, kept Social Security funds intact, and prevented the
subsidization of international abortion providers through the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most pundits continued to be pessimistic about Hillary Clinton's
chances against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Al Hunt (``Capital
Gang'') said her campaign needs a James Carville figure to rev
things up, and Mark Shields (``Capital Gang'') said she had an
uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos (ABC's ``This Week'') said focus groups
show that the voters wish there were different candidates running.
O'Beirne predicted Hillary will drop out of the race and wondered
how she'll ever be able to run for president if she can't win New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But several shows flashed the results of a New York Post poll
showing Clinton only seven points behind Giuliani; Bill Kristol
(``This Week'') noted that seven points behind--one year before the
election in a Democratic state--is not exactly the kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said
Hillary had ``raised more funds than any candidate for any office
in the nation other than president.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ``This Week'' and ``Late Edition'' reviewed a new Bush
campaign commercial in which George W. pledges to ``restore
dignity'' to the presidency. Kristol noted that the message is not
just anti-Clinton, but also aimed at stealing some of John McCain's
patriotic thunder. Steve Roberts (``Late Edition'') felt that Bush
was alluding to his family's history of honorable public service.

<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hottest celebrity in America is a TV star with no
discernible talent who is 66 years old--that's 462 in TV
years--whose partner is the most detested woman on television, and
whose claims to fame are an evening game show that almost no one
wins (``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'') and a morning talk show
where nothing happens (``Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee''). Yet Regis
Philbin deserves all his acclaim and more.
</P>
<P>
   Regis has not come from nowhere. He has come from everywhere.
Until he hit big with ``Live'' in the late '80s, he was the
quintessential loser, a 25-year also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   A Notre Dame grad and Navy veteran, he got his start in the
early '60s hosting a talk show in San Diego, Calif., and spent the
next quarter century anchoring shows in New York, St. Louis and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, these stints would be interrupted by a shot at the
big time, which Regis would invariably blow. In 1964, he succeeded
Steve Allen as host of Westinghouse's marquee late-night show. It
flopped, and Philbin was dumped for Merv Griffin. In the late '60s,
Philbin spent three years as Joey Bishop's sidekick on another
doomed late-night show. Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' spanked
Bishop in the ratings. In the mid-'70s, Philbin bombed as host of a
couple of game shows. In 1981, he tanked as anchor of a national
morning program.
</P>
<P>
   No one could explain why Regis didn't work. He was too spastic
perhaps--''just a nerve ending'' as Bill Zehme, who co-wrote
Philbin's delightful autobiography, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Regis returned to New York in 1983, took over a morning show,
hooked up with Kathie Lee Gifford (then Kathie Lee Johnson) two
years later, and went national with the show in 1988. ``Live'' has
been a monster hit ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Regis and Kathie Lee quickly became figures of ridicule, the
embodiment of unhip. He was the toothy moron; she, the unbearable
crooner. ``Live'' sounds like a joke, an hour of nothing: 20
minutes of ``host chat'' between Regis and Kathie Lee, celebrity
interviews, lame stunts, a trivia question. Watch it once, and it
seems pathetic. Watch it twice, and you begin to see genius.
</P>
<P>
   As host of ``Live'' (or ``Millionaire,'' or anything else he has
ever done), Regis displays no evident talent. He does not interview
guests well. He does not tell jokes. He lacks empathy. He displays
no particular intelligence. He speaks in a bizarre voice, equal
parts Bronx, sinus, and helium.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he the most watchable person on television? In the
autobiography, ``I'm Only One Man,'' he explains his success this
way: ``I started small and learned to keep it small. Small is
friendlier and more real. Small lasts longer.''
</P>
<P>
   This captures one of Regis' gifts. He has a modest but
captivating comic persona. He is the master of umbrage. Walloped by
a generation of rejection, failure, and sidekickdom, he has
perfected the persona of the aggrieved little guy.
</P>
<P>
   His hyperactivity has mellowed, but not too much. In ``host
chat,'' his specialty, Regis turns the mundane details of his
life--a lost wallet, a urinary-tract problem, a disagreement with
``Live's'' producer--into comic gems. Most performers mask their
insecurity with ego. Regis shares his insecurity. (He can take
offense at anything.) He is cotton candy, spinning TV sugar out of
thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee, endlessly chipper and extra-perfect, serves as
superb foil for Regis' peevishness. He jabs her, mocking her
singing and her tedious stories about her son. She punches right
back. It is an amusingly petty domestic drama, enacted every
morning at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Regis' comic persona reinforces his second gift: a perfect
relationship with the camera. No one talks to the screen better
than Regis. ``He is the last of the true broadcasters who can go on
the air and spout about nothing,'' says Zehme. ``He is never at a
loss to speak to the camera as if it were you.'' This is one reason
why David Letterman, Larry King, and other TV celebs idolize Reege.
</P>
<P>
   Regis seems genuine on camera in part because his personality
and TV persona have joined. Profiles of Philbin are tedious because
he has revealed everything on the show (his latest squabble with
his wife, etc.). There is no secret life of Regis Philbin. While
criticizing sensationalistic, confessional talk shows, he divulges
everything about himself. He just doesn't have anything salacious
to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that so many Americans are meeting Regis as the
host of ``Millionaire.'' Though ``Millionaire'' has brought ABC its
first sweeps win since, oh, the 19th century, the show does not do
Regis justice. He is a creature of sunny day, not shadowy night. He
is restrained on `Millionaire,'' forbidden to indulge in his
stories, ad-libs, and insults.
</P>
<P>
   His job is to make the contestants sweat, but he's no good at
it. He's too light to play the heavy. The dark suits he wears make
him look like a lounge singer, not an enforcer. His voice cannot
convey menace. His attempts to daunt contestants are more genial
than ominous (although ``Is that your final answer?'' has become a
national catchphrase).
</P>
<P>
   And Regis certainly doesn't exude the Olympian wisdom you'd
expect from the host. He often seems more surprised to learn the
answer than the contestants do.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Reege may be the ideal game show host for this ironic
age: He allows the show to be both deadly serious and parody.
``Millionaire'' is portentously heavy, yet run by a man with no
gravitas. It concerns itself with something that matters--a million
bucks--yet Regis' presence makes it frivolous. With a somber host,
``Millionaire;; would be oppressive. Thanks to Regis, it is the
perfect '90s experience: You can enjoy it as challenge, kitsch, or
both.

   1. HOW DID REGIS PHILBIN BECOME THE MOST WATCHABLE PERSON ON TV?
by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   The hottest celebrity in America is a TV star with no
discernible talent who is 66 years old--that's 462 in TV
years--whose partner is the most detested woman on television, and
whose claims to fame are an evening game show that almost no one
wins and a morning talk show where nothing happens. Yet Regis
Philbin deserves all his acclaim and more.

   3. BILL BRADLEY'S NAOMI WOLF, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Al Gore isn't the only candidate with a guru.
Bill Bradley has one too, a Harvard professor by the name of Cornel
West. While West is not being paid by the Bradley campaign, as
Naomi Wolf is by Gore's campaign, he plays an analogous role as
affiliated intellectual. Where Wolf advises Gore about how to score
with women voters, West is helping Bradley appeal to blacks. And as
in the Gore-Wolf case, the benefits of the Bradley-West
relationship are clearly reciprocal.

<P>
   Like his past careers as Bill Clinton's savior, confessor,
accuser, and pundit-translator, Dick Morris' latest incarnation as
Internet democracy-builder is an act. He's not building direct
democracy with his vote.com Web site. He's building a rather
different political system, which might more aptly be called
dickmorrisy.

</P>
<P>
   Twenty of history's greatest basketball players headlined a
Madison Square Garden fund-raiser for Bill Bradley last Sunday. The
event, complete with cheerleaders, movie stars, and lights and
music reminiscent of an NBA game, enthralled the press. But Bradley
has pitched himself as a man of substance in a world corrupted by
glitz. So it's worth asking whether the jocks' media blitz for
Bradley, punctuated by their full-court press on Sunday's political
talk shows, conveyed anything of substance.

   6. THE DEMISE OF `ULTIMATE FIGHTING' by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club,'' a movie about a fictional organization of men
who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than
its share of media hand-wringing. It has not, however, sparked an
iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and
beat each other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's
flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy
of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness, heavy-handed
politics, and cultural myopia.

 &HT;    Stand up for nerd gear, Al Gore!
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ As if he hasn't caught enough ridicule for
his unfortunate choice of image advisers, Vice President Al Gore
now is being razzed for his hand-held computer. It's so unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Most accounts of Gore opening his headquarters in Nashville,
Tenn.,
</P>
<P>
   mentioned it, at least in passing, as a quirky detail on a
person
</P>
<P>
   maddeningly free of quirky details. The Washington Post noted
the
</P>
<P>
   accessory under the headline: ``Nerd Alert?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dubious about the earth-toned suit at the New
Hampshire
</P>
<P>
   debate, and now we're starting to wonder about the Palm Pilot
Vice
</P>
<P>
   President Gore insists on clipping to his belt,'' the Reliable
Source
</P>
<P>
   column said. ``What's next _ a plastic pocket protector?''
</P>
<P>
   You would think we as a people would have progressed beyond such
crude cultural stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   And it is untrue on several counts. For one thing, because of
the unjust stigma they carry, it's now all but impossible to find
pocket protectors. Just try.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, palm computers are not badges of nerdhood. I
use one myself.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe a stronger counterargument is called for. I admit I
also wore a digital watch back when they were the size of hockey
pucks. But palm computers are different. Really.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to Gore is not to listen to this petty sneering. A man
with a palm computer on his belt strides with confidence. The
gizmos have a comforting feel and flip open like a communicator on
the classic episodes of ``Star Trek.'' They can do the work of a $2
road map, a 99-cent pen, a $10 clock, a $6.50 paperback, a $3
</P>
<P>
   address book, a $1.50 notepad and a 35-cent newspaper _ all in
one $180 package!
</P>
<P>
   They can hold maps, books, address books, to-do lists, e-mail,
calculators that turn miles into meters and even into microns if
you're interested (I commute 8 billion microns to work!), a chess
program that always beats me; periodic, sun, moon, tide and guitar-
</P>
<P>
   chord tables, and the U.S. Constitution, New Testament,
Shakespeare's sonnets and Tao-te Ching all displayed in tiny,
jagged letters.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Swiss Army knife of data retrieval. Nerd alert,
indeed!
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, not everyone is convinced. Even the makers of the devices
seem to be fleeing from the nerd label. Advertisements for
hand-helds show fast-lane executives and shapely women using them.
People whose lives are so fast-paced, glamorous and intense that
they require high-tech help.
</P>
<P>
   It's as though they are ashamed of consumers like me, people who
use it to enter orthodontist appointments, detention schedules, car
mechanic numbers and to-do lists that chronicle the gradual
breakdown of house and garden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their gee-whiz capabilities, the neatest thing about
palm computers is their aid to mobile and compulsive readers.
People who, if without a newspaper or book, read cereal boxes for
breakfast and the chemical makeup of sweetener packs over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   With these little computers, you can hold the equivalent of a
book bag in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you do have to squint sometimes and the type may be little
and jiggy, but mobile readers are used to discomfort. People who
lug brick-sized books on planes and buses trade weight for
eyestrain and find it a liberating deal.
</P>
<P>
   I urge the vice president not to flee the nerd label. He should
keep the Palm Pilot on his belt and use it to record the name of
anyone who laughs.
</P>
<P>
   This nation has a proud history of nerd-presidents _ James
Madison, John Quincy Adams, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter all
fall into this category. Gore should lay claim to this tradition.
</P>
<P>
   By listening to his inner nerd _ and then maybe recording the
monologue on his hand-held computer _ the vice president could
attract the sizable nerd vote and project a new authenticity to
everyone else. Here is a man who doesn't try to hide his digital
watch or sensible shoes and can instantly calculate a 20 percent
tip no matter how many people are at the table.
</P>
<P>
   How can people fail to respond to that?
</P>
<P>
   Keep your portable computer strapped on, Al. The advisers who
tell you otherwise are just jealous they can't work one.

 &HT;    Coming together on `Dannsgiving'
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Invariably, when I reflect on Thanksgivings
past, my memory locks in on a unique celebration that took place
over 25 years ago in the small Georgia town my young son Kristofor
and I called home at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was Thanksgiving eve and a group had gathered at Kate's house
for one of
</P>
<P>
   our ``just getting together for no reason'' evenings that
invariably ended up with someone playing the piano and the rest
singing show tunes and ignoring the fact that a couple of us had a
range of four notes, two of which were flat. Eventually, the
conversation switched from music to food _ as it always did.
</P>
<P>
   Dann was the first to admit he had no Thanksgiving Day plans. As
it turned
</P>
<P>
   out, neither did the rest of us. Wendell was going to eat peanut
butter and bologna and watch football games; Peggy had been
thinking about driving into Atlanta for a movie. Kate had a
brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a commercial-size kitchen out there, and a dining table
that will
</P>
<P>
   seat all of us and then some. Be a shame to let it go to waste,
wouldn't it?'' was how she worded her invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us jumped at the offer and set about planning the
menu. ``Cornbread stuffing,'' was Dann's first choice. Betty Jane
added sweet potato
</P>
<P>
   souffle to the list. We were well into the pumpkin pie before
Susan brought us up short. ``Who knows how to cook a turkey?''
</P>
<P>
   We confessed. Not one of us had ever even watched somebody else
prepare a
</P>
<P>
   turkey much less cooked one ourselves. Enthusiasm waned with the
realization there was not a real cook among us.
</P>
<P>
   We were a glum group, feeling sorrier for ourselves by the
minute, but Kate
</P>
<P>
   insisted we would not be split up for Thanksgiving dinner. We
were in this
</P>
<P>
   thing together, she said, even if it meant grilled cheese and
canned tomato soup. Kristofor said that sounded good to him, and an
idea was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not celebrate an all new kind of Thanksgiving?'' Dann
asked. ``Why don't we each cook our favorite dish in Kate's
kitchen?'' Unanimous approval and Kate even suggested we make a
list of folks who might like to join us, warning them first that
our feast would not be a traditional one.
</P>
<P>
   Hank, the town barber, was happy to be invited and said he'd
bring corn
</P>
<P>
   pudding. Mr. Johnson, a bachelor recently retired from the local
department store, volunteered to do the souffle. Carly was thrilled
to be called because she and her two sons had just moved down from
Indiana and had no family in town. She brought Waldorf salad.
Josephine signed up for gnocchi _ a recipe from her hometown in
northern Italy. And so it went. We kept calling folks until every
chair was filled _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Jane worked on the menu and each of us made a list of the
ingredients we had on hand and what we needed from the store.
Wendell and Dann headed for Atlanta in search of an all-night
market while the rest of us dug through the pantry for linens and
dishes, silverware and candlesticks, and anything else we
</P>
<P>
   could find to lay a festive table. Way in the back of a cupboard
we found a chipped ceramic chicken that had belonged to Kate's
mother. Perfect for the centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   It was barely daybreak when we began filtering into the
old-fashioned kitchen. We helped ourselves to coffee and set to
work. There were the expected disasters _ dropped eggs, spilled
sauces, and too many cooks stumbling over one another, but by 4
o'clock that afternoon, the feast was ready and 23 diverse souls
ringed the table loaded with the fruits of a day's labor.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell prayed, and Dann proposed a toast to our originality.
</P>
<P>
   When we left Kate's later that evening, it was with far more
than a full stomach and a bowl of leftovers. In fact, we all felt
so good about our
</P>
<P>
   special holiday we renamed it in honor of its founder _
``Dannsgiving.''

 &HT;    Cool planet makes for a hot online topic
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mars is just a bright dot in the sky on a starry
night, but personal computers and the Internet have brought the Red
Planet as close as your keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Most space missions now have at least one, and sometimes many,
Internet sites, and the large number of missions aimed at Mars in
recent years has caused a proliferation of sites for the fourth
rock from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, charged with an educational mission and always savvy about
marketing, has put vast quantities of information online, from raw
scientific data to glitzy pictures and animations. Private groups,
particularly the Mars Society, have used the Internet and e-mail to
reach millions of potential supporters in their grass-roots
campaigns to mount human expeditions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, television was the medium that brought the
Apollo moon landings into our living rooms with grainy,
black-and-white, but live images of Neil Armstrong taking the first
step onto the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, anyone with Internet access can view the latest color
pictures from Mars orbit, click on a browsable atlas to zoom in on
almost any spot on Mars, or download 3D images of the Martian
surface.
</P>
<P>
   If mouse clicks were votes, the exploration of Mars would be an
even bigger program than Apollo. When Mars Pathfinder landed in
1997, its Internet site recorded more than 700 million visits. NASA
scrambled to set up duplicate ``mirror'' sites on servers around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario may repeat itself Dec. 3 when the Mars Polar
Lander is scheduled to touch down near Mars' South Pole. It doesn't
carry a rover, as Pathfinder did, but the polar landscape is likely
to offer surprising new scenery. Mirror sites of the polar lander
Internet site have been set up for the expected flood of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Zubrin, founder of the Mars Society and guru of the Mars
exploration movement, has used the Internet to broaden his crusade.
Downloadable slide shows are available to illustrate his plan for
sending an expedition to Mars within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Zubrin's Mars Society went from a founding convention
in August to an international organization with chapters around the
world, thanks in part to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tamarack R. Czarnik, a medical doctor in Wright State
University's aerospace medicine program, said e-mail helped him
organize the society's Ohio chapter almost immediately after the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Like the parent organization, the chapter distributes a biweekly
electronic newsletter. About 120 people around Ohio subscribe to
it, including 40 paid members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czarnik said the interactive nature of e-mail has spurred
involvement at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on a daily basis, but certainly on a weekly basis I get
comments from people'' who receive his newsletter, he said. He also
mails out a traditional paper version of the newsletter, but he
gets noticeably less response from that medium, he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the warmth and comfort of a home or office PC, the Martian
landscape looks almost Earth-like, with a sunny sky and rocky
terrain not unlike some areas of the American Southwest. It's hard
to imagine that the picture on your screen has come from that
little point of light in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   At its closest approach, Mars is more than 100 times farther
away than the Moon, and a round trip to Mars would take years
instead of days. Even at the speed of light, signals from Mars
probes take from three to 20 minutes to reach Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there is still a risky business, as the loss of the Mars
Climate Observer spacecraft in September demonstrated. A
miscalculation aimed it too close to Mars; instead of swinging into
orbit, it apparently plunged into the atmosphere and burned.
</P>
<P>
   The polar lander is another risky mission. Engineers recently
discovered that its descent engines, chilled after months in space,
might not work when they're needed. The engineers hope a method
they worked out to warm the engines before firing will solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker James Cameron, a self-declared Mars exploration
``wacko'' who is producing a TV miniseries and an IMAX film about
an expedition to Mars, fears a generation of ``Star Trek'' and
``Star Wars'' has given young people a false impression that space
travel is easy and other planets are hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars is really, really far away, and it's really, really
cold,'' he reminded the crowd at Zubrin's Mars Society convention,
held at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``By showing a commonplace abundance of intelligent humanoid
aliens from all over the galaxy, and interstellar planet hopping in
a matter of days or hours, these fantasies have raised the
expectations of the youthful public to absurd heights which can
never be fulfilled by the realities of space travel,'' Cameron
said. He said his miniseries, depicting an expedition set in the
near future, will be as realistic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   An Earth-like Mars has been a part of popular culture for more
than a century, triggered by American astronomer Percival Lowell's
electrifying reports in the 1890s that canals crisscrossed the Red
Planet's parched landscape. Romantic notions of thirsty Martian
cities drawing water from the polar icecaps fired the imaginations
of writers. Edgar Rice Burroughs penned ``A Princess of Mars'' and
other Martian adventures. H.G. Wells imagined rampaging Martians in
``The War of the Worlds,'' and Ray Bradbury portrayed a wise,
ancient race in ``The Martian Chronicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Lowell was wrong. Mariner 4 shattered the image
of an Earth-like Mars when it swept past the planet in 1965 and
sent back grainy pictures that showed moonlike craters, not canals.
Two Viking landers probed Mars' red soil in 1976 and didn't even
find germs, much less intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   But interest in Mars has been growing again, and probes planned
for the next several years are likely to keep it stoked, with help
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Internet may reach Mars before people do. Vinton
Cerf, a senior vice president at MCI and a developer of the TCP/IP
protocol used to transmit information on the Internet, has been
working on interplanetary data networks with NASA engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Czarnik said an interplanetary Internet may follow in the
footsteps of the old ARPAnet, the precursor of the Internet that
was developed to allow scientists to exchange research data. The
interplanetary version would serve space scientists and might even
allow some to control spacecraft from their keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Czarnik said such an internet won't give the public direct
access to space probes, but it's likely to give individuals an even
more intimate feeling of involvement in deep-space missions, such
as virtual-reality images of Mars or other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever people finally go to Mars, only a select few will get
to make the voyage. But millions may get to tag along vicariously.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP hate for Clinton doomed 106th Congress
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first session of the 106th Congress is petered out in vague
ignominy and ill grace, having fussed much and accomplished little.
But it did do this: It set a new standard for surly partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Congress first wasted months of its time and the nation's
persisting in an impeachment that was obviously doomed from the
first gavel fall, all over a president's attempt to dance _ and
when that wasn't working, to lie _ his way out of admitting to an
affair that didn't even have stylishness to commend it to public
prurience.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to punish President Clinton for besting them, Congress's
Republican leaders spent the rest of the year harrying even his
smallest initiatives and pestering his conduct of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Congress didn't do: It didn't square Social Security
away for the long run. It didn't reform political campaign funding.
It didn't help Medicare seniors cover prescription costs. All three
options were on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it did do: It put anti-environmental riders on just
about every passing piece of legislation. (Clinton used vetoes and
veto threats to unhorse most.) It kited a nearly $800 billion tax
cut that would have overwhelmingly gone to our richest. (The public
yawned. The plan flopped.) It bored new tax loopholes for
big-business political contributors. (See above, ``Campaign funding
reform, failure of.'') And rather than just scraping out-dated
spending caps, it resorted to goofy budget dodges so it could
tender at least meager new support for education, teaching
hospitals and economic development in down-and-out neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The session was mainly marked by the palpable Republican hatred
of Clinton, understandable not because the president is the
scoundrel Republicans insist he is _ mostly he's not _ but because
he has used his superior political skills to put them in one after
another box and to eke out small victories for his own program.
More teachers and cops here, a plan there to protect at least
patches of greenery from development.
</P>
<P>
   Expect nothing better next year. The GOP majorities remain too
thin to dominate. Clinton, facing a no-win game on the Hill, will
concentrate on foreign policy, where he has some maneuvering room.
Both parties will ballyhoo high-profile legislation meant only to
create bugle-call issues for the election. The big, totemistic
Republican initiatives won't survive Clinton's veto. The Democratic
ones won't get out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the nation can expect improvement after that is up to
voters. In one of history's longest-running practical jokes, voters
in the 1980s elected a Republican presidency and Democratic
Congresses; in the '90s, a Democratic presidency and Republican
Congresses.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest bloc was neither Democratic or Republican. It
was no-shows. Nothing in the politics of the two decades enticed
them to polls. Maybe disgust finally will. It should. If so, this
year's Congress can claim a lot of the credit.

 &HT;    You could look it up: Reference tools sharp
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World Wide Web was pretty much a toyland in the
beginning. It was an amazing place to visit in its earliest days.
And almost everything you found there was fascinating and also
without any practical value.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's a very practical world for the most part. It's a
place where you can shop, check the weather, get a quick look at
the traffic you can expect on the way to work and find information
on everything from beekeeping to epoxies.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the handiest uses for the Web, whether you're at work
or doing homework for school, is the way that _ increasingly _ it
can substitute for a whole shelf of reference books. Since many
reference books get dated fast, the Web has real advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some of the places on the Web that _ when
used together _ form a handy collection of reference works.
</P>
<P>
   About the most mundane, and useful, reference book around is the
dictionary. Whether you need help in pronunciation, spelling or
just nailing down the definition of a word, a dictionary is the
anchor for most reference desks. Several sites on the Web offer
dictionaries, but one stands out: Dictionary.com at www
</P>
<P>
   .dictionary.com.
</P>
<P>
   The definitions come from Webster's Revised Unabridged
Dictionary. But there's a lot more on this page than just the
dictionary. You'll find links to Roget's Thesaurus (www.thesaurus
</P>
<P>
   .com if you want to go there directly); to dictionaries in
almost any language you can name; hints on grammar and style for
writers; and even a crossword section where you can put some of
those new words to quick use.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, of course, when a dictionary isn't enough. If
you want to know more about Will Rogers, for instance, you won't
get any help in the dictionary. But there is a great free online
encyclopedia. In fact, it's the online version of one of the best
electronic versions ... Microsoft's Encarta. You'll find it at
encarta.msn.com/. And if you key in the name Will Rogers, you'll
get a brief biography, a photograph and a selection of links that
will take you out into the Web to find out even more.
</P>
<P>
   Reference works aren't limited to dictionaries and
encyclopedias, of course. As the world has grown smaller _ thanks
in part to the Web _ the need has increased to understand people in
other parts of the world. In Europe, for instance, temperatures are
often expressed in Celsius degrees, rather than Fahrenheit, as is
used in most U.S. weather forecasts. To find an instant converter,
just type in the temperature and click the mouse to convert at www
</P>
<P>
   .isotech.co.uk/convert.html.
</P>
<P>
   And if you get an urgent e-mail from a customer who wants one of
those superdeluxe widgets that your company builds and is prepared
to budget up to $8,922 Singapore dollars, you'll know that amounts
to $5,344.46 (on the day this calculation was performed) in U.S.
currency. Most currencies that you've heard of _ and a few that you
haven't _ can be found here at www.asia1.com.sg
</P>
<P>
   /cgi-bin/bt/fxconv.pl.
</P>
<P>
   Translation can be a problem with the language itself, of
course. What if you get an e-mail from an Italian customer who
tells you ``Desidero comprare piu widgets''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's good news. That customer wants to buy more widgets.
You can do the translation yourself at babelfish.altavista
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You'll find help for German, French, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish.

 &HT;    Registering at retail sites can be the path to bargains
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This holiday season when you are shopping online, why
not opt to ``opt in?''
</P>
<P>
   Opting in is a high-tech way of saying that when you visit an
online retailer, you will check the little box on nearly every site
that asks if you'd like to be on its e-mail list.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a lot of people are thinking, ``What, check a box
that says, `Please send more junk mail spam to my e-mail account?'
No way, man.'' There's also an equally large group out there
saying, ``Hey, I value my privacy. I don't want some money-grubbing
retailer knowing everything about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for those two groups, there's just one thing to say: ``Get
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers want to be your friend. Well, they want you to
be their friend, anyway. They've read those Jupiter studies saying
online shoppers are going to leave somewhere in the neighborhood of
$6 billion at online checkout counters this holiday season. The
last thing they want to do is upset you and your disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   While they may wish they could invade your privacy, crawl into
your brain and rewire it so you will buy expensive things from them
in great quantities, they know you'd rather they didn't. They know
most shoppers don't want to give away much more information than an
e-mail address and possibly an area of interest, like women's
clothing or toys for toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers also have privacy policies that they don't have to
have, but prominently display in response to consumers' rightful
concerns that they'll distribute your name and credit card number
to every online con artist between here and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, online retailing was uncharted territory.
A few online retailers like Amazon.com or CDNow.com were selling
things, but unless you were a serious Web surfer, you had no idea
what they were and whether they were legitimate. Traditional
brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's or Tower Records were still
trying to figure out how to navigate the unfamiliar waters of
online retailing.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ads for online retailers during a National Football League
halftime show nearly outnumber ads for cars, beer and mutual funds,
and the companies advertising are stores like the Gap (www.gap.com)
and KB Toys (www.kbtoys.com), where consumers have been spending
money offline for years. They are not likely to run off with your
money or your credit card number if you decide to do business with
them online.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites just want your e-mail address, so they can try to
sell you more stuff more often. That's what they want when they ask
you to opt in. What you get is news of special offers that will
save you time and money. That's the real value of sharing
information with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to opt in, you will get a weekly or maybe a
monthly or even a less frequent e-mail from your favorite online
retailers advising you of what's new at their respective sites. The
types of offers can range from discounts to special offers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at CDNow, you'll find out when new releases are
going on sale, and you'll get coupons offering free shipping,
discounts or other special offers available only to the online
mailing list. Online clothing company Land's End (www.landsend
</P>
<P>
   .com) has a weekly overstocks newsletter of discounted
merchandise that you must visit the site and request. Major
airlines offer subscribers a weekly list of discounted Web fares.
Other sites, like the Bobbi Brown cosmetics site, will let you know
about special items that are only being sold online.
</P>
<P>
   During the holidays, when every dollar counts, e-mail bulletins
about shopping bargains and exclusives, shipping discounts or what
performances of the Nutcracker are still available Christmas week
can be handy.
</P>
<P>
   To drag out Martha Stewart's well-worn phrase: ``It's a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And remember, you can always chose to opt ouonic versions of
books lying in bed at night, after my wife is asleep, there quietly
in the darkness. ... I format the pages so the lines are equal to
my reading style, which helps me to read fast and comfortably. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to bend down the pages to mark a favorite
passage. You do that electronically, or copy it and file it or
share it with somebody in an e-mail, all right there in the quiet
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have academic meetings, they like to make me the
secretary. I take notes as we go, highlighting what is important,
and when the meeting is over I offer everybody a copy of the
minutes, which I download to the printer in the room. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``No, my wife does not wear a computer, but in me she has a good
executive assistant. ... When she runs across something, a passage
in a book or whatever, she asks me to `file it,' and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The family that computes together ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his wearable computer is like a member of the family,
with special needs, all of which Starner has le to say `remind me
about my meeting with Jonas Tuesday at 3:30 at the office ... and
let's include Fran and Jennifer and Mark,' and the machine will
know which Tuesday and the place and the identity of Fran and
Jennifer and Mark and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example, someone may place a call via the Internet,
only to have the machine say, ``Sorry, Thad is teaching right now,
but he has been waiting to talk to you. ... Please call back at
3:30, when he should have some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today Starner says he often boards a plane to keep an
appointment in another city with no record of specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can access a file at any time, either my
calendar or an e-mail message, that tells me exactly the time and
place and who will meet me or whatever,'' Starner said.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of steps between today's equipment and the point
where computers understand us and what we want in context, Starner
said, but that system will take shape, bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   He did not add that even though he foresees 20 years in the
development, these things occur at an accelerating pace.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it ever occurred to him to wear a computer, Starner
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in ninth grade when I asked my father for an answer to
a trigonometry question. He said that, even though he used trig
every day, he had forgotten much of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, I couldn't understand how my father could have
forgotten such useful training. I learned the value of staying in
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first idea that the interface might be interesting was when
watching a science fiction movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Starner is operating personally on the edge of science
fiction, and always in touch.

 &HT;    Microsoft continues innovative streak with new real-time game
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News ServiceFOR THE DESKTOP
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say what you will about Microsoft _ it continues to
revolutionize gaming with its quality peripherals and great games.
So what if its latest, Age of Empires II ($50 for the PC), is yet
another in a long line of real-time strategy games? The company
gets it right, improving upon a great product and introducing
compelling campaigns, including a brilliant William Wallace
training scenario and the rise of Joan of Arc. While Age of Empires
took you through the beginnings of civilization, Age of Empires II
propels you from the fall of Rome to the Middle Ages. The game's
got better intelligence, more tactical options and better stories.
One of the truly best empire-building games around.

   _ Madden football is like Thanksgiving leftovers. No matter what
you do, you know it's coming, and you know there's nothing you'll
be able to do about it. For the past few years, PC football games
have improved dramatically in graphics and game-play, led by folks
like EA Sports. This year's Madden 2000 ($40) is graphics- and
feature-rich, but unfortunately it just can't compete with the
intuitiveness and game-play of some of its console brethren.
Multiplayer and updated stats are standard fare for Madden games,
but 2000 has a few new features, such as an arcade mode that
emulates NFL Blitz. Harder hits and tired ``edgy'' commentary,
however, don't add up to Blitz's fun. And the game is glitchy,
causing strange crashes and errors on some 3dfx graphics cards and
often inexplicably starting the game with teams different than
those you selected. The graphics are ho-hum and the game-play
hasn't advanced much from last year. With games like Sega's amazing
NFL2K blazing trails on the console side, this may not be the best
year for Madden pound cake.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know, the first Nyko Scorpion Playstation controller
($30) I was sent had a screw missing in the handle. The apologies
were profuse and I was immediately sent another one (they assured
me it was an anomaly). Workmanship aside, this is an amazing
controller. If you're like me, you've been complaining about the
size of the Playstation controller since it came out. The Sony dual
shock controller added some heft, but it was still pretty small in
the hand. Nyko has worked to eradicate that with the Scorpion. The
controller is wider (looking like a cross between a stingray and
Klingon battle cruiser) and fits in the hand better. Also, the
controller puts those hard-to-reach R2, L2 buttons within reach,
which really helps on the sports games. The controller also comes
with turbo (speeds things up) and slow (exactly what it sounds
like) modes for the cheater in you. (www.nyko.com)

 &HT;    Barney gets in on bongo act
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's amazing that anything with Barney's mug on
it still exists. There was a time where the purple dinosaur
inspired rage and social backlash. Now, it's the opposite. Barney
is back in favor, in part because of cool toys such as Barney's
Song Magic Bongos ($30). The Magic Bongos play 11 songs on five
different instruments. All kids have to do is pick their song (i.e.
``Farmer in the Dell'' among others) and an instrument, ranging
from a steel drum to a hooting organ sound, and start bonging away.
Each hit yields a note and, following that principle, a bunch of
notes/hits play a song. This toy is great for those creative kids
just starting to attain their dexterity, and is also good for
celebrities who insist on dancing around their homes naked.

   Bugs Bunny has a problem. On the way to Albuquerque he finds a
time machine. That's not the bad part. The bad part is that he
tries to use it and gets lost in time. In Infogrames' Bugs Bunny:
Lost in Time ($30, for the Playstation), that wascaly wabbit must
travel through five different eras in order to get back to the
present. Along the way, he meets up with favorites such as Elmer
Fudd, Witch Hazel, Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian. If nothing
else, this game teaches the kiddies that you shouldn't play with
time machines.

   SAY 'UNCLE'
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Albert is a little touched in the head (we'll just
euphemistically call him ``eccentric''), but boy is it fun to poke
around in his stuff! In Uncle Albert's Magical Album ($30, PC and
Mac), you can look through Albert's scrapbook and piece together an
assortment of puzzles by flipping through pages and putting items
in the right places; if you find a key you can unlock the
rocketship game and go on a space journey. Find the picture of the
champ and you can play in the stadium. The game, a best-seller in
France, is handily adapted to the U.S. and runs on Windows PCs and
Macs. It features many small films, eight individual games and a
host of animal friends to play with. (www.vtechsoft.com/album.html)

   BRAINS, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember those family vacations when mom and dad would
pack up the kids and a Styrofoam cooler full of bologna sandwiches
and store-brand cola, heading off at 5 a.m. for parts unknown? Do
you fondly recall pelting your parents with countless questions en
route to your destination?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Brain Quest series ($30, PC and Mac) lets your own
kids take that trip, albeit virtually, as tagalongs with the
Perdido family in its brain-powered vacation van. Better the
Perdido's than you, eh? ``Alas,'' you think, ``my kids are getting
their question-and-answer fix somewhere else. Our trips to the
grocery store will be peaceful and question-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And the computerized queries go well beyond the classic, ``Are
we there yet?'' In fact, the engaging program quizzes kids with
thousands of puzzlers in math, science, language arts and social
studies, each grade-tailored correct answer moving the van forward
toward their reward: a postcard of the Perdidos at their vacation
destination.
</P>
<P>
   With an Internet connection, Brain Quest variations include
multiplayer game modes and help with answers via the World Book
online encyclopedia. For a fee, extra game packs with more
questions can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, beware: Each Brain Quest title includes a booklet of
bound cards with trivia questions on all 50 states, meaning the
Q-and-A can continue far away from the keyboard. Better brush up on
your U.S. trivia _ looks like those shopping trips won't be so
peaceful after all.

 &HT;    Online help for holiday overeaters
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday is when we start packing it on. Thanksgiving
usually heralds the beginning of the heavy eating season. From
there, it's one long month of holiday parties, Christmas-colored
M&AMP;M's and mall fast-food _ a big, sugar-coated slide toward a New
Year's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.phys.com, offers an attempt at moderation. The
site contains information about nutrition, weight loss and
pregnancy. But this fall, it has started a holiday survival guide
designed to get you to perhaps drop that second chalupa.
</P>
<P>
   The average person gains at least five pounds during the
holidays, according to phys.com's dietician. The survival guide's
goal is to keep you from overeating and to squeeze in some
occasional exercise along with that last cookie.
</P>
<P>
   The site is geared toward women between 20 and 40, but features
such as calorie counters and calorie-burners could be worthwhile
for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION SITE RESPONDS TO POKEMON SCARCITY
</P>
<P>
   They're as freaky looking as Teletubbies, and the movie
apparently is awful, but kids love Pokemon, the furry Japanese
pocket monsters, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a parent to do this holiday season? Stand in line at
the toy store like you did for Cabbage Patch Kids, Tickle Me Elmo
dolls and Furbys?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, those lines led to a few fistfights and some nice
economics lessons. Toy demand was greater than toy supply, so
instant auctions were started, with people offering way more than
face value for a tangible piece of pop culture history.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, people are getting a head start on what
is expected to be a sought-after, and fought-after, item this year.
</P>
<P>
   An auction Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .pokemonnation.com, has more than 1,500 Pokemon items for sale.
Signing up for the site costs nothing. Membership lets you buy,
sell or trade Pokemon merchandise. Pokemon e-mail accounts are
available, as are trading boards and chat rooms. The site also
includes a Pokemon glossary to help tell the difference between the
150 characters.
</P>
<P>
   PokemonNation.com is a subsidiary of CollectingNation.com, a
Connecticut-based auction site.
</P>
<P>
   WEB-A-THON ASSISTS AILING GARY COLEMAN
</P>
<P>
   Gary Coleman, the former actor who once sought your viewing
attention on TV's ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' now wants your money.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old, once worth $18 million, filed for bankruptcy in
August. Now he's selling stuff from a Web site, webathon.ugo.com/,
to help pay his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the public relations firm representing UGO
Networks, the Web site sponsoring the auction, told the Reuters
news service that the site had Coleman's approval and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot, 8-inch Coleman suffers from end-stage renal disease
and requires kidney dialysis three times a week. In an August
interview, Coleman said the treatments helped drain his bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the star of the former NBC sitcom will be able to donate
money and bid for Coleman's personal items, including an
autographed spatula, a natty, pin-striped suit and an ice scraper.
Donors are eligible to receive such items as Gary Coleman votive
candles, Gary Coleman Zippo lighters and Gary Coleman commemorative
plates, featuring a picture of Coleman and Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The site features Gary Grooves, a three-dimensional image of
Gary dancing to house music. Visitors to the site can register for
a $1,000 shopping spree with Coleman tagging along to help.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a pop-up timeline that lets site visitors
follow key events in Coleman's life, complete with images and text.
Key moments include:
</P>
<P>
   _ May 1978. The series pilot, ``45 Minutes from Harlem,'' is
shot. The show is picked up, renamed ``Diff'rent Strokes'' and
starts airing on NBC that November.
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1984. Coleman has his second kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 15, 1999. The Gary Coleman Celebrity Web-a-thon kicks
off.

 &HT;    Adobe kit the ultimate for Web page design
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you intend to go into Web site production in a big
way, consider a new Adobe package called Web Collection, built
around the firm's redoubtable Photoshop image-control program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Photoshop 5, the collection includes Illustrator
8, for creating your own drawings and images, ImageStyler for
creating even fancier objects and GoLive, Adobe's Web page editor.
</P>
<P>
   For most folks, this package constitutes major overkill. It is
intended for professionals, and one way or another it will do
everything imaginable in terms of creating a Web page or a major
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who haven't been into computers for long, or
haven't been paying attention, Adobe Systems sprang to life within
the Macintosh world with its venerable page layout program
PageMaker and is still centered there. All these programs have been
ported to the PC system for years now, but for PC users the
dichotomy will present a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Adobe programs don't use a second mouse button,
let alone a third, is not so bothersome as the manuals, which are
exceedingly complete but intended to serve both masters. Thus, many
of the instructions are issued twice _ here's how you do it on the
PC, and here's how you do it on the Mac. This inevitably becomes
confusing and also accounts to a degree for the bulky manuals. The
problem seems somewhat more obvious in GoLive, perhaps because this
is its first appearance in the Windows world.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop, which is by far and away the most popular of
professional photograph manipulation programs, and Illustrator have
been around for a long time, as their version numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Since GoLive is new to to the PC platform and is, after all, the
program that will be used to get all the fancy pictures up and
running on the Internet, I concentrated on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a former Mac-only program called GoLive CyberStudio,
acquired by Adobe to give it an entry in the high-end Web design
field.
</P>
<P>
   The layout of a page in GoLive is much more like working in a
standard layout program than any site editor I've used. The page
construction screen uses a grid for precise layout and as an
alternative offers to set up columns and rows as the user wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Images and text can be dragged and dropped from various
palettes. It offers a dozen working JavaScript functions and a
movie editor (for Quicktime flicks) for enhancing a page with
action.
</P>
<P>
   Like its companion pieces, GoLive is an enormous and complex
program. Inevitably, complexity steepens the learning curve, and
GoLive's is steep indeed. The manual runs over 400 pages, and it
will be fairly dog-eared before a serious user is fully comfortable
with the program. In the course of it, the user can expect to
become more familiar with HTML code operations, which underly all
Web pages, than with most lower-end programs. That, of course, is
to be expected also.
</P>
<P>
   GoLive is a direct challenge to Microsoft's FrontPage, and while
it may very well do more _ I haven't looked at FrontPage's last
couple of iterations _ it is not as intuitive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, GoLive costs about $300. The powerhouse, four-program
Web Collection runs over $1,000.

 &HT;    In diagnosing computer woes, start with last change made
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If your television broke down as often as most
computers, you'd have a lot more quality time to spend with your
family.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail from across the country, half of which
asks for advice on how to fix something that has gone wrong with a
computer. I'm not a computer genius, but even if I were, I'd have a
hard time fixing these problems remotely. I'm in the same position
as an auto mechanic who gets a phone call demanding to know what's
wrong when the family car makes a chuga-woo-chercuck noise as it
goes up steep hills.
</P>
<P>
   There are some methods you can use at home that will help you
find _ and maybe even fix _ some computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know about computers is that _ unlike with
your car _ the most likely suspect is not a hardware failure.
Obviously it happens, but it's not the best assumption to start
with. Instead, start by being a detective. Think back to the last
change you made to your computer before it began to malfunction.
Anything from a new computer program, to an updated browser, to a
new modem or scanner, or even changes to an existing program can be
(and often is) the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine at work recently profited by that type of
thinking. His printer stopped working. He fussed and fooled and
fulminated with settings and controls until he walked away and
started thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered that he had just installed a new word
processor. There is no logical reason that should cause a printer
to stop working, but it was his best clue. So he removed the word
processor (using the Windows uninstall program you'll find under
the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel).
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't know why the word processor (WordPerfect)
caused the problem, but he doesn't care. Unless you are a computer
technician, you probably shouldn't care either. He just knows his
computer works OK now, and he will call Corel, the publisher of
WordPerfect, to get advice on how to reinstall the word processor
correctly. He has important information in hand. He knows what is
wrong. Without that information, it's impossible to fix a lamp, a
car or a computer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be times _ plenty of them _ when you can't find a
logical suspect for the computer's behavior. You'll swear nothing
has changed, and you'll want to blame something trendy like a
virus. Viruses are real but _ at least in my experience _ they
aren't the most likely cause of an unknown problem. But if you want
to reduce the odds that a virus is the culprit, get a good
anti-virus program and use it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've ruled out a recent change in your computer and a
virus, what do you do next?
</P>
<P>
   The smart next step is to go to the Device Manager you'll find
under the System icon to see if Windows can help. In many cases, it
will flag a conflict between two devices (when two gizmos try to
share the same computer address they make cruddy roommates). If you
find an exclamation mark like this ! beside a device, that's an
excellent clue. Windows has a help feature that will guide you
through fixing the problem it finds (although I'll have to admit
that the prose is pretty thick if you aren't a techie).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if all else fails, consider reinstalling Windows.
Sometimes things get so messed up that only a reinstall will fix
them (unless you have the time and the skill to pinpoint the
problem).
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest editing a file that Windows calls the
Registry, but I shy away from that. But since I am not always
right, my advice is to read a good book on Windows (something other
than the manual that comes with it) and make up your own mind when
it comes to editing the Registry file (which keeps track of almost
every setting in your computer).
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, do as a good physician would. Don't try
something that can make something worse. If you're stuck and in
over your head, do one thing. Call an expert and get some help.

 &HT;    Dell house makes family Net work
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Christmas is closing in, and ``Dellbert,'' an
imaginary teen-age inhabitant of Dell Computer Inc.'s ``Holiday
House,'' suspects that his parents forgot his Christmas wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Better to put it on paper, he decides, using a festive font and
full color, with photos downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He sends it from his bedroom personal computer to his parents'
printer and then e-mails it to his mother _ who can read it in the
kitchen on her notebook PC. It can't escape his mother's attention,
Dellbert figures, because she is always surfing the Web wirelessly
for new recipes.
</P>
<P>
   These were a few of the visions evoked last week during a tour
of Dell Computer Corp.'s Holiday House, set up in a quiet red-brick
townhome at the Las Vegas Country Club, a mile or so from the din
of Comdex. The giant PC-industry trade show attracted more than
150,000 visitors and 2,100 companies, but Dell, following its
custom, did not have a big booth at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, the No. 1 personal computer maker in the United States,
rented the townhome to demonstrate how available technology from a
variety of hardware and software providers can establish
high-speed, local-area networks in any house. Dell has assembled
several PC packages with these features and more in time for the
holidays, ranging in price from $2,899 to $1,849. All include
56-kilobit Internet access from Dell for one year. Installation
costs and monthly fees for high speed Internet access via DSL or
cable systems are not included in those prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, whose vision includes fully functioning PCs throughout the
house, believes some type of desktop computer will become the nerve
center of Internet connectivity for households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and communication are coming together,'' said Ron
Van Dell, director of branding for Dell's Dimension, adding that
communication, or networking, means linking multiple PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are going to be able to do a lot more than they've
done in the past,'' he said, sitting in the living room of the
Holiday House with a lighted Christmas tree behind him. ``But that
freedom of choice brings a surprising degree of complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell believes it has solved that problem.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get into that, let's tour the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Dell's Inspiron notebook for consumers gets
Internet access through a wireless link to a Dimension, Dell's
consumer desktop PC, in the family room or living room. The
wireless network is based on a standard format known as 802.11 that
is effective up to 150 feet and can accommodate several PCs and
offer speeds of up to 11 megabits per second. The notebook with the
wireless network connection is expected next month. All other
features are available now.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension is connected by a VCR-type cable to a large-screen
TV that allows the TV to show a DVD movie running on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the notebook in the kitchen also could pick up the
movie. But encryption rules designed to prevent piracy forbid
transmission of digital content over the network, said Marc
Padovani, a Dell product-marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop whoever's in the kitchen from tapping into
holiday music from dozens of CDs whose contents are stored on the
Dimension's 13.6-gigabyte hard drive using MP3, a technology that
takes up less space. Using an easy-to-follow screen and software
from MusicMatch Jukebox, music stored on the hard drive is
accessible from any PC in the LAN, or local-area network. Music
also can be downloaded via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After storing music on one hard drive and backing it up on
another, these CDs could be stored in a closet, or even sold at a
used-CD store. Dell, however, isn't recommending that.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Dell house, every bedroom has a Dimension and big-screen
monitor. These upstairs PCs are linked to each other and the
downstairs Dimension in a high-speed network using existing
telephone wiring. That is a feature of pre-installed hardware from
3Com Corp. and software from Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   All desktop PCs in the house can share music and video files
stored anywhere, but parents can restrict access to files with
passwords.
</P>
<P>
   In their bedrooms, Dellbert and his sister, Dellila, can play
computer games with each other or send the full-color Christmas
lists to their parent's printer. They also can see each other
through small cameras on the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   With user-friendly software from Homestead.com, and Internet
access through Dell.com, Dell encourages consumers to build their
own Web pages. Home-movie clips or stills from digital cameras can
be added to the pages. For family and friends who prefer a hard
copy, a Sony Corp. recordable CD-ROM drive lets you put all that on
your customized CD.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds fun, but pretty darned complicated for the average
family, right? And we haven't even mentioned that existing
Dimensions in the house have to be upgraded to connect to the
network.
</P>
<P>
   The first test groups that Dell assembled when it was creating a
special CD to guide consumers through installation and set-up had a
perfect record _ of failure, said Van Dell, the branding director.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell believes it has made the process easy enough for a
family that doesn't know a LAN from a lunar lander to master
without anxiety. It now expects at least an 80 percent success
rate. ``It's not, `Where is our specialist in the neighborhood who
can help us?''' Van Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is perhaps one drawback that the computer maker
hasn't anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   With all the diversions available in Dell's wired house, parents
with children _ say, 3 and older _ might wonder how they'll get
everybody disconnected so the family can sit down together and
talk.

 &HT;    FileMaker Pro database program updated for network, Web use
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're an entrepreneur who needs to track clients
or a just a collector desperate for a way to catalog your holdings,
you might take a look at the latest version of FileMaker Pro.
</P>
<P>
   This venerable database program, controlled by Apple, lets you
create everything from client and product lists to CD catalogs,
address books, calendars and invoices _ whatever you need to track.
</P>
<P>
   With version 5.0, you can also share your address book with
others on a network or post a list of products or clients on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Database programs let you store and analyze any kind of
information. With these programs you can total up, say, sales in
the Midwest or every book in your collection written by Kurt
Vonnegut.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker Pro is considered an entry-level database for small
businesses, home users and work groups within a bigger company.
It's designed to be easy-to-use and understand without any
background in programming.
</P>
<P>
   No program meets this standard, but FileMaker Pro is pretty easy
to use and learn compared with most database programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with lots of templates that you can adopt as your
own. Better yet, the Internet and local bulletin boards are full of
templates users have built into FileMaker Pro and distributed for
others to use.
</P>
<P>
   While this program has been around for years, the latest version
includes several new features. For one, FileMaker Pro has been
redesigned to look and act more like the programs in Microsoft's
Office suite of software. You'll find menu toolbars and pop-up
context menus that resemble those in Office.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this redesign is to make FileMaker Pro familiar
and useful to a larger audience. Does it work? Only in part,
according to most reviewers. They found the mix of FileMaker Pro
styles and those of Microsoft confusing in spots.
</P>
<P>
   The program also goes too far at times in simplicity, crossing
over into ``dumbed-down.'' In the name of simplicity, for example,
FileMaker Pro includes only six fonts. It's a laborious procedure
to load in more.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any built-in programming language for power users.
That limits FileMaker Pro's appeal for bigger tasks such as running
a company's human resources department, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the program is receiving high marks for many of its
easy-to-use features. It's easy, for example, to create reports and
different ways to analyze and view information. The program walks
users through these things step-by-step through ``assistants,'' a
feature much like Microsoft's Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Another big plus is that, like Microsoft products, FileMaker Pro
works on both the Mac and PC platforms. That means databases
created in one platform will work in the other.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker Pro retails for about $240, with the upgrade selling
for about $100 less.

 &HT;    When hard work doesn't pay offBy Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Todd Rogers' story is one you don't hear very
often in a town like Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he quit his job and became a high-tech entrepreneur.
But he didn't become a member of one of Central Texas' growing
league of overnight high-tech millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' company, which developed software for veterinary
clinics, failed. Today, nearly a year later, he's still paying off
debts. He drives a Honda Accord, not a Porsche. He doesn't live in
a mansion. And he's back working for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was to write a really nice piece of software that
people would use,'' says Rogers, 29. ``But there were a lot of
things I didn't take into account. Nothing went as planned. We had
a lot of bad luck. And we made a lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the visible success of Austin's high-tech industry, the
truth is that far more tech upstarts fail than succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody tracks how many high-tech companies go under annually,
but venture capitalists use a formula for assessing the odds. It's
called the four-three-three, and it assumes that of every 10
companies that raise money, four will fail quickly, three will fail
slowly, three will survive, and hopefully one of those three
survivors will be a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear so much about the huge successes that we forget that
there are many more startups that sink,'' says Kirk Walden,
national director of venture capital research for the
PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. ``Every entrepreneur has a
chance to fail or succeed, and failure is a heck of a lot more
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Rogers' company sank in late 1998 after a two-year
struggle. Eighty-hour weeks produced solid software and a handful
of loyal clients. But that wasn't enough to make up for a small
market, a chronic shortage of cash and poor marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers poured $140,000 in savings into the company before it
closed. What he has to show for it today is stacked in the garage
of his Southwest Austin home: Boxes and boxes of unused CD-ROMs and
worthless stock options. ``You never hear about the other side of
startups,'' says Rogers, who, with his boyish smile and
close-cropped hair, could be played by actor Chris O'Donnell if
they made a movie about his defeat. ``It's kind of the untold part
of the high-tech story that a lot of us have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, like last week when a surprise $200 tax bill arrived
from the comptroller's office, Rogers regrets ever having dared to
launch his company, Tower Software Inc. But other days he's more
philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent hours and hours thinking about it,'' say Rogers,
who is now a consultant at a software services company. ``I've
beaten myself up over it. But now I'm realizing that I probably
learned more from failing than if it had succeeded. I've grown up a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Destiny of a company
</P>
<P>
   If Rogers' decision to start his own company can be traced to
one thing, it's boredom.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 1995 with a
degree in computer engineering, he joined a software contractor
doing data modeling and analysis for General Motors Corp.'s Saturn
division in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a job, just a job,'' he says. ``You never felt like you
were having an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He had toyed with starting his own company, but never had an
idea that felt right. Then he got a call from his brother, a
veterinarian in Hawaii. All the software for managing vet clinics
was lousy and expensive, he complained. Why don't you come up with
something better?
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Rogers began researching the market. It seemed ideal
_ 35,000 to 40,000 veterinary clinics in the United States, and a
handful of small companies selling behind-the-times software
(mostly based on the ancient DOS platform).
</P>
<P>
   ``The software was four to five years behind, techwise,'' Rogers
says. ``I mean, the stuff was crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that veterinarians wanted something snazzier was
his first mistake. ``The thing I didn't anticipate was the vets
being completely unreceptive to new technology. Looking back, I
realize that just because I could write software using Delphi (a
programming language) didn't mean anyone would buy it. At the time,
though, it seemed like I had stumbled across a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   During his year as a programmer, Rogers had stashed away $70,000
for graduate school. A zooming stock market sent his savings
soaring to $140,000. He had paid off his car, and could live for
free in a mobile home on some property his parents owned in Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Tower Software was born.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers went to work pounding out code from the mobile home,
later from a rented house with a roommate and finally from free
office space at the Texas Dental Association he got in exchange for
doing computer consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go out and socialize, I didn't do anything but sit in
front of the computer and code for six months,'' says Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   He recruited an old friend, Chris Jackson, to move from Houston
to be his partner, and the two proudly visited their first vet
clinic to test the software, which manages vet medical records.
They chose the Houston clinic where Rogers' family had taken its
ducks, rabbits, cats and dogs for years. They left humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just tore the thing to shreds,'' Rogers says. ``I was
just so way off in terms of usability. It was useless.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time around, the two spent nights at an emergency
animal clinic watching how workers entered data and used their
software. Days were spent doing a massive software rewrite. Six
months later, they were ready to face the vets again. This time
they worked closely with three clinics _ in Austin, Schertz and
Houston _ to make sure the software did what it should.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Dr. Corky Trlica of Travis Country Veterinary
Hospital, took a special interest in Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked their entrepreneurial spirit,'' he says. ``I don't
have computer experience, and they helped me learn it. In exchange,
I was hoping I could help them build the software from a vet
standpoint. Usually, it's the computer monkeys that design the
systems, and then us knothead vets have to try to learn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trlica says he was impressed by the software, but skeptical of
Tower's viability. ``The system was pretty bulletproof, it was the
best I had seen. But I kept asking them if you sell 10 of these a
month can you make a living? I didn't see how they could keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was wondering the same thing. He hadn't taken a salary in
24 months, the company had burned through $70,000 and it was
gearing up to spend thousands more on direct mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Rogers and Jackson estimated they could live on
selling four or five copies a month (at $2,000 to $3,000 per
clinic). But even after sending out 300 demos and getting positive
response from ads in vet trade magazines, sales were slow.
</P>
<P>
   The thing Rogers didn't realize, Trlica says, is that vets don't
like change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd misjudged the marketplace, and how conservative this
business is,'' Trlica says. ``Vets as a rule don't go for the
latest and greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tower ``would sell a couple copies, then a couple
more, but we weren't selling enough to cover our expenses,'' Rogers
says. ``It was getting really old not having a paycheck. We were
sinking our hearts into it and getting nothing back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers knew he desperately needed to invest heavily in direct
marketing and hire a full-time salesperson to work the phones all
day _ but he couldn't afford either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with some venture capitalists, but our market was too
small to interest them,'' he says. ``Finally, we sat down and said
`We have no money. Let's find a competitor who has really crappy
software and sell them ours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another six months was spent negotiating a promising deal with a
software company, but in the end they couldn't agree on a price. A
phone conversation with a friend in Houston is what finally
convinced Rogers it was time to rethink his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked how my relationship with my wife was and I realized
our marriage was kind of decaying,'' he says. ``That was when I
realized I could find another job, but I could never find another
Erin. It became really clear that this wasn't going to cut it. It
was time to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Tower Software closed for good.
</P>
<P>
   THE AFTERMATH
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, pulling the plug felt like a huge relief to
Rogers. But then came the pain: Sending out resumes to get another
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was finally admitting that Tower was over,'' says Rogers.
``I kept thinking about the people who had spent their money on our
software, and how they believed in us, and we were letting them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower found a software consulting company that agreed to take
over its 12 customers. Recently, he put his software up for sale on
online auction site eBay Inc. He says he got a bite, which he hopes
may still pan out.
</P>
<P>
   Failure didn't hurt when it came to job hunting. Jackson got a
job designing computer networks for Temple-Inland Corp., and Rogers
was hired quickly by Catapult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high-tech, failure isn't a stigma,'' says Walden of
PriceWaterhouseCoopers. ``Tech companies would rather see someone
who struggled to get a business off the ground than someone who sat
in a cubicle for 20 years. It's all about `What did you learn?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' list of lessons is long.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I realized is that hard work in software is about half of
what you need to make something successful. The other part is good
management and good marketing,'' he says. ``I should have spent
more time studying the industry, and I needed to hire people rather
than do it all myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 months since Tower went out of business, Rogers has
supplemented his Catapult income by working nights as a software
contractor to pay off debts. This year he settled $10,000 in
Tower-related debt, and has another $3,500 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Filing for bankruptcy crossed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally we could have blown it all off,'' he says. ``But I
teach a Bible study to high school kids, and I can't go in there
and tell them all this stuff about honesty and not be living it.''
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, and the disappointment fades, Rogers is
beginning to understand that he met more goals than he initially
realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be a millionaire,'' says Rogers. ``What I
dreamed about was seeing someone use something that came out of my
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget walking into a vet's office and seeing a
receptionist using our system. She wasn't complaining or anything.
She was just using it to get stuff done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the coolest moment, and it's what I want to remember
about Tower Software.''

 &HT;    Portable e-mail units handy
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Not everybody who wants to send and receive
e-mail wants or needs a personal computer. It's possible to have
e-mail with a device that connects to phone lines and a service
that provides e-mail access only.
</P>
<P>
   VTech Industries of Wheeling, Ill., sells several e-mail
products that it says can be used anywhere by simply plugging them
into a telephone jack. Two of the products, e-Mail PostBox and
e-Mail Express, sell for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail Express is designed to be very portable. It measures
6.3-by-3.5 inches and weighs about 7 ounces. It's compact size
limits the size of the keyboard and the LCD viewing screen,
however, so it may be somewhat uncomfortable for some people to
use.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail Express has an address book and calendar and can save
up to 500 messages. It has a ``Smart Dialer'' feature that ensures
you get a local phone rate no matter where you're calling from.
</P>
<P>
   It also has filters to block e-mail you don't want. The device
can be set to accept e-mails only from a list of known senders, so
you won't be flooded with advertisements, and parents can protect
children from receiving adult material.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail PostBox is a desktop model with a few more features
than e-Mail Express. It has a full-size keyboard, but it's still
compact at about 2.2 pounds and 12.4 by 8.2 inches. It also has a
larger LCD screen _ eight lines of 40 characters _ than the e-Mail
Express, which has five lines of 40 characters.
</P>
<P>
   The e-Mail PostBox supports up to five individual e-mail
accounts, each with its own calendar, address book and memo pad.
</P>
<P>
   VTech sells e-Mail Express for $79.99 and e-Mail PostBox for
$99.99 only by phone or online. To order call (888) 468-8324
(GO-VTECH) or log on at www.vtechworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   VTech also supplies the e-mail service for its devices. The
service costs $24.99 a quarter or $89.99 a year. To sign up you
must have a credit card, and service charges will be deducted from
your credit card account until you cancel the service.

   ATLANTA _ Looking for a dramatic career change, perhaps from
prosecutor to video game developer? Then check out the November
issue of Fast Company magazine. An article profiles people who have
made remarkable career changes. There's a jazz musician who became
a successful business consultant and a prosecutor who did become a
video game producer.

<P>
   The issue, dated for December, features articles about how to
avoid Internet scams and how to search the Web for great bargains.

   The makers of ``SimCity'' and ``Theme Park'' have teamed up for
a new computer CD called ``SimTheme Park.'' It's an interactive
simulation that lets you create rides and then group them into an
amusement park. Published by Electronic Arts, ``SimTheme Park''
retails for about $40. It's available only for PCs with Windows 95
or higher.

   Indiana Jones lives on in the latest computer game about the
fictional hero from LucasArts. In this sequel, ``Indiana Jones and
the Infernal Machine,'' our hero battles Soviet agents in 1947. The
game is set in the Middle East and explores the Tower of Babel.
Like all the titles in this series, ``Infernal Machine'' is a 3-D
role-playing game. ``Infernal Machine'' is available only for PCs
running Windows 95 or higher.

   One of the best ways to learn something is through practice,
playing and experimenting with what you have learned. The Internet
is a wonderful playground for students of all ages. Take math, for
example. ``Absurd Math'' is a collection of puzzles and games that
test pre-algebra math skills. There are hidden clues and mysteries
to be solved through cracking math problems. You'll find this site

 &HT;    Grabbing stocks at IPO price tough, risky
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We've all heard about high-tech employees making
huge amounts of money when their companies start selling stock to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   So how do the rest of us get in on the action?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on how daring you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard truth is that initial public offerings just aren't
set up for the individual investor,'' says Pat Dorsey, a stock
analyst with investment research company Morningstar Inc. ``But if
you want stock in a newly public company, and you don't mind paying
a premium and taking your chances, you can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, eight Austin-area high-tech companies have
gone public, more than in any other year. Hundreds of employees
have become overnight millionaires _ at least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   In an initial public offering, a company raises money by selling
stock to investors outside the company for the first time. Some of
the stock typically is sold to employees, company insiders and
others. The rest of the shares are sold to investment banks, which
in turn resell them to brokers and institutional investors, such as
mutual fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   The only time most average investors can buy the stock is after
it starts trading on the open market. And in the case of the hot
tech companies, the stock generally trades at a price well above
the IPO price.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO price depends on how well a company is received by
institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies.
If the institutional investors like a company, its offering price
will be high, say $18-$20 in the case of a tech company. If the
response is lukewarm, it will most likely be priced lower, perhaps
at $8-$10 a share. Since in recent offerings tech stocks have
tripled or quadrupled on their opening day, for those lucky enough
to get in on the IPO shares, ``it's basically guaranteed money,''
says Kent Fuka, a venture capitalist with CenterPoint Ventures in
Austin. ``Everyone wants those kind of odds, which is why getting
the stock is so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossroads Systems Inc., an Austin tech company that went public
Oct. 20, is a case in point. The company priced its stock at $18,
and the stock closed the first day at $78.71 7/8. That means those
who had IPO stock paid $18 for shares that gained 337 percent when
they went public.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Crossroads shares closed at $76.50.
</P>
<P>
   If you want in on an IPO badly enough, there are ways to do it.
It starts with who you know.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage houses often get some shares for customers _ but you
have to be a very good customer, meaning you have an account worth
several hundred thousand dollars and trade frequently.
</P>
<P>
   For most folks, the best bet _ and it's still a long shot _ is
to be buddies with someone who works at the company that's going
public. Many companies allow employees to give a set number of
shares to friends and family. But even executives, employees and
their lucky friends can't cash in right away; securities
regulations require them to hold on to their stock for a certain
amount of time _ usually six months _ before they can sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Vignette Corp., for instance, gave each employee 200
shares of so-called friends and family stock when it went public in
February. The stock was on top of whatever shares employees could
buy through stock options. Employees could keep the stock, or give
it away.
</P>
<P>
   Kala Ranganathan, the company's public relations manager, split
the shares between her parents and in-laws, who were able to buy
the stock at the offering price of $19. Ranganathan, who later left
to join another tech company, recently sold the shares for her
relatives at $153 a share, giving each side $13,400 before taxes.
She has held on to her own Vignette stock. ``The stock was trading
at a high, and it seemed like the perfect holiday gift, so I sold
it for them,'' she says. ``It's not a really large amount of stock,
but it was a way to show my appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs that the Internet could help democratize
the IPO process. Online brokers such as Wit Capital and E-Trade are
increasingly touting their ability to get IPO shares for customers
through their relationships with investment banks. These companies
typically get just a handful of the total number of shares being
offered, and make them available over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hype about getting Internet IPO shares, but
very few people actually pull it off,'' Dorsey of Morningstar says.
``The number of shares available is still too small to give many
folks a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet auctions are also gaining popularity. W.R. Hambrecht &AMP;
Co. has begun what it calls an OpenIPO, which allows institutions
and individuals to bid on shares in an IPO on its Web site
(www.openipo.com).
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the companies have gone public using OpenIPO _
California vintner Ravenswood Winery and online magazine Salon.com
_ have been big successes. But IPO watchers say it's only a matter
of time until the idea catches on.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get in on an IPO and you're hungry enough for a
company's stock to buy it shortly after it begins trading, be
prepared for a rough ride.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of hot companies almost always jump from their offering
price. But there's no telling how long they'll stay up. If you buy
when they're up, you have to be ready for them to come back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a strong stomach,'' says Ray Hilton, a retired pet
store owner and stock investor. ``You also need to be lucky. It's a
big risk, and like any risk, there's a lot of luck involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the early trading is fast and furious. Experts recommend
that you put a cap on how much you're willing to spend per share,
and if it can't be had at that price, count yourself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should really decide what price you think is the right
price before the trading starts,'' says Mike Dunn, an attorney with
Brobeck Phleger &AMP; Harrison in Austin. ``Otherwise, you can get
caught up in the frenzy and end up buying at a price that quickly
takes a dive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's most recent gamble on Vignette has paid off, even
though he didn't get in on the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get IPO stock, but I couldn't, so I told my
(investment company) I wanted to buy it as soon as possible,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   After Vignette stock began trading, Hilton got 100 shares at $36
a share. Not as good as the $19 offering price, but better than its
first day closing price of $42.68 3/4. And far better than its
Friday closing price of $172.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I didn't give up when I couldn't get IPO shares,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work that way for Wade L. Smith Jr., an Austin
retiree. He bought $21,000 worth of online pharmacy PlanetRx.com
Inc. stock at $34 a share shortly after it started trading on Oct.
7. But the stock closed at $26 the first day, and it has been
downhill since then. On Friday, it closed at $21.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I've made more than $300,000 on Wal-Mart stock,
so this isn't going to hurt me,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying stock the first day is an extremely risky venture,''
says Dorsey of Morningstar. ``There's a lot of hype right at the
beginning, and when that dies down, the stock often dies down as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 459 IPOs that took place nationwide through Nov. 10, 316
are still trading above the offering price, while 140 are trading
below offering price and three are unchanged, according to the IPO
Reporter, which tracks the market. The average return over the
offering price was 103 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``IPO stocks tend to soar in the beginning, but the track record
is pretty poor in general over the long haul,'' Dorsey says. ``A
lot of energy that people spend focusing on IPO watching would be
better spent researching high-quality companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as exciting, but in the long run it can be a lot more
profitable.''

 &HT;    You could look it up: Reference tools sharp
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World Wide Web was pretty much a toyland in the
beginning. It was an amazing place to visit in its earliest days.
And almost everything you found there was fascinating and also
without any practical value.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's a very practical world for the most part. It's a
place where you can shop, check the weather, get a quick look at
the traffic you can expect on the way to work and find information
on everything from beekeeping to epoxies.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the handiest uses for the Web, whether you're at work
or doing homework for school, is the way that _ increasingly _ it
can substitute for a whole shelf of reference books. Since many
reference books get dated fast, the Web has real advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some of the places on the Web that _ when
used together _ form a handy collection of reference works.
</P>
<P>
   About the most mundane, and useful, reference book around is the
dictionary. Whether you need help in pronunciation, spelling or
just nailing down the definition of a word, a dictionary is the
anchor for most reference desks. Several sites on the Web offer
dictionaries, but one stands out: Dictionary.com at www
</P>
<P>
   .dictionary.com.
</P>
<P>
   The definitions come from Webster's Revised Unabridged
Dictionary. But there's a lot more on this page than just the
dictionary. You'll find links to Roget's Thesaurus (www.thesaurus
</P>
<P>
   .com if you want to go there directly); to dictionaries in
almost any language you can name; hints on grammar and style for
writers; and even a crossword section where you can put some of
those new words to quick use.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, of course, when a dictionary isn't enough. If
you want to know more about Will Rogers, for instance, you won't
get any help in the dictionary. But there is a great free online
encyclopedia. In fact, it's the online version of one of the best
electronic versions ... Microsoft's Encarta. You'll find it at
encarta.msn.com/. And if you key in the name Will Rogers, you'll
get a brief biography, a photograph and a selection of links that
will take you out into the Web to find out even more.
</P>
<P>
   Reference works aren't limited to dictionaries and
encyclopedias, of course. As the world has grown smaller _ thanks
in part to the Web _ the need has increased to understand people in
other parts of the world. In Europe, for instance, temperatures are
often expressed in Celsius degrees, rather than Fahrenheit, as is
used in most U.S. weather forecasts. To find an instant converter,
just type in the temperature and click the mouse to convert at www
</P>
<P>
   .isotech.co.uk/convert.html.
</P>
<P>
   And if you get an urgent e-mail from a customer who wants one of
those superdeluxe widgets that your company builds and is prepared
to budget up to $8,922 Singapore dollars, you'll know that amounts
to $5,344.46 (on the day this calculation was performed) in U.S.
currency. Most currencies that you've heard of _ and a few that you
haven't _ can be found here at www.asia1.com.sg
</P>
<P>
   /cgi-bin/bt/fxconv.pl.
</P>
<P>
   Translation can be a problem with the language itself, of
course. What if you get an e-mail from an Italian customer who
tells you ``Desidero comprare piu widgets''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's good news. That customer wants to buy more widgets.
You can do the translation yourself at babelfish.altavista
</P>
<P>
   .com/. You'll find help for German, French, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Christmas is closing in, and ``Dellbert,'' an
imaginary teen-age inhabitant of Dell Computer Inc.'s ``Holiday
House,'' suspects that his parents forgot his Christmas wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Better to put it on paper, he decides, using a festive font and
full color, with photos downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He sends it from his bedroom personal computer to his parents'
printer and then e-mails it to his mother _ who can read it in the
kitchen on her notebook PC. It can't escape his mother's attention,
Dellbert figures, because she is always surfing the Web wirelessly
for new recipes.
</P>
<P>
   These were a few of the visions evoked last week during a tour
of Dell Computer Corp.'s Holiday House, set up in a quiet red-brick
townhome at the Las Vegas Country Club, a mile or so from the din
of Comdex. The giant PC-industry trade show attracted more than
150,000 visitors and 2,100 companies, but Dell, following its
custom, did not have a big booth at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, the No. 1 personal computer maker in the United States,
rented the townhome to demonstrate how available technology from a
variety of hardware and software providers can establish
high-speed, local-area networks in any house. Dell has assembled
several PC packages with these features and more in time for the
holidays, ranging in price from $2,899 to $1,849. All include
56-kilobit Internet access from Dell for one year. Installation
costs and monthly fees for high speed Internet access via DSL or
cable systems are not included in those prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, whose vision includes fully functioning PCs throughout the
house, believes some type of desktop computer will become the nerve
center of Internet connectivity for households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and communication are coming together,'' said Ron
Van Dell, director of branding for Dell's Dimension, adding that
communication, or networking, means linking multiple PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are going to be able to do a lot more than they've
done in the past,'' he said, sitting in the living room of the
Holiday House with a lighted Christmas tree behind him. ``But that
freedom of choice brings a surprising degree of complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell believes it has solved that problem.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get into that, let's tour the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Dell's Inspiron notebook for consumers gets
Internet access through a wireless link to a Dimension, Dell's
consumer desktop PC, in the family room or living room. The
wireless network is based on a standard format known as 802.11 that
is effective up to 150 feet and can accommodate several PCs and
offer speeds of up to 11 megabits per second. The notebook with the
wireless network connection is expected next month. All other
features are available now.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension is connected by a VCR-type cable to a large-screen
TV that allows the TV to show a DVD movie running on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the notebook in the kitchen also could pick up the
movie. But encryption rules designed to prevent piracy forbid
transmission of digital content over the network, said Marc
Padovani, a Dell product-marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop whoever's in the kitchen from tapping into
holiday music from dozens of CDs whose contents are stored on the
Dimension's 13.6-gigabyte hard drive using MP3, a technology that
takes up less space. Using an easy-to-follow screen and software
from MusicMatch Jukebox, music stored on the hard drive is
accessible from any PC in the LAN, or local-area network. Music
also can be downloaded via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After storing music on one hard drive and backing it up on
another, these CDs could be stored in a closet, or even sold at a
used-CD store. Dell, however, isn't recommending that.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Dell house, every bedroom has a Dimension and big-screen
monitor. These upstairs PCs are linked to each other and the
downstairs Dimension in a high-speed network using existing
telephone wiring. That is a feature of pre-installed hardware from
3Com Corp. and software from Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   All desktop PCs in the house can share music and video files
stored anywhere, but parents can restrict access to files with
passwords.
</P>
<P>
   In their bedrooms, Dellbert and his sister, Dellila, can play
computer games with each other or send the full-color Christmas
lists to their parent's printer. They also can see each other
through small cameras on the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   With user-friendly software from Homestead.com, and Internet
access through Dell.com, Dell encourages consumers to build their
own Web pages. Home-movie clips or stills from digital cameras can
be added to the pages. For family and friends who prefer a hard
copy, a Sony Corp. recordable CD-ROM drive lets you put all that on
your customized CD.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds fun, but pretty darned complicated for the average
family, right? And we haven't even mentioned that existing
Dimensions in the house have to be upgraded to connect to the
network.
</P>
<P>
   The first test groups that Dell assembled when it was creating a
special CD to guide consumers through installation and set-up had a
perfect record _ of failure, said Van Dell, the branding director.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell believes it has made the process easy enough for a
family that doesn't know a LAN from a lunar lander to master
without anxiety. It now expects at least an 80 percent success
rate. ``It's not, `Where is our specialist in the neighborhood who
can help us?''' Van Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is perhaps one drawback that the computer maker
hasn't anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   With all the diversions available in Dell's wired house, parents
with children _ say, 3 and older _ might wonder how they'll get
everybody disconnected so the family can sit down together and
talk.

 &HT;    FileMaker Pro database program updated for network, Web use
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're an entrepreneur who needs to track clients
or a just a collector desperate for a way to catalog your holdings,
you might take a look at the latest version of FileMaker Pro.
</P>
<P>
   This venerable database program, controlled by Apple, lets you
create everything from client and product lists to CD catalogs,
address books, calendars and invoices _ whatever you need to track.
</P>
<P>
   With version 5.0, you can also share your address book with
others on a network or post a list of products or clients on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Database programs let you store and analyze any kind of
information. With these programs you can total up, say, sales in
the Midwest or every book in your collection written by Kurt
Vonnegut.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker Pro is considered an entry-level database for small
businesses, home users and work groups within a bigger company.
It's designed to be easy-to-use and understand without any
background in programming.
</P>
<P>
   No program meets this standard, but FileMaker Pro is pretty easy
to use and learn compared with most database programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with lots of templates that you can adopt as your
own. Better yet, the Internet and local bulletin boards are full of
templates users have built into FileMaker Pro and distributed for
others to use.
</P>
<P>
   While this program has been around for years, the latest version
includes several new features. For one, FileMaker Pro has been
redesigned to look and act more like the programs in Microsoft's
Office suite of software. You'll find menu toolbars and pop-up
context menus that resemble those in Office.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this redesign is to make FileMaker Pro familiar
and useful to a larger audience. Does it work? Only in part,
according to most reviewers. They found the mix of FileMaker Pro
styles and those of Microsoft confusing in spots.
</P>
<P>
   The program also goes too far at times in simplicity, crossing
over into ``dumbed-down.'' In the name of simplicity, for example,
FileMaker Pro includes only six fonts. It's a laborious procedure
to load in more.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any built-in programming language for power users.
That limits FileMaker Pro's appeal for bigger tasks such as running
a company's human resources department, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the program is receiving high marks for many of its
easy-to-use features. It's easy, for example, to create reports and
different ways to analyze and view information. The program walks
users through these things step-by-step through ``assistants,'' a
feature much like Microsoft's Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Another big plus is that, like Microsoft products, FileMaker Pro
works on both the Mac and PC platforms. That means databases
created in one platform will work in the other.
</P>
<P>
   FileMaker Pro retails for about $240, with the upgrade selling
for about $100 less.

 &HT;    Registering at retail sites can be the path to bargains
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This holiday season when you are shopping online, why
not opt to ``opt in?''
</P>
<P>
   Opting in is a high-tech way of saying that when you visit an
online retailer, you will check the little box on nearly every site
that asks if you'd like to be on its e-mail list.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a lot of people are thinking, ``What, check a box
that says, `Please send more junk mail spam to my e-mail account?'
No way, man.'' There's also an equally large group out there
saying, ``Hey, I value my privacy. I don't want some money-grubbing
retailer knowing everything about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for those two groups, there's just one thing to say: ``Get
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers want to be your friend. Well, they want you to
be their friend, anyway. They've read those Jupiter studies saying
online shoppers are going to leave somewhere in the neighborhood of
$6 billion at online checkout counters this holiday season. The
last thing they want to do is upset you and your disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   While they may wish they could invade your privacy, crawl into
your brain and rewire it so you will buy expensive things from them
in great quantities, they know you'd rather they didn't. They know
most shoppers don't want to give away much more information than an
e-mail address and possibly an area of interest, like women's
clothing or toys for toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers also have privacy policies that they don't have to
have, but prominently display in response to consumers' rightful
concerns that they'll distribute your name and credit card number
to every online con artist between here and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, online retailing was uncharted territory.
A few online retailers like Amazon.com or CDNow.com were selling
things, but unless you were a serious Web surfer, you had no idea
what they were and whether they were legitimate. Traditional
brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's or Tower Records were still
trying to figure out how to navigate the unfamiliar waters of
online retailing.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ads for online retailers during a National Football League
halftime show nearly outnumber ads for cars, beer and mutual funds,
and the companies advertising are stores like the Gap (www.gap.com)
and KB Toys (www.kbtoys.com), where consumers have been spending
money offline for years. They are not likely to run off with your
money or your credit card number if you decide to do business with
them online.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites just want your e-mail address, so they can try to
sell you more stuff more often. That's what they want when they ask
you to opt in. What you get is news of special offers that will
save you time and money. That's the real value of sharing
information with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to opt in, you will get a weekly or maybe a
monthly or even a less frequent e-mail from your favorite online
retailers advising you of what's new at their respective sites. The
types of offers can range from discounts to special offers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at CDNow, you'll find out when new releases are
going on sale, and you'll get coupons offering free shipping,
discounts or other special offers available only to the online
mailing list. Online clothing company Land's End (www.landsend
</P>
<P>
   .com) has a weekly overstocks newsletter of discounted
merchandise that you must visit the site and request. Major
airlines offer subscribers a weekly list of discounted Web fares.
Other sites, like the Bobbi Brown cosmetics site, will let you know
about special items that are only being sold online.
</P>
<P>
   During the holidays, when every dollar counts, e-mail bulletins
about shopping bargains and exclusives, shipping discounts or what
performances of the Nutcracker are still available Christmas week
can be handy.
</P>
<P>
   To drag out Martha Stewart's well-worn phrase: ``It's a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And remember, you can always chose to opt out.

 &HT;    Need for food is growing
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite a booming economy, more families will line up
at soup kitchens this year to celebrate Thanksgiving, according to
food banks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our requests for help are at an unprecedented level,'' said
Nancy Carrington, executive director of the Connecticut Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, food donations are down 15 percent this year. But
the demand for food has increased 30 percent during the last 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Food banks say more families are in need because they have been
removed from welfare rolls. During the last three years, 1.7
million families have stopped receiving financial support from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The government doesn't agree welfare reform has caused problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any real hard evidence that the changes in
welfare have resulted in a greater hunger or greater need for food
banks,'' said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE VOTERS DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government doesn't think you know enough about how it
works.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of students tested nationwide scored below ``basic''
knowledge about the government and the responsibilities of being a
citizen. Twenty-two thousand students in the fourth, eighth and
12th grades were tested last winter. The U.S. Department of
Education released the results last week.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-fourth of the test takers scored ``proficient'' or
``advanced'' in their understanding of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTION HIGH-FLYING FUN
</P>
<P>
   Look! Up in the sky _ it's a bird! It's a plane! It's a ride
that flies you around like Superman!
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest trend in amusement parks _ to be flown face-down
as though you were the Man of Steel. Two of these type rides, along
with many others, were on display at the International Association
of Amusement Parks and Attractions convention in Atlanta last week.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``flying'' rides, people are hoisted into the air and
zoom around in a circle, while they're fastened in face-down with
their feet dangling. The ride ``Fly Away,'' is made by a German
company; ``The Kite'' is made by an Italian company.

 &HT;    Putting on your PC
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thad Starner, one of the stars in the Georgia Tech
College of Computing, is easily recognized wherever he goes _ on
the campus or around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He is, depending on his operating base that day, the cool dude
in the computer glasses, or that nerd who wears his computer and
thinks everybody should. Either way, it's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   Starner, 30, has worn his computer virtually 24/7 since Dec. 11,
1996, when he was a student in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology media lab. He has become a national, yea, even an
international guru on wearable computers.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is not the only apostle, he is dubbed the pioneer by
the Financial Times of London and by other observers far and near.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to wear it, mostly because it makes more sense than a
desk computer,'' says Starner.
</P>
<P>
   You get his point when you learn that his wearable computer with
the viewing screen just an inch from his left eye allows him to
send and receive e-mail, browse the Internet or just read _ while
at the same time doing other duties, or just lying in the grass in
a park. He used the wearable computer to write his 250-page
doctoral thesis, astonishing when you consider the complex format,
footnotes, cross-references and minutiae that accompany such a
formal text.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing screen has remarkable clarity.
</P>
<P>
   With his computer in a pocket or in a shoulder bag, and sending
messages via his Twiddler, a nine-button, one-hand keyboard that
looks like an ocarina, Starner is in touch with a bottomless pool
of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview the other day, he startled me by addressing me
as if my life were an open book: ``Congratulations on your award
announced the other day ... that's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to me, my life WAS an open book. Even though he was
looking at me, he was also perusing a file of information about me
by way of his eye-level computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea Thad Starner is at one with his apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   His mission in life, Starner said, is to see the day a billion
people may be online, connected in wireless communication as he is
with his community of cyborg friends, as well as the rest of us on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be made possible by common, inexpensive pocket
computers, sophisticated enough to combine in one device all our
familiar things _ the calendar, the watch, the computer, the cell
phone and the word processor, all with wireless communication
capability,'' Starner said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it will be so basic that it can connect to
peripherals of your choice _ music player, video cameras or
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Starner, the evangelist, talk about his wireless
wearable computer:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is already much more than a computer as we usually
understand it. For instance, I read better on this computer than I
do using books. You know how reading in bed can be difficult,
trying to wrestle your way into a comfortable position with five
pounds of pages?
</P>
<P>
   ``With my computer, I read electronic versions of books lying in
bed at night, after my wife is asleep, there quietly in the
darkness. ... I format the pages so the lines are equal to my
reading style, which helps me to read fast and comfortably. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to bend down the pages to mark a favorite
passage. You do that electronically, or copy it and file it or
share it with somebody in an e-mail, all right there in the quiet
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have academic meetings, they like to make me the
secretary. I take notes as we go, highlighting what is important,
and when the meeting is over I offer everybody a copy of the
minutes, which I download to the printer in the room. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``No, my wife does not wear a computer, but in me she has a good
executive assistant. ... When she runs across something, a passage
in a book or whatever, she asks me to `file it,' and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The family that computes together ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his wearable computer is like a member of the family,
with special needs, all of which Starner has learned to
accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us 'borgs, the battery is a main concern,'' Starner
said. ``This is my approach. When I sleep, my battery sleeps; when
I eat, my battery eats (gets a charge). And that way we are both
ready at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal wearable computer, which Starner said could be as much
as two decades away, will be a machine that understands commands in
context, probably by voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be able to say `remind me about my meeting with Jonas
Tuesday at 3:30 at the office ... and let's include Fran and
Jennifer and Mark,' and the machine will know which Tuesday and the
place and the identity of Fran and Jennifer and Mark and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example, someone may place a call via the Internet,
only to have the machine say, ``Sorry, Thad is teaching right now,
but he has been waiting to talk to you. ... Please call back at
3:30, when he should have some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today Starner says he often boards a plane to keep an
appointment in another city with no record of specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can access a file at any time, either my
calendar or an e-mail message, that tells me exactly the time and
place and who will meet me or whatever,'' Starner said.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of steps between today's equipment and the point
where computers understand us and what we want in context, Starner
said, but that system will take shape, bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   He did not add that even though he foresees 20 years in the
development, these things occur at an accelerating pace.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it ever occurred to him to wear a computer, Starner
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in ninth grade when I asked my father for an answer to
a trigonometry question. He said that, even though he used trig
every day, he had forgotten much of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, I couldn't understand how my father could have
forgotten such useful training. I learned the value of staying in
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first idea that the interface might be interesting was when
watching a science fiction movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Starner is operating personally on the edge of science
fiction, and always in touch.

 &HT;    When hard work doesn't pay offBy Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Todd Rogers' story is one you don't hear very
often in a town like Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he quit his job and became a high-tech entrepreneur.
But he didn't become a member of one of Central Texas' growing
league of overnight high-tech millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' company, which developed software for veterinary
clinics, failed. Today, nearly a year later, he's still paying off
debts. He drives a Honda Accord, not a Porsche. He doesn't live in
a mansion. And he's back working for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was to write a really nice piece of software that
people would use,'' says Rogers, 29. ``But there were a lot of
things I didn't take into account. Nothing went as planned. We had
a lot of bad luck. And we made a lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the visible success of Austin's high-tech industry, the
truth is that far more tech upstarts fail than succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody tracks how many high-tech companies go under annually,
but venture capitalists use a formula for assessing the odds. It's
called the four-three-three, and it assumes that of every 10
companies that raise money, four will fail quickly, three will fail
slowly, three will survive, and hopefully one of those three
survivors will be a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear so much about the huge successes that we forget that
there are many more startups that sink,'' says Kirk Walden,
national director of venture capital research for the
PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. ``Every entrepreneur has a
chance to fail or succeed, and failure is a heck of a lot more
common.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Rogers' company sank in late 1998 after a two-year
struggle. Eighty-hour weeks produced solid software and a handful
of loyal clients. But that wasn't enough to make up for a small
market, a chronic shortage of cash and poor marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers poured $140,000 in savings into the company before it
closed. What he has to show for it today is stacked in the garage
of his Southwest Austin home: Boxes and boxes of unused CD-ROMs and
worthless stock options. ``You never hear about the other side of
startups,'' says Rogers, who, with his boyish smile and
close-cropped hair, could be played by actor Chris O'Donnell if
they made a movie about his defeat. ``It's kind of the untold part
of the high-tech story that a lot of us have lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, like last week when a surprise $200 tax bill arrived
from the comptroller's office, Rogers regrets ever having dared to
launch his company, Tower Software Inc. But other days he's more
philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent hours and hours thinking about it,'' say Rogers,
who is now a consultant at a software services company. ``I've
beaten myself up over it. But now I'm realizing that I probably
learned more from failing than if it had succeeded. I've grown up a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Destiny of a company
</P>
<P>
   If Rogers' decision to start his own company can be traced to
one thing, it's boredom.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 1995 with a
degree in computer engineering, he joined a software contractor
doing data modeling and analysis for General Motors Corp.'s Saturn
division in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a job, just a job,'' he says. ``You never felt like you
were having an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He had toyed with starting his own company, but never had an
idea that felt right. Then he got a call from his brother, a
veterinarian in Hawaii. All the software for managing vet clinics
was lousy and expensive, he complained. Why don't you come up with
something better?
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Rogers began researching the market. It seemed ideal
_ 35,000 to 40,000 veterinary clinics in the United States, and a
handful of small companies selling behind-the-times software
(mostly based on the ancient DOS platform).
</P>
<P>
   ``The software was four to five years behind, techwise,'' Rogers
says. ``I mean, the stuff was crummy.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption that veterinarians wanted something snazzier was
his first mistake. ``The thing I didn't anticipate was the vets
being completely unreceptive to new technology. Looking back, I
realize that just because I could write software using Delphi (a
programming language) didn't mean anyone would buy it. At the time,
though, it seemed like I had stumbled across a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   During his year as a programmer, Rogers had stashed away $70,000
for graduate school. A zooming stock market sent his savings
soaring to $140,000. He had paid off his car, and could live for
free in a mobile home on some property his parents owned in Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Tower Software was born.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers went to work pounding out code from the mobile home,
later from a rented house with a roommate and finally from free
office space at the Texas Dental Association he got in exchange for
doing computer consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go out and socialize, I didn't do anything but sit in
front of the computer and code for six months,'' says Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   He recruited an old friend, Chris Jackson, to move from Houston
to be his partner, and the two proudly visited their first vet
clinic to test the software, which manages vet medical records.
They chose the Houston clinic where Rogers' family had taken its
ducks, rabbits, cats and dogs for years. They left humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just tore the thing to shreds,'' Rogers says. ``I was
just so way off in terms of usability. It was useless.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time around, the two spent nights at an emergency
animal clinic watching how workers entered data and used their
software. Days were spent doing a massive software rewrite. Six
months later, they were ready to face the vets again. This time
they worked closely with three clinics _ in Austin, Schertz and
Houston _ to make sure the software did what it should.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Dr. Corky Trlica of Travis Country Veterinary
Hospital, took a special interest in Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked their entrepreneurial spirit,'' he says. ``I don't
have computer experience, and they helped me learn it. In exchange,
I was hoping I could help them build the software from a vet
standpoint. Usually, it's the computer monkeys that design the
systems, and then us knothead vets have to try to learn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trlica says he was impressed by the software, but skeptical of
Tower's viability. ``The system was pretty bulletproof, it was the
best I had seen. But I kept asking them if you sell 10 of these a
month can you make a living? I didn't see how they could keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was wondering the same thing. He hadn't taken a salary in
24 months, the company had burned through $70,000 and it was
gearing up to spend thousands more on direct mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Rogers and Jackson estimated they could live on
selling four or five copies a month (at $2,000 to $3,000 per
clinic). But even after sending out 300 demos and getting positive
response from ads in vet trade magazines, sales were slow.
</P>
<P>
   The thing Rogers didn't realize, Trlica says, is that vets don't
like change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd misjudged the marketplace, and how conservative this
business is,'' Trlica says. ``Vets as a rule don't go for the
latest and greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tower ``would sell a couple copies, then a couple
more, but we weren't selling enough to cover our expenses,'' Rogers
says. ``It was getting really old not having a paycheck. We were
sinking our hearts into it and getting nothing back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers knew he desperately needed to invest heavily in direct
marketing and hire a full-time salesperson to work the phones all
day _ but he couldn't afford either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with some venture capitalists, but our market was too
small to interest them,'' he says. ``Finally, we sat down and said
`We have no money. Let's find a competitor who has really crappy
software and sell them ours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another six months was spent negotiating a promising deal with a
software company, but in the end they couldn't agree on a price. A
phone conversation with a friend in Houston is what finally
convinced Rogers it was time to rethink his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked how my relationship with my wife was and I realized
our marriage was kind of decaying,'' he says. ``That was when I
realized I could find another job, but I could never find another
Erin. It became really clear that this wasn't going to cut it. It
was time to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Tower Software closed for good.
</P>
<P>
   THE AFTERMATH
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, pulling the plug felt like a huge relief to
Rogers. But then came the pain: Sending out resumes to get another
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was finally admitting that Tower was over,'' says Rogers.
``I kept thinking about the people who had spent their money on our
software, and how they believed in us, and we were letting them
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower found a software consulting company that agreed to take
over its 12 customers. Recently, he put his software up for sale on
online auction site eBay Inc. He says he got a bite, which he hopes
may still pan out.
</P>
<P>
   Failure didn't hurt when it came to job hunting. Jackson got a
job designing computer networks for Temple-Inland Corp., and Rogers
was hired quickly by Catapult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high-tech, failure isn't a stigma,'' says Walden of
PriceWaterhouseCoopers. ``Tech companies would rather see someone
who struggled to get a business off the ground than someone who sat
in a cubicle for 20 years. It's all about `What did you learn?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' list of lessons is long.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I realized is that hard work in software is about half of
what you need to make something successful. The other part is good
management and good marketing,'' he says. ``I should have spent
more time studying the industry, and I needed to hire people rather
than do it all myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 months since Tower went out of business, Rogers has
supplemented his Catapult income by working nights as a software
contractor to pay off debts. This year he settled $10,000 in
Tower-related debt, and has another $3,500 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Filing for bankruptcy crossed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally we could have blown it all off,'' he says. ``But I
teach a Bible study to high school kids, and I can't go in there
and tell them all this stuff about honesty and not be living it.''
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, and the disappointment fades, Rogers is
beginning to understand that he met more goals than he initially
realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to be a millionaire,'' says Rogers. ``What I
dreamed about was seeing someone use something that came out of my
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget walking into a vet's office and seeing a
receptionist using our system. She wasn't complaining or anything.
She was just using it to get stuff done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the coolest moment, and it's what I want to remember
about Tower Software.''

 &HT;    Microsoft continues innovative streak with new real-time game
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News ServiceFOR THE DESKTOP
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say what you will about Microsoft _ it continues to
revolutionize gaming with its quality peripherals and great games.
So what if its latest, Age of Empires II ($50 for the PC), is yet
another in a long line of real-time strategy games? The company
gets it right, improving upon a great product and introducing
compelling campaigns, including a brilliant William Wallace
training scenario and the rise of Joan of Arc. While Age of Empires
took you through the beginnings of civilization, Age of Empires II
propels you from the fall of Rome to the Middle Ages. The game's
got better intelligence, more tactical options and better stories.
One of the truly best empire-building games around.

   _ Madden football is like Thanksgiving leftovers. No matter what
you do, you know it's coming, and you know there's nothing you'll
be able to do about it. For the past few years, PC football games
have improved dramatically in graphics and game-play, led by folks
like EA Sports. This year's Madden 2000 ($40) is graphics- and
feature-rich, but unfortunately it just can't compete with the
intuitiveness and game-play of some of its console brethren.
Multiplayer and updated stats are standard fare for Madden games,
but 2000 has a few new features, such as an arcade mode that
emulates NFL Blitz. Harder hits and tired ``edgy'' commentary,
however, don't add up to Blitz's fun. And the game is glitchy,
causing strange crashes and errors on some 3dfx graphics cards and
often inexplicably starting the game with teams different than
those you selected. The graphics are ho-hum and the game-play
hasn't advanced much from last year. With games like Sega's amazing
NFL2K blazing trails on the console side, this may not be the best
year for Madden pound cake.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Just so you know, the first Nyko Scorpion Playstation controller
($30) I was sent had a screw missing in the handle. The apologies
were profuse and I was immediately sent another one (they assured
me it was an anomaly). Workmanship aside, this is an amazing
controller. If you're like me, you've been complaining about the
size of the Playstation controller since it came out. The Sony dual
shock controller added some heft, but it was still pretty small in
the hand. Nyko has worked to eradicate that with the Scorpion. The
controller is wider (looking like a cross between a stingray and
Klingon battle cruiser) and fits in the hand better. Also, the
controller puts those hard-to-reach R2, L2 buttons within reach,
which really helps on the sports games. The controller also comes
with turbo (speeds things up) and slow (exactly what it sounds
like) modes for the cheater in you. (www.nyko.com)

 &HT;    Barney gets in on bongo act

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's amazing that anything with Barney's mug on
it still exists. There was a time where the purple dinosaur
inspired rage and social backlash. Now, it's the opposite. Barney
is back in favor, in part because of cool toys such as Barney's
Song Magic Bongos ($30). The Magic Bongos play 11 songs on five
different instruments. All kids have to do is pick their song (i.e.
``Farmer in the Dell'' among others) and an instrument, ranging
from a steel drum to a hooting organ sound, and start bonging away.
Each hit yields a note and, following that principle, a bunch of
notes/hits play a song. This toy is great for those creative kids
just starting to attain their dexterity, and is also good for
celebrities who insist on dancing around their homes naked.

travel through five different eras in order to get back to the

   Uncle Albert is a little touched in the head (we'll just

Mac), you can look through Albert's scrapbook and piece together an
assortment of puzzles by flipping through pages and putting items
in the right places; if you find a key you can unlock the
rocketship game and go on a space journey. Find the picture of the
champ and you can play in the stadium. The game, a best-seller in
France, is handily adapted to the U.S. and runs on Windows PCs and
Macs. It features many small films, eight individual games and a
host of animal friends to play with. (www.vtechsoft.com/album.html)

   BRAINS, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

   Do you remember those family vacations when mom and dad would
pack up the kids and a Styrofoam cooler full of bologna sandwiches
and store-brand cola, heading off at 5 a.m. for parts unknown? Do
you fondly recall pelting your parents with countless questions en
route to your destination?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Brain Quest series ($30, PC and Mac) lets your own
kids take that trip, albeit virtually, as tagalongs with the
Perdido family in its brain-powered vacation van. Better the
Perdido's than you, eh? ``Alas,'' you think, ``my kids are getting
their question-and-answer fix somewhere else. Our trips to the
grocery store will be peaceful and question-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And the computerized queries go well beyond the classic, ``Are
we there yet?'' In fact, the engaging program quizzes kids with
thousands of puzzlers in math, science, language arts and social
studies, each grade-tailored correct answer moving the van forward
toward their reward: a postcard of the Perdidos at their vacation
destination.
</P>
<P>
   With an Internet connection, Brain Quest variations include
multiplayer game modes and help with answers via the World Book
online encyclopedia. For a fee, extra game packs with more
questions can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, beware: Each Brain Quest title includes a booklet of
bound cards with trivia questions on all 50 states, meaning the
Q-and-A can continue far away from the keyboard. Better brush up on
your U.S. trivia _ looks like those shopping trips won't be so
peaceful after all.

 &HT;    Online help for holiday overeaters
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday is when we start packing it on. Thanksgiving
usually heralds the beginning of the heavy eating season. From
there, it's one long month of holiday parties, Christmas-colored
M&AMP;M's and mall fast-food _ a big, sugar-coated slide toward a New
Year's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.phys.com, offers an attempt at moderation. The
site contains information about nutrition, weight loss and
pregnancy. But this fall, it has started a holiday survival guide
designed to get you to perhaps drop that second chalupa.
</P>
<P>
   The average person gains at least five pounds during the
holidays, according to phys.com's dietician. The survival guide's
goal is to keep you from overeating and to squeeze in some
occasional exercise along with that last cookie.
</P>
<P>
   The site is geared toward women between 20 and 40, but features
such as calorie counters and calorie-burners could be worthwhile
for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION SITE RESPONDS TO POKEMON SCARCITY
</P>
<P>
   They're as freaky looking as Teletubbies, and the movie
apparently is awful, but kids love Pokemon, the furry Japanese
pocket monsters, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a parent to do this holiday season? Stand in line at
the toy store like you did for Cabbage Patch Kids, Tickle Me Elmo
dolls and Furbys?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, those lines led to a few fistfights and some nice
economics lessons. Toy demand was greater than toy supply, so
instant auctions were started, with people offering way more than
face value for a tangible piece of pop culture history.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, people are getting a head start on what
is expected to be a sought-after, and fought-after, item this year.
</P>
<P>
   An auction Web site, www
</P>
<P>
   .pokemonnation.com, has more than 1,500 Pokemon items for sale.
Signing up for the site costs nothing. Membership lets you buy,
sell or trade Pokemon merchandise. Pokemon e-mail accounts are
available, as are trading boards and chat rooms. The site also
includes a Pokemon glossary to help tell the difference between the
150 characters.
</P>
<P>
   PokemonNation.com is a subsidiary of CollectingNation.com, a
Connecticut-based auction site.

<P>
   WEB-A-THON ASSISTS AILING GARY COLEMAN
</P>
<P>
   Gary Coleman, the former actor who once sought your viewing
attention on TV's ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' now wants your money.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old, once worth $18 million, filed for bankruptcy in
August. Now he's selling stuff from a Web site, webathon.ugo.com/,
to help pay his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the public relations firm representing UGO
Networks, the Web site sponsoring the auction, told the Reuters
news service that the site had Coleman's approval and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot, 8-inch Coleman suffers from end-stage renal disease
and requires kidney dialysis three times a week. In an August
interview, Coleman said the treatments helped drain his bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the star of the former NBC sitcom will be able to donate
money and bid for Coleman's personal items, including an
autographed spatula, a natty, pin-striped suit and an ice scraper.
Donors are eligible to receive such items as Gary Coleman votive
candles, Gary Coleman Zippo lighters and Gary Coleman commemorative
plates, featuring a picture of Coleman and Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The site features Gary Grooves, a three-dimensional image of
Gary dancing to house music. Visitors to the site can register for
a $1,000 shopping spree with Coleman tagging along to help.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is a pop-up timeline that lets site visitors
follow key events in Coleman's life, complete with images and text.
Key moments include:
</P>
<P>
   _ May 1978. The series pilot, ``45 Minutes from Harlem,'' is
shot. The show is picked up, renamed ``Diff'rent Strokes'' and
starts airing on NBC that November.
</P>
<P>
   _ November 1984. Coleman has his second kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 15, 1999. The Gary Coleman Celebrity Web-a-thon kicks
off.

 &HT;    Adobe kit the ultimate for Web page design
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you intend to go into Web site production in a big
way, consider a new Adobe package called Web Collection, built
around the firm's redoubtable Photoshop image-control program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Photoshop 5, the collection includes Illustrator
8, for creating your own drawings and images, ImageStyler for
creating even fancier objects and GoLive, Adobe's Web page editor.
</P>
<P>
   For most folks, this package constitutes major overkill. It is
intended for professionals, and one way or another it will do
everything imaginable in terms of creating a Web page or a major
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who haven't been into computers for long, or
haven't been paying attention, Adobe Systems sprang to life within
the Macintosh world with its venerable page layout program
PageMaker and is still centered there. All these programs have been
ported to the PC system for years now, but for PC users the
dichotomy will present a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Adobe programs don't use a second mouse button,
let alone a third, is not so bothersome as the manuals, which are
exceedingly complete but intended to serve both masters. Thus, many
of the instructions are issued twice _ here's how you do it on the
PC, and here's how you do it on the Mac. This inevitably becomes
confusing and also accounts to a degree for the bulky manuals. The
problem seems somewhat more obvious in GoLive, perhaps because this
is its first appearance in the Windows world.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop, which is by far and away the most popular of
professional photograph manipulation programs, and Illustrator have
been around for a long time, as their version numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Since GoLive is new to to the PC platform and is, after all, the
program that will be used to get all the fancy pictures up and
running on the Internet, I concentrated on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a former Mac-only program called GoLive CyberStudio,
acquired by Adobe to give it an entry in the high-end Web design
field.
</P>
<P>
   The layout of a page in GoLive is much more like working in a
standard layout program than any site editor I've used. The page
construction screen uses a grid for precise layout and as an
alternative offers to set up columns and rows as the user wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Images and text can be dragged and dropped from various
palettes. It offers a dozen working JavaScript functions and a
movie editor (for Quicktime flicks) for enhancing a page with
action.
</P>
<P>
   Like its companion pieces, GoLive is an enormous and complex
program. Inevitably, complexity steepens the learning curve, and
GoLive's is steep indeed. The manual runs over 400 pages, and it
will be fairly dog-eared before a serious user is fully comfortable
with the program. In the course of it, the user can expect to
become more familiar with HTML code operations, which underly all
Web pages, than with most lower-end programs. That, of course, is
to be expected also.
</P>
<P>
   GoLive is a direct challenge to Microsoft's FrontPage, and while
it may very well do more _ I haven't looked at FrontPage's last
couple of iterations _ it is not as intuitive and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, GoLive costs about $300. The powerhouse, four-program
Web Collection runs over $1,000.

 &HT;    In diagnosing computer woes, start with last change made
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If your television broke down as often as most
computers, you'd have a lot more quality time to spend with your
family.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail from across the country, half of which
asks for advice on how to fix something that has gone wrong with a
computer. I'm not a computer genius, but even if I were, I'd have a
hard time fixing these problems remotely. I'm in the same position
as an auto mechanic who gets a phone call demanding to know what's
wrong when the family car makes a chuga-woo-chercuck noise as it
goes up steep hills.
</P>
<P>
   There are some methods you can use at home that will help you
find _ and maybe even fix _ some computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know about computers is that _ unlike with
your car _ the most likely suspect is not a hardware failure.
Obviously it happens, but it's not the best assumption to start
with. Instead, start by being a detective. Think back to the last
change you made to your computer before it began to malfunction.
Anything from a new computer program, to an updated browser, to a
new modem or scanner, or even changes to an existing program can be
(and often is) the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine at work recently profited by that type of
thinking. His printer stopped working. He fussed and fooled and
fulminated with settings and controls until he walked away and
started thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered that he had just installed a new word
processor. There is no logical reason that should cause a printer
to stop working, but it was his best clue. So he removed the word
processor (using the Windows uninstall program you'll find under
the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel).
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't know why the word processor (WordPerfect)
caused the problem, but he doesn't care. Unless you are a computer
technician, you probably shouldn't care either. He just knows his
computer works OK now, and he will call Corel, the publisher of
WordPerfect, to get advice on how to reinstall the word processor
correctly. He has important information in hand. He knows what is
wrong. Without that information, it's impossible to fix a lamp, a
car or a computer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be times _ plenty of them _ when you can't find a
logical suspect for the computer's behavior. You'll swear nothing
has changed, and you'll want to blame something trendy like a
virus. Viruses are real but _ at least in my experience _ they
aren't the most likely cause of an unknown problem. But if you want
to reduce the odds that a virus is the culprit, get a good
anti-virus program and use it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've ruled out a recent change in your computer and a
virus, what do you do next?
</P>
<P>
   The smart next step is to go to the Device Manager you'll find
under the System icon to see if Windows can help. In many cases, it
will flag a conflict between two devices (when two gizmos try to
share the same computer address they make cruddy roommates). If you
find an exclamation mark like this ! beside a device, that's an
excellent clue. Windows has a help feature that will guide you
through fixing the problem it finds (although I'll have to admit
that the prose is pretty thick if you aren't a techie).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if all else fails, consider reinstalling Windows.
Sometimes things get so messed up that only a reinstall will fix
them (unless you have the time and the skill to pinpoint the
problem).
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggest editing a file that Windows calls the
Registry, but I shy away from that. But since I am not always
right, my advice is to read a good book on Windows (something other
than the manual that comes with it) and make up your own mind when
it comes to editing the Registry file (which keeps track of almost
every setting in your computer).
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, do as a good physician would. Don't try
something that can make something worse. If you're stuck and in
over your head, do one thing. Call an expert and get some help.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: In a recent paper there is a picture of a
sprinkler made of copper pipe which becomes a swirling, functional
sculpture when the water is turned on. Would you please find out
how and where I can purchase one? _ Cynthia Ann Leach
</P>
<P>
   A: That copper sprinkler was created from a custom kit by Dream
Sprayer. The company produces several styles of sprayers with
spirals as well as the kit to design your own. Kits are $79 and
include all the components a creative gardener needs. All thumbs?
Ready-made copper sprinklers are $189-$249 and arrive with the
three-prong base you need to support the water art work. Contact
Dream Sprayer at (920) 494-3430 or check out the company's Web page

   Q: My sister plans to be married in Italy. She wants my children
to be in her wedding. At the time of the wedding one will be 7, the
other, 21 months. What are the rules concerning passports? I have
seen passport pictures with a mother and child together. At what
age should a child receive his own? _ J. Little
</P>
<P>
   A: Break out the forms, Mom, you are applying for passports for
these kiddos. ``All persons including newborn infants are required
to obtain passports in their own names,'' according to U.S. Postal
Service spokeswoman Barbara Pokorny. Postal stations provide
passport services. For those 15 years and younger, passports are
valid for five years; for 16 years and older, 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me why Matthew McConaughey seems to have a
sideline pass to every UT home football game? He was even on the
sidelines at the Texas-OU game in the Cotton Bowl. It's true that
he's not bad to look at down there, and since he stands right in
front of our section most of the time, we do get a pretty good
view. But how does he rate such special treatment? _ Dianne Brode
</P>
<P>
   A: McConaughey falls into the special guests category along with
other University of Texas Longhorn fans such as Ben Crenshaw, Lance
Armstrong, Darrell Royal and Earl Campbell, according to sports
department spokesman Bill Little. You may have seen them pacing the
sidelines also. All-access passes are issued by the UT Athletic
Department football office. Perhaps your son will be down there
among the glitterati one day. Q: My son is getting married in the
spring and I have purchased a double wedding-ring quilt for their
wedding gift. I would like to include the history of the quilt as
part of the gift. Could you help me find the history?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathy Holland
</P>
<P>
   A: The double wedding-ring quilt appeared as early as 1870 but
did not come into popularity until 1925-30, says third-generation
Texas quilt-maker Kathleen McCrady. This is a difficult pattern _
not for the novice quilter. In the late 1920s, patterns were
published making such patterns easier to execute. Other popular
patterns of this era are Sunbonnet Sue, Dresden Plate and
Grandmother's Flower Garden. No one knows the exact origin of the
double wedding-ring quilt, but it is a traditional newlywed
present. The interlocking rings are reminders of new connections
and promises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which is correct: ``Fleshed out'' or ``Flushed out,'' as in
an issue? I hear both terms used. (Flushed out makes more sense to
me.) And while I am at it, where did ``early on'' come from and
what in the world does ``arguably'' mean? _ David Beard
</P>
<P>
   A: You've been reading too many William Safire ``On Language''
columns. Grammar guru John Mark Rogers at the University of Texas
Writing Center tackled your query. ``Flesh out,'' as in an issue,
is correct. The phrase conjures putting meat on a skeleton, or
filling in an outline for a topic. ``Early on'' is an informal
usage in which ``on'' is superfluous. Use it in conversation _ if
you must _ in lieu of ``early'' or ``earlier.'' For the adverb
``arguably,'' Rogers suggests this meaning, ``openly debatable
among experts.''

   _ Reader Jamie R. Oliver, vice president of the Central Texas
Chapter, Employee Assistance Professional's Association, offers
details on dealing with workplace violence. ``Any organization of
size should have a 'Zero Tolerance' policy on threats of violence
in the workplace to go along with similar policies on alcohol/drug
abuse and sexual harassment/discrimination,'' notes Oliver. The
policy should include who receives the report (e.g. supervisor,
human resources, security) and what form the report should take.
Procedures should be in place for investigation and documentation
of threats as well as subsequent discipline if warranted.

 &HT;    Meet the people who lived in Georgia long before us
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thanksgiving week is when many Americans think about
the Indians who helped Pilgrims from England through those first
harsh winters. But it's not the only time we can appreciate Native
American culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   A new exhibit at the Atlanta History Center celebrates those
first inhabitants of America and focuses on the tribes of Georgia.
It will be at the center for a year.
</P>
<P>
   NFK visited the exhibit, which is called ``Native Lands: Indians
and Georgia.'' Here's some of the cool stuff we learned:
</P>
<P>
   WHO LIVED HERE?
</P>
<P>
   The Native Americans who lived in Georgia were the
Mississippians, and later the Creeks and Cherokees. The
Mississippians were here from the years 900 to 1600. They built
great Indian mounds and surrounded them with their towns. Some
towns had populations in the thousands. By the early 1700s, many of
their descendants had become members of the Creek Confederacy and
lived throughout most of what is now Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another group of descendants, the Cherokees,
lived in the southern Appalachian Mountains, which are in northern
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT LANGUAGES DID THEY SPEAK?
</P>
<P>
   The Creeks spoke many languages and dialects, including
Muscogee, Hitchitii, Yuchee and Shawnee. The Cherokees spoke one
language: Iroquoian. Their ancestors, the Mississippians, spoke
many languages, but the names aren't recorded in history.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DID THEY CELEBRATE?
</P>
<P>
   The Green Corn Festival was the Creeks' and Cherokees' most
important religious tradition. They held the sacred festival every
year at harvest time, and it lasted for days.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time for prayers, dances, songs, telling stories and
predicting the future. People forgave each other for wrongdoings,
and they destroyed things used in the previous year, such as
pottery, food and clothing. Women harvested corn and vegetables,
and hunters brought game for a feast.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SPORTS DID THEY PLAY?
</P>
<P>
   A ballgame called ``Little Brother of War'' trained young men to
be warriors. Players used two sticks with pockets at the ends to
carry and throw a deer-hide-covered ball as they ran down a field.
They could not touch the ball with their hands. A team scored when
a player hurled the ball between the other team's goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   The game was rough. The players could hit each other with their
sticks and do just about anything else to stop the other team. The
game helped settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WAS PART OF THE FAMILY?
</P>
<P>
   Every Creek and Cherokee belonged to a ``clan,'' a large
extended family. Children inherited their clan from their mother _
and with it certain traditions, dances, prayers and jobs. If
someone was sick or old or lost their home, the clan took care of
them. Everyone in the clan helped raise the children. By the early
1800s, seven clans existed among the Cherokee: Blue, Long Hair,
Bird, Paint, Deer, Wild Potato and Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TRIBES?
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippians suffered from epidemics, warfare and
enslavement by Europeans and other Native Americans. Their first
contact with the Europeans was in the 1500s, and because they had
no immunity to European diseases, whole towns and villages died.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Creeks and Cherokees were pressured to leave their
native lands and move west. By 1826, Georgia had evicted the Creek
Nation. In 1838, U.S. troops rounded up the Cherokees and forced
them to go west. The Trail of Tears was a forced march that lasted
116 days and took the Cherokees to Oklahoma. By 1840, almost no
Creek or Cherokee people remained in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE ARE THEY TODAY?
</P>
<P>
   The descendants of the Creeks and Cherokees who had to leave

<P>
   www.turkeyfed.org _ Let's talk turkey. In fact, let's surf for
turkeys. The National Turkey Federation knows its white meat from
its drumstick. The massive site includes consumer and food service
recipes, many ``frequently asked questions'' on turkey buying and
monthly special guest chefs who trot out their turkey best. A nice
Thanksgiving spread's-worth of information.
</P>
<P>
   www.tznet.com/lwittman/turkey.html _ Why roast that turkey when
you can deep-fry it, Cajun-style, adding even more calories to your
Thanksgiving feast? ``Jim's Cajun Deep-Fried Turkey Page'' guides
you step-by-step through the deep-frying process from the initial
dip to the final presentation.
</P>
<P>
   www.canturkey.ca/trivia.htm _ Turkey facts: ``The domestic
turkey is descended from wild turkeys originally native to Southern
Ontario, parts of the U.S. and Mexico. The turkey was tamed by the
American Indian cultures in Mexico and taken from Mexico to Europe
by Spanish conquistadors early in the 16th century.'' That's just
some of what you'll find at the Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency's
Trivia Page.
</P>
<P>
   www.benjerry.com/thanksgiving/index.html _ Ben and Jerry's
Thanksgiving page will stuff you as surely as their ice cream does.
A huge variety of Thanksgiving activities, games, screen savers,
desktop patterns, history, links and background are as filling as
Cherry Garcia.

how this whole Thanksgiving business got started. Check out Lisa
Mitten's award-winning site, which includes links to Native
American artists, programs, cultural centers and information
resources. And then, let's give thanks to the Internet for making
it all possible.

 &HT;    Glued to the tube with thanks By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ In this holiday season,
<TEXT>
let us pause and consider the tuber that is neither mashed nor
sweet. Let us consider the faithful boob tuber, which has no
calories but still makes us fat ...
<P>
   TV TO BE THANKFUL FOR
</P>
<P>
   1. Aaron Sorkin _ Enough already about David E. Kelley. The
smartest shows on the networks this season belong to Sorkin, who
came to TV from big-screen scripting (``A Few Good Men,'' ``The
American President'') to concoct last year's ``Sports Night'' for
ABC and this fall's ``The West Wing'' on NBC. The ambivalent
romance between Casey and Dana on ``Sports Night'' is the hot
button this season, but the
</P>
<P>
   real love affair is the deep friendship between Casey and Dan.
An episode of ``The West Wing'' dealing with the politics swirling
around a gun-control bill showed the agony and the reality of
turning ideals into law. Unlike the creations of another famous
Aaron (that would be Spelling), these programs are not cotton
candy. They're Power Bars. ``Sports Night,'' by the way, returns
Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Simpsons'' _ For nearly a decade, Matt Groening has
made us groan, wince and howl _ but we've never been bored. In a
recent inspired moment, Homer, who never met a fat gram or a
calorie he didn't like, asks to have hot butter poured on his Milk
Duds at the movies. Still surprising after all these years, a
rarity on TV.
</P>
<P>
   3. Original movies on HBO and TNT _ While the broadcast networks
have sunk to endless rape and murder flicks, the cable channels are
turning out thoughtful movies. ``The Sopranos'' has gotten all the
press this season for HBO, but let's not forget the quality of the
network's original movies. The latest is ``RKO 281,'' a fascinating
look at the making of ``Citizen Kane'' and the strange convergence
of two legendary titans, Orson Welles and publisher William
Randolph Hearst, on whose life Kane was based. James Cromwell is an
against-type choice to play Hearst _ a risk the Big Three would
never take.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bill Moyers _ Ignore the bogus flap over the funding of
Moyers' projects. He is incapable of selling out to anybody. The
commercial networks aren't going to devote an hour or two to
campaign finance reform, the Constitution or ``Amazing Grace.''
This season's ``Fooling With Words,'' about the art of poetry, was
an offbeat look at literary creation. Let Peter, Dan and Tom handle
the plane crash headlines. Moyers is a master at making us think
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   TV TURKEYS
</P>
<P>
   1. Newsmagazines _ Why is it that every newsmagazine except ``60
Minutes'' feels compelled to run stories on murders, bigamists and
mothers who cause horrible illnesses in their children? ``Dateline
NBC'' seems to run the same murder story five times a week,
distinguishing a few by calling them ``interactive'' and asking
viewers to vote guilty or not guilty online. With a dozen hours of
these shows a week, we're stuffed to the hurling point with these
tasteless turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whiny, sex-obsessed twentysomethings _ These folks are
annoying in real life and they're annoying on TV. The good news is
ABC's ``Wasteland'' is gone; the bad news is a bunch of new ones
are scheduled to arrive midseason. The WB has an hourlong drama,
``DC,'' and the sitcom ``Zoe'' in the works; and CBS is grasping
for youth with a Miami-based comedy called ``Grapevine.'' Maybe the
newcomers won't whine, but I wouldn't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Wrestling _ I don't care if it is just campy theater, it's
grotesque. And after years of being banished to cable, wrestling
has crept onto a broadcast network this fall in the ugly form of
``WWF Smackdown.'' These pumped up, greased down growlers appeal to
something lower than the lowest common denominator, and in an
effort to out-do each other, they've become more violent. This fall
alone there were two paralyzing accidents in the ring. Put on some
clothes and get a real job, guys.
</P>
<P>
   4. E! Entertainment Television _ Farm out ``Talk Soup,'' the
only decent program on the network, to Comedy Central and close
this operation down. Just because ``Entertainment Tonight'' is a
hit in syndication doesn't mean this stuff should be on 24 hours a
day. A typical day's lineup includes ``Scandals,'' ``Celebrity
Profile'' (featuring such A-listers as Melissa Gilbert and Charlie
Sheen) and the ultra-crude ``Howard Stern.'' Eeeee-yow!
</P>
<P>
   5. The new game shows _ OK, everybody's watching ``Who Wants To
Be A Millionaire.'' Four of the latest episodes were in the top 10
and all seven were in the top 20. But this is really hokey stuff.
Regis Philbin's breathless excitement, the pulsating music, the
hand-flapping-lip-sweating contestants, the squealing studio
audience. It's all just too much. And those questions: How many
teaspoons in a tablespoon? Which state capital is at the highest
altitude? Not that the questions are all easy. They're just random
trivia. It's a testimony to how tired viewers are of regular fare
that this show is such a hit.

Tech computer guru. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution )
Art includes one 4-column color photo of man wearing computer
glasses and a 1-column photo of complete personal computer system.

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Better products are created by the marketplace,

<P>
   GAME CORNER _ Fishing for a new game? This video game features
everything but the smell of the trout. (Staff, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   MARS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Mars is just a bright dot in the sky on a
starry night, but personal computers and the Internet have brought
the Red Planet as close as your keyboard. Most space missions now
have at least one, and sometimes many, Internet sites, and the
large number of missions aimed at Mars in recent years has caused a
proliferation of sites for the fourth rock from the sun. (Gaffney,
Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   DELLHOUSE _ LAS VEGAS _ Christmas is closing in, and
``Dellbert,'' an imaginary teen-age inhabitant of Dell Computer
Inc.'s ``Holiday House,'' suspects that his parents forgot his
Christmas wish list. Better to put it on paper, he decides, using a
festive font and full color, with photos downloaded from the
Internet. He sends it from his bedroom personal computer to his
parents' printer and then e-mails it to his mother _ who can read
it in the kitchen on her notebook PC. It can't escape his mother's
attention, Dellbert figures, because she is always surfing the Web
wirelessly for new recipes. These were a few of the visions evoked
last week during a tour of Dell Computer Corp.'s Holiday House, set
up in a quiet red-brick townhome at the Las Vegas Country Club, a
mile or so from the din of Comdex. (Mahoney, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-FAILURE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Todd Rogers' story is one you
don't hear very often in a town like Austin. In 1996, he quit his
job and became a high-tech entrepreneur. But he didn't become a
member of one of Central Texas' growing league of overnight
high-tech millionaires. Rogers' company, which developed software
for veterinary clinics, failed. Today, nearly a year later, he's
still paying off debts. He drives a Honda Accord, not a Porsche. He
doesn't live in a mansion. And he's back working for somebody else.
(Hawkins, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TECH-GADGETS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ VTech Industries of Wheeling,
Ill., sells several e-mail products that it says can be used
anywhere by simply plugging them into a telephone jack. Two of the
products, e-Mail PostBox and e-Mail Express, sell for less than
$100. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>

festive font and full color, with photos downloaded from the

parents' printer and then e-mails it to his mother _ who can read
it in the kitchen on her notebook PC. It can't escape his mother's
attention, Dellbert figures, because she is always surfing the Web
wirelessly for new recipes. These were a few of the visions evoked
last week during a tour of Dell Computer Corp.'s Holiday House, set

  (Includes color graphic of a brain showing the four types of
stroke) 
 By BEN STEELMAN 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Pritchard doesn't remember much about what happened on
Jan. 19, but she'll never forget the date. The Carolina Beach,
N.C., resident suddenly became disoriented. She couldn't recognize
her husband, Herman, or her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband quickly dialed 911 for an ambulance. It was a wise
move. Pritchard was having a cerebral infarction, more commonly
called a stroke. Part of her brain was starving for oxygen and
rapidly dying.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 600,000 Americans experience a stroke each year, an
average of one every 53 seconds. About a fourth of these will die.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who survive, thousands will be left crippled, with
paralyzed limbs, dimmed eyes, slowed or slurred speech or an
inability to chew or swallow properly.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of treating strokes _ including nursing home care,
home health care and lost wages _ is estimated at more than $45
billion per year. Strokes, sometimes called ''brain attacks,'' are
the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, an array of new drugs can make it less likely that
patients will suffer severely or that their disabilities will be
long-lasting. Moreover, rehabilitation and treatment can offer many
patients the hope of a near-complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard has been relatively lucky. ''I still am not back 100
percent,'' she said. ''I had a hard time getting my speech back.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been taking outpatient therapy sessions, and her
pronunciation is clear. Yet she hesitates briefly before
pronouncing each syllable.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grandsons say they can't understand me,'' she said.
''Sometimes, I don't understand myself.''
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassing for Pritchard has been a rare side effect of a
stroke called ''alien hand syndrome.'' One of her hands
occasionally does things without her control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of takes off on its own,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, unexpectedly, the hand will sometimes grab
inappropriately at other people nearby. Pritchard knows another
patient with the same condition who was nearly strangled by her own
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, alien hand syndrome generally disappears within six
to 12 months after the stroke, according to medical journals.
</P>
<P>
   Other stroke damage, however, can last for the rest of a
patient's life. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; STARVED FOR OXYGEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A stroke occurs when parts of the brain are suddenly deprived of
oxygen. This happens when oxygen-rich red blood cells can no longer
reach these areas.
</P>
<P>
   A blood clot or some other particle of matter can block a key
artery or blood vessel that feeds the brain. Such blockages, known
as thrombosis or embolisms, account for 70-80 percent of strokes,
according to the American Heart Association. In some cases, surgery
might be needed to clear the blockage.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a temporary blockage can lead to what doctors call
a transient ischemic attack, which are often _ and inappropriately
_ called a ''mini-stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms almost never last more than a day and generally
disappear within a few minutes or hours. But that doesn't mean the
symptoms should be ignored. Patients who have had a transient
ischemic attack are about 10 times more likely to suffer a
full-blown stroke than other people of the same age and sex.
Moreover, roughly 10 percent of strokes are preceded by these
attacks, according to the American Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
   Once a patient reaches a hospital, physicians have many new
techniques to treat a stroke. One of the most exciting is called
tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), also called a ''clot-buster.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally used to treat heart attacks, TPA was found to
minimize or prevent damage in roughly 11 percent of stroke
patients.
</P>
<P>
   TPA must be used with care, however, as it could endanger a
patient's life if the stroke is caused by bleeding rather than a
clot. Emergency room teams must move fast, using CAT scans and
other diagnostic tools, to determine which is which. Unless TPA is
used within three hours after stroke symptoms appear, it could
increase the risk of fatal bleeding. The drug also can be dangerous
to patients who take blood-thinners or who recently had major
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Studies are being made on neuroprotective agents, drugs that
could stop the chemical chain-reactions that lead to brain damage
after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   At a medical conference in Nashville earlier this year, doctors
reported on promising studies of one drug, prourokinase, which
could help patients up to six hours after stroke symptoms appear.
Unlike TPA, which is given intravenously, prourokinase must be
released directly into the brain, by way of a catheter threaded
through an artery _ a hazardous procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising drug, now being tested, has been derived from
snake venom. At the University of Pittsburgh, researchers are
experimenting with transplants of laboratory-grown brain cells in
an effort to help patients regain speech or motor skills more
rapidly. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; HOPE OF REHABILITATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the damage cannot be repaired. Once the
oxygen is cut off to parts of the brain, brain cells and nerve
cells begin to die within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The death of brain cells may deprive a patient of certain
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke patients may recognize common objects, but may not be
able to recall their names. Or they may develop aphasia, where they
know the words, but cannot remember what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, with appropriate therapies, patients' outlooks need
not be bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ''In rehabilitation medicine, the focus is always on function,''
said Dr. John Liguori, medical director for Coastal Rehabilitation
Hospital in Wilmington, N.C. ''We cannot cure strokes, but we can
treat the disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   If patients' arms and legs are weakened on one side of their
bodies, for example, therapists teach them how to use their
''good'' side for such skills as dressing, brushing their teeth or
operating a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, a leg brace or walker can help patients get
around almost normally.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering stroke patients may need help eating and drinking and
may even need to change their diets. If the nerve cells controlling
the throat muscles are affected, patients can have trouble
swallowing; liquids might pour straight into the lungs, leading to
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Speech therapists try to restimulate patients' brains. For
example, using pictures of a horse, a table or a dollar bill, the
therapist would ask, simply, ''What is that?'' If patients can't
name the object, the therapist might prompt them: ''It starts with
'tuh-'...'' Or: ''It's what you eat supper on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The words are up there,'' says Sharon Roberts, a speech
pathologist at Coastal Rehabilitation Hospital. ''The problem is
regaining access to them.''
</P>
<P>
   She likened the effects of a stroke to a hurricane or a
landslide closing a highway. Patients must gradually discover a new
way to their old memories, either by finding an alternate route or
rebuilding the path.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients, like Pritchard, can make considerable progress
with just a few months of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But the decades-long Framingham, Mass., heart study found that
31 percent of stroke survivors needed help caring for themselves
and that 16 percent needed to be institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some doctors think rehabilitation medicine is boring and slow
and that it's kind of depressing,'' Liguori said. ''But to me,
there's nothing more exciting than helping people regain their
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as one-third to one-half of stroke survivors suffer
clinical depression in the first two years after a stroke, the
American Heart Association reports.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this depression may result from physical damage to the
brain; it seems to be especially common when the front of the
brain's left hemisphere is the damaged area.
</P>
<P>
   Depression also may result from frustration or sorrow at one's
condition, at the loss of abilities once taken for granted or the
inability to enjoy once-favorite hobbies or pursuits.

SHARING FAMILY HISTORY: A GOOD HOLIDAY PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURA TAXEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   When my son Simon's teacher asked the children to make family
trees, he came to us for help and my husband and I were shocked at
how little we knew about our own pasts. We called our parents and
asked them for names, dates of birth, countries of origin, and
anything else they could recall about their parents, grandparents,
and other relations.
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky; we had living relatives who could give us this
information _ information that we might have absorbed by osmosis in
times gone by. It was once common for family members of different
generations to spend time together talking.
</P>
<P>
   Now members of extended families don't necessarily live close to
one another. And even when together, listening to stories about
dead relatives is often less appealing than watching television and
videos, playing computer games, or chatting online.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to know who they are, children need to know where
they come from. For many of us, the holiday season is a time to
gather together with relatives, some of whom we may not see on any
other days of the year. And that makes the holidays an ideal time
to collect family memories and share family history with children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children have a natural curiosity about the past and a hunger
to know about their family's history,'' said Dr. Alan Entin, a
psychologist and family therapist in Richmond, Va. ''It gives them
a satisfying feeling of connectedness and continuity. They take
great pride and pleasure in that sense of belonging.''
</P>
<P>
   Going back just three generations relates each of us to at least
14 people. Go back six more generations, and we're connected to a
minimum of a thousand other people. This notion of being part of a
larger clan is especially important for today's children, many of
whom have little regular contact with grandparents and relatives
beyond their immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   In our world of rapid change, family upheaval, and geographic
mobility, children may feel isolated and separate. Stories,
pictures, and information about the family tree offsets those
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our children always think of parents and grandparents as
having always been old,'' said Entin. ''Through stories and
photographs, they see us in new ways, get to know us. Discovering
who they resemble in the family and things they have in common
builds essential relationships with those who came before. It can
provide the support of an extended family even if that family
doesn't actually exist in day-to-day life.''
</P>
<P>
   You may feel there's nothing interesting to share. But you don't
need pedigree charts, larger than life heroes, or Indiana Jones
adventures in order to have a personal past that will be meaningful
to your children.
</P>
<P>
   History is more than great events _ it's also ordinary people
leading regular lives filled with simple pleasures and small
calamities. What seems dull to adults can be compelling to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''These stories are entertaining because they come from a world
that has gone away forever,'' said John Bellamy, a genealogy
specialist. ''No matter how average you think your family is, you
have stories to share that children will love.''
</P>
<P>
   We all have ancestors who came from some place, and each of us
has lived a life rich in experiences. Sharing those experiences
teaches children essential life lessons and nurtures compassion,
empathy, and the idea that they too can survive adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stories about hard, sad times can give adults a way to talk
about things like illness, death, and failure without it being too
overwhelming for children,'' said Entin. ''It helps kids to know
that everybody, including parents and older siblings who seem so
infallible, goes through hard times and makes mistakes. The most
beloved stories are usually about things that went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories sometimes have a dark side, and can evoke painful
emotions. But it's important not to deny children the gift of a
link to their past by your silence. Their grandpa may have been the
meanest, most good-for-nothing, wife-beating alcoholic that ever
lived, but he was also your father and there's something of value
you can pass on about his life to your children, even if it's only
about what not to do. In the sharing, you may begin to get a better
understanding of him and the forces that shaped your life, find
peace with what has happened to you, and let a kind of healing
begin.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ''Keeping Family Stories Alive,'' Vera Rosenbluth
writes that learning about her family's history gave her a feeling
of ''being a somebody'' and a comforting sensation of permanence.
''The stories of my grandmother's life weren't especially unusual;
every family has similar stories. But for me, they were the most
special stories in the world because they were the stories of MY
family. They laminated me into my own and my family's past and were
an important part of my sense of identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Family history is documented in simple things like birth
announcements and old letters; in a piece of furniture or jewelry
that has been passed from one generation to another; in family
recipes and holiday traditions, in wedding dresses, medals, or
trophies stored away in boxes. Recalling where these objects came
from, when they were used, or to whom they first belonged can open
up a treasure chest of memories.
</P>
<P>
   There are stories hidden in names. The origin of your last name
can lead you into exploring your families geographic roots with
your kids. Nicknames and how they came about can evoke great
anecdotes, and if you, a relative, or your child is named after
someone else, there's a piece of the past in that too.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing your history can be as easy as saying, ''This is a song
my grandma always sang to me,'' or as elaborate as researching your
lineage. You can make a story out of all the different places
you've lived, or create a map that shows the travels and migrations
of your ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Let other family members help. People of another generation can
paint vivid, intimate pictures of the past for children with the
details of their daily lives _ what they wore, how food was
prepared, games they played, and how they earned a living. It's as
much history as what's in the social studies books. Children need
this kind of information so they can place people in real time.
Otherwise it's hard for them to know the difference between 1950
and 1850. This fact became obvious when one of my boys wanted to
know if my mother churned butter when I was a kid or if telephones
had been invented yet.
</P>
<P>
   Encourage children to ask questions and interview relatives at
family gatherings. ''It's a great way to bridge the generation gap,
to find out what parents and grandparents have been through,'' said
Ann Sindelar, a librarian for an Ohio Historical Society. ''It
personalizes the past, draws children and elders closer, helps kids
learn about events that have affected 'their' people, and see that
'their' people had an impact on events too.''
</P>
<P>
   It also teaches them to honor and respect elders and realize
they have something valuable to share.
</P>
<P>
   So start a new tradition this holiday season; make time to talk
with older relatives about the family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Be intentional about it. Ask where and when they were born, who
their parents were, and how they're related to you. Ask about their
lives, their work, they ways they enjoyed themselves. Write it
down. It will be an invaluable treasure for your children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giving children the history of their family lets them know
they're a product of the past,'' explained Bellamy. ''And like
those people, they have a stake in the future. I really believe
that if you don't understand where you came from, you won't know
where you're going.''

   INTERNET-SHOPPING (Undated) _ U.S. consumers are expected to
spend a record $9.5 billion by shopping on the Internet this
holiday season. Yet Consumer Reports concluded in a 13-page
``Holiday.shop'' special report that on-line shopping has a
downside. Sites can be vague when it comes to security and shipping
costs; inventory can be thin; navigating page after page of items
can be exhausting; and ordering procedures can be Byzantine. By
PAUL GRONDAHL.

   PILLOWS (Albany, N.Y.) _ A full day's activities requires a good
night's sleep. In addition to a good mattress, you should treat
yourself to a proper pillow. All pillows come with a comfort
lifetime (approximately five to 10 years for down or feather and
six months to two years for polyester pillows) before they lose
their fluffiness and need to be replaced. By FRANCES INGRAHAM

   AUDIO-BOOKS (Undated) _ A growing number of successful,
professional women are turning to writing in their spare time,
crafting thrillers out of their chosen careers. Patricia Cornwall,
the forensic pathologist, probably opened the door farther than
anyone else, but others are quickly following, crossing the
threshold. Here are three thrillers by women authors _ read with
flawless style by screen and stage veterans _ that demonstrate the
talent in the genre. By DOUG BLACKBURN.

<P>
   It is one of the most important predictors of financial and
social success. It helps determine where you work, where you live,
whether you wind up in jail. It can be measured with great
precision, and it changes very little over a lifetime. It is
substantially influenced by your genes. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is human intelligence, you don't have to go far
to find an argument. In the century since British psychologist
Charles Spearman proposed that a single, general mental ability
governs many aspects of cognitive performance, scientists and
society have bickered long and often about intelligence: what it
is, what it does, who has it, how to improve it, how to measure it,
and how to best interpret and use those measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the controversy incited by the 1994 book ``The
Bell Curve'' has revived the nature-nurture debate: Is intelligence
malleable or genetically programmed? Is a human mind born or made?
</P>
<P>
   After decades of research, most intelligence experts have come
to decide that it's both, in roughly equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   So it was perhaps inevitable that someone somewhere would
inaugurate the search for ``smart'' genes. That someone is Robert
Plomin, a 25-year veteran of intelligence research who is currently
stationed at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Plomin published the first evidence of a gene linked
to high IQ. This year, he reported the locations of three more
smart genes. And within the next several months, he expects to find
at least two dozen of the most important genetic determinants of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Already, his work has provoked visions _ and fears _ of DNA
doctors tinkering with the gears of cognition. ``I knew that nobody
else would be crazy enough to do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin's quest is one of the most audacious in the field of
behavioral genetics, a discipline dedicated to finding hereditary
factors that influence human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One type of study traces patterns of inheritance by comparing
identical twins reared together and apart. Another method compares
the traits of adopted children with those of their biological and
adoptive parents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Done well, these studies determine the heritability of a trait:
to what extent the differences among individuals are due to genes,
rather than to environmental forces such as upbringing, nutrition
and schooling. Once a heredity pattern for a trait is established,
researchers can home in on the genes responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But the search gets complicated when the genes in question are
for smarts. On one hand, intelligence as measured by IQ tests is a
reliable and stable component of human behavior. It doesn't change
much over a lifetime, and different tests tend to produce the same
results.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence is also the most highly inheritable mental
attribute known: Twin and adoption studies suggest that 30 to 70
percent of the differences among people's IQ scores can be
attributed to genes.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, including Plomin, think 50 percent is the most
likely figure. (Physical attributes such as height and weight can
be up to 90 percent heritable.)
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence is a complex phenomenon, governed by hundreds
or even thousands of genes. So patterns of inheritance aren't
obvious. Nor is the discovery of any one gene for intelligence
likely to be earthshaking, Plomin concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many genes are involved for any complex
trait in any plant or animal,'' he says. But any of the majority of
smart genes probably accounts for less than 1 percent of the
heritability of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists link genes to traits by using DNA markers: stretches
of DNA whose positions on chromosomes have been precisely plotted.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of each marker can vary, just as the gene for blue
eyes varies slightly from the gene for brown eyes. These different
versions of each marker, called alleles, correspond to different
versions of nearby genes.
</P>
<P>
   If people with a particular allele of a DNA marker possess a
trait and people without the allele don't, then a gene for that
trait is likely close to, or even the same as, the marker.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, Plomin compared two groups of children: 51
with an average IQ of 103, and 51 with an average IQ Of 136. He
used 37 markers on chromosome 6, which was chosen because it has
already been implicated in reading disabilities. His tests revealed
differences in one site located in a gene for a hormone receptor
that may be active in learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin thinks variations in this gene or another nearby could
account for 1 to 2 percent of the variance in IQ scores.
</P>
<P>
   To detect even smaller genetic contributions across the entire
human genome, Plomin would need a lot more people and a thousand
times as many DNA markers.
</P>
<P>
   Such large-scale studies seemed impractical until Plomin's
colleague Michael Owen suggested scrapping the laborious genetic
profiling of individual subjects. Owen proposed pooling subjects'
DNA instead and combing the pooled DNA from each study group just
once with the markers.
</P>
<P>
   Although DNA pooling can't determine with precision the
frequency of alleles in a study population, Plomin says, it can
point to differences between the normal- and high-IQ groups.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin has already used DNA pooling to identify three more sites
linked with high IQ, this time on chromosome 4. By year's end, he
and his colleagues will have screened hundreds of volunteers with
3,000 markers. Based on his results so far, he expects to find 20
to 30 more genes.
</P>
<P>
   And then what? It's almost inevitable, he says, that the genes
for intelligence will be used to determine people's genetic IQ. But
such tests wouldn't turn up much new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``By measuring the parents' IQ, we can already predict a kid's
IQ tremendously better than we will ever be able to predict it with
a DNA test,'' Plomin explains. ``And if schools were going to
select kids on the basis of ability, they'd still do better by
administering IQ tests. I think the implications for science are
much greater than the social implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific implications could include a better understanding
of the neural pathways involved in global reasoning, learning and
memory. Identifying and tracing the products of smart genes could
help researchers understand the origins of these abilities, with
potentially far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   No method for genetically boosting IQ currently exists, of
course, but strides in gene therapy might someday make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   If his latest project goes as planned, Plomin's years of quiet
gene hunting may soon provoke another unquiet round in the
intelligence debate.

potentially far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   No method for genetically boosting IQ currently exists, of
course, but strides in gene therapy might someday make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   If his latest project goes as planned, Plomin's years of quiet
gene hunting may soon provoke another unquiet round in the
intelligence debate.

   ``'old 'em I had a toofake. 'Ree days ahgo. Wisdom toof.''
</P>
<P>
   Our new patient's bulk almost obscured the stretcher he lay on.
His guards had brought him over from the prison.
</P>
<P>
   David, my resident, cautiously approached. Mr. Bryce had good
reason to be upset; the left side of his face jutted out like a
tennis ball. When he tried to speak, his tongue sounded stuck to
the back of his throat.
</P>
<P>
   David probed him gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ow! 'Oc, c'mon I need sumpn' for pain!'' Bryce protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold still just a second, sir,'' David soothed. ``I need to
get a sense of how far this extends.''
</P>
<P>
   David carefully fingered the swollen cheek. When he completed
the exam, he showed me the note Bryce's guards had brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Started him on penicillin only yesterday. Left lower wisdom
tooth infection, possibly early abscess. Nothing early about it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge,'' I agreed. ``How far over?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the midline of the floor of the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce was suffering, in part, because of the limits of a funny
little bone called the hyoid. It's the small hard ridge you feel
just above your Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   The hyoid's job is to hold muscle attachments from the tongue,
trachea and throat in place. And it does that job well.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one design flaw. The hyoid bone isn't wide enough to
receive muscle attachments from the rear of the jaw, where the last
two molar teeth sit.
</P>
<P>
   While the muscles on the floor of the mouth can act as a fire
wall to keep infections from spreading back into the throat, there
is only a weak physical barrier to infections if they crop up in
the second molar or the third, the wisdom tooth. And bacterial
infections are a constant threat at the warm, nutrient-filled
border between gums and teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Once a pocket of pus breaks through the thin bone surrounding
the tooth sockets, it can run amok into the throat and even down
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   To get some sense of how inflamed and infected his jaw muscles
were, we asked Bryce to say ``ah.'' His throat was so narrowed by
the swelling that David could barely fit two fingers between the
top and bottom incisors.
</P>
<P>
   I stepped up to Bryce and said, ``Don't bite me, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   His tongue, lifted from below by the infection, was starting to
bulge out of his mouth. I needed to feel around the base of his
molars for an abscess to lance. I got half a gloved finger in
before he jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ow!''
</P>
<P>
   My finger jerked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, doctor _ uhmfing for 'ain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming. We're almost finished.''
</P>
<P>
   I retraced David's path along the swollen cheek. Sometimes tooth
abscesses develop in clearly localized and accessible regions,
making incision and drainage relatively easy tasks. But not
Bryce's. The swelling, hard as a rock, stretched from the corner of
his jaw to the upper part of his neck: No targets around there.
</P>
<P>
   The throat swelling and the hardness in the floor of the mouth
were signs of extensive infected tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ludwig's?'' David asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's angina _ an infection in the floor of the mouth and
neck that can move quickly, causing massive throat swelling and
strangulation _ can kill patients within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking through the thin bone of the wisdom tooth socket,
Bryce's infection had surged in two directions. It had raced up his
jaw and curved beneath the floor of his mouth. And it had moved
back, pushing the tongue up against the palate, forward out of the
mouth and, most dangerously, back into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   As the infection moves backward, it shoves the tongue awfully
close to the epiglottis. This delicate structure projects above the
windpipe, snapping shut when food or drink tumbles down our
gullets. The tongue, if pushed back far enough, can sit on the
epiglottis, causing immediate suffocation. And in the most severe
cases, the rear of the mouth swells so much that the windpipe
itself is squeezed shut.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, the only remedy is to cut a hole in the
windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you suggest?'' I asked David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antibiotics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mordy,'' I added.
</P>
<P>
   Mordy Hoschander is an oral surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like a Ludwig's,'' I told Mordy over the phone. ``We
started him on Unasyn and clindamycin, and we're firing up the CAT
scan.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two potent antibiotics would clobber the bacteria and halt
their spread to virgin territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good,'' Mordy answered. ``I'm on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably need surgery,'' I told Bryce. ``We'll get a
CAT scan right away to see if you have an abscess in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery residents came to take Bryce up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swelling's bigger than it was three hours ago,'' David
told them. ``This guy's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening Mordy told me how things had gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit the operating room, the swelling had marched clear
across his jaw. The tongue bulged out like a toad's. Then we tried
to get a look from the outside. We incised the softest spot in the
cheek, probed down to the bone, then curled around the inside of
the mandible. No pus.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Mordy said, he stitched a soft rubber drain into
the wound and started probing the mouth. There was a suspicious
bulging at the back, below and behind the tonsil.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryce's airway protected by the plastic endotracheal tube,
Mordy could roam at will. When he stuck in a needle, out came two
teaspoons of pus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went after it with a blade,'' he added, ``and massive
amounts of pus came out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryce still had a long way to go. The next day, his face and
neck seemed to have swollen to twice the size. For the next 48
hours he could barely open his mouth. And he kept spiking fevers,
even though his white blood cell count _ a crude measure of
infection _ had started inching down.
</P>
<P>
   Worried, Mordy did another CAT scan to see if a new abscess had
formed. Negative. He called the infectious-disease consult for
ideas on better antibiotic cocktails. But he agreed with our
initial choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third morning, a smiling, hungry Bryce greeted his
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boom,'' Mordy said. ``Fever, white count, swelling _ all came
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultures?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strep and anaerobic bacteria. We yanked the tube. An hour
later he's having breakfast. We held the line at clear liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tongue is tough,'' Mordy marveled. ``Great blood supply.
Once you clean up the neighborhood, it's right back in business.''

 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is one of the most important predictors of financial and
social success. It helps determine where you work, where you live,
whether you wind up in jail. It can be measured with great
precision, and it changes very little over a lifetime. It is
substantially influenced by your genes. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is human intelligence, you don't have to go far
to find an argument. In the century since British psychologist
Charles Spearman proposed that a single, general mental ability
governs many aspects of cognitive performance, scientists and
society have bickered long and often about intelligence: what it
is, what it does, who has it, how to improve it, how to measure it,
and how to best interpret and use those measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the controversy incited by the 1994 book ``The
Bell Curve'' has revived the nature-nurture debate: Is intelligence
malleable or genetically programmed? Is a human mind born or made?
</P>
<P>
   After decades of research, most intelligence experts have come
to decide that it's both, in roughly equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   So it was perhaps inevitable that someone somewhere would
inaugurate the search for ``smart'' genes. That someone is Robert
Plomin, a 25-year veteran of intelligence research who is currently
stationed at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Plomin published the first evidence of a gene linked
to high IQ. This year, he reported the locations of three more
smart genes. And within the next several months, he expects to find
at least two dozen of the most important genetic determinants of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Already, his work has provoked visions _ and fears _ of DNA
doctors tinkering with the gears of cognition. ``I knew that nobody
else would be crazy enough to do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin's quest is one of the most audacious in the field of
behavioral genetics, a discipline dedicated to finding hereditary
factors that influence human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One type of study traces patterns of inheritance by comparing
identical twins reared together and apart. Another method compares
the traits of adopted children with those of their biological and
adoptive parents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Done well, these studies determine the heritability of a trait:
to what extent the differences among individuals are due to genes,
rather than to environmental forces such as upbringing, nutrition
and schooling. Once a heredity pattern for a trait is established,
researchers can home in on the genes responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But the search gets complicated when the genes in question are
for smarts. On one hand, intelligence as measured by IQ tests is a
reliable and stable component of human behavior. It doesn't change
much over a lifetime, and different tests tend to produce the same
results.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence is also the most highly inheritable mental
attribute known: Twin and adoption studies suggest that 30 to 70
percent of the differences among people's IQ scores can be
attributed to genes.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, including Plomin, think 50 percent is the most
likely figure. (Physical attributes such as height and weight can
be up to 90 percent heritable.)
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence is a complex phenomenon, governed by hundreds
or even thousands of genes. So patterns of inheritance aren't
obvious. Nor is the discovery of any one gene for intelligence
likely to be earthshaking, Plomin concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many genes are involved for any complex
trait in any plant or animal,'' he says. But any of the majority of
smart genes probably accounts for less than 1 percent of the
heritability of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists link genes to traits by using DNA markers: stretches
of DNA whose positions on chromosomes have been precisely plotted.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of each marker can vary, just as the gene for blue
eyes varies slightly from the gene for brown eyes. These different
versions of each marker, called alleles, correspond to different
versions of nearby genes.
</P>
<P>
   If people with a particular allele of a DNA marker possess a
trait and people without the allele don't, then a gene for that
trait is likely close to, or even the same as, the marker.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, Plomin compared two groups of children: 51
with an average IQ of 103, and 51 with an average IQ Of 136. He
used 37 markers on chromosome 6, which was chosen because it has
already been implicated in reading disabilities. His tests revealed
differences in one site located in a gene for a hormone receptor
that may be active in learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin thinks variations in this gene or another nearby could
account for 1 to 2 percent of the variance in IQ scores.
</P>
<P>
   To detect even smaller genetic contributions across the entire
human genome, Plomin would need a lot more people and a thousand
times as many DNA markers.
</P>
<P>
   Such large-scale studies seemed impractical until Plomin's
colleague Michael Owen suggested scrapping the laborious genetic
profiling of individual subjects. Owen proposed pooling subjects'
DNA instead and combing the pooled DNA from each study group just
once with the markers.
</P>
<P>
   Although DNA pooling can't determine with precision the
frequency of alleles in a study population, Plomin says, it can
point to differences between the normal- and high-IQ groups.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin has already used DNA pooling to identify three more sites
linked with high IQ, this time on chromosome 4. By year's end, he
and his colleagues will have screened hundreds of volunteers with
3,000 markers. Based on his results so far, he expects to find 20
to 30 more genes.
</P>
<P>
   And then what? It's almost inevitable, he says, that the genes
for intelligence will be used to determine people's genetic IQ. But
such tests wouldn't turn up much new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``By measuring the parents' IQ, we can already predict a kid's
IQ tremendously better than we will ever be able to predict it with
a DNA test,'' Plomin explains. ``And if schools were going to
select kids on the basis of ability, they'd still do better by
administering IQ tests. I think the implications for science are
much greater than the social implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific implications could include a better understanding
of the neural pathways involved in global reasoning, learning and
memory. Identifying and tracing the products of smart genes could
help researchers understand the origins of these abilities, with
potentially far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   No method for genetically boosting IQ currently exists, of
course, but strides in gene therapy might someday make it possible.

<P>
   It is one of the most important predictors of financial and
social success. It helps determine where you work, where you live,
whether you wind up in jail. It can be measured with great
precision, and it changes very little over a lifetime. It is
substantially influenced by your genes. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is human intelligence, you don't have to go far
to find an argument. In the century since British psychologist
Charles Spearman proposed that a single, general mental ability
governs many aspects of cognitive performance, scientists and
society have bickered long and often about intelligence: what it
is, what it does, who has it, how to improve it, how to measure it,
and how to best interpret and use those measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the controversy incited by the 1994 book ``The
Bell Curve'' has revived the nature-nurture debate: Is intelligence
malleable or genetically programmed? Is a human mind born or made?
</P>
<P>
   After decades of research, most intelligence experts have come
to decide that it's both, in roughly equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   So it was perhaps inevitable that someone somewhere would
inaugurate the search for ``smart'' genes. That someone is Robert
Plomin, a 25-year veteran of intelligence research who is currently
stationed at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Plomin published the first evidence of a gene linked
to high IQ. This year, he reported the locations of three more
smart genes. And within the next several months, he expects to find
at least two dozen of the most important genetic determinants of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Already, his work has provoked visions _ and fears _ of DNA
doctors tinkering with the gears of cognition. ``I knew that nobody
else would be crazy enough to do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin's quest is one of the most audacious in the field of
behavioral genetics, a discipline dedicated to finding hereditary
factors that influence human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One type of study traces patterns of inheritance by comparing
identical twins reared together and apart. Another method compares
the traits of adopted children with those of their biological and
adoptive parents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Done well, these studies determine the heritability of a trait:
to what extent the differences among individuals are due to genes,
rather than to environmental forces such as upbringing, nutrition
and schooling. Once a heredity pattern for a trait is established,
researchers can home in on the genes responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But the search gets complicated when the genes in question are
for smarts. On one hand, intelligence as measured by IQ tests is a
reliable and stable component of human behavior. It doesn't change
much over a lifetime, and different tests tend to produce the same
results.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence is also the most highly inheritable mental
attribute known: Twin and adoption studies suggest that 30 to 70
percent of the differences among people's IQ scores can be
attributed to genes.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, including Plomin, think 50 percent is the most
likely figure. (Physical attributes such as height and weight can
be up to 90 percent heritable.)
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence is a complex phenomenon, governed by hundreds
or even thousands of genes. So patterns of inheritance aren't
obvious. Nor is the discovery of any one gene for intelligence
likely to be earthshaking, Plomin concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many genes are involved for any complex
trait in any plant or animal,'' he says. But any of the majority of
smart genes probably accounts for less than 1 percent of the
heritability of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists link genes to traits by using DNA markers: stretches
of DNA whose positions on chromosomes have been precisely plotted.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of each marker can vary, just as the gene for blue
eyes varies slightly from the gene for brown eyes. These different
versions of each marker, called alleles, correspond to different
versions of nearby genes.
</P>
<P>
   If people with a particular allele of a DNA marker possess a
trait and people without the allele don't, then a gene for that
trait is likely close to, or even the same as, the marker.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, Plomin compared two groups of children: 51
with an average IQ of 103, and 51 with an average IQ Of 136. He
used 37 markers on chromosome 6, which was chosen because it has
already been implicated in reading disabilities. His tests revealed
differences in one site located in a gene for a hormone receptor
that may be active in learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin thinks variations in this gene or another nearby could
account for 1 to 2 percent of the variance in IQ scores.
</P>
<P>
   To detect even smaller genetic contributions across the entire
human genome, Plomin would need a lot more people and a thousand
times as many DNA markers.
</P>
<P>
   Such large-scale studies seemed impractical until Plomin's
colleague Michael Owen suggested scrapping the laborious genetic
profiling of individual subjects. Owen proposed pooling subjects'
DNA instead and combing the pooled DNA from each study group just
once with the markers.
</P>
<P>
   Although DNA pooling can't determine with precision the
frequency of alleles in a study population, Plomin says, it can
point to differences between the normal- and high-IQ groups.
</P>
<P>
   Plomin has already used DNA pooling to identify three more sites
linked with high IQ, this time on chromosome 4. By year's end, he
and his colleagues will have screened hundreds of volunteers with
3,000 markers. Based on his results so far, he expects to find 20
to 30 more genes.
</P>
<P>
   And then what? It's almost inevitable, he says, that the genes
for intelligence will be used to determine people's genetic IQ. But
such tests wouldn't turn up much new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``By measuring the parents' IQ, we can already predict a kid's
IQ tremendously better than we will ever be able to predict it with
a DNA test,'' Plomin explains. ``And if schools were going to
select kids on the basis of ability, they'd still do better by
administering IQ tests. I think the implications for science are
much greater than the social implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific implications could include a better understanding
of the neural pathways involved in global reasoning, learning and
memory. Identifying and tracing the products of smart genes could
help researchers understand the origins of these abilities, with
potentially far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   No method for genetically boosting IQ currently exists, of
course, but strides in gene therapy might someday make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   If his latest project goes as planned, Plomin's years of quiet
gene hunting may soon provoke another unquiet round in the
intelligence debate.

<P>
   ``'old 'em I had a toofake. 'Ree days ahgo. Wisdom toof.''
</P>
<P>
   Our new patient's bulk almost obscured the stretcher he lay on.
His guards had brought him over from the prison.
</P>
<P>
   David, my resident, cautiously approached. Mr. Bryce had good
reason to be upset; the left side of his face jutted out like a
tennis ball. When he tried to speak, his tongue sounded stuck to
the back of his throat.
</P>
<P>
   David probed him gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ow! 'Oc, c'mon I need sumpn' for pain!'' Bryce protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold still just a second, sir,'' David soothed. ``I need to
get a sense of how far this extends.''
</P>
<P>
   David carefully fingered the swollen cheek. When he completed
the exam, he showed me the note Bryce's guards had brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Started him on penicillin only yesterday. Left lower wisdom
tooth infection, possibly early abscess. Nothing early about it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge,'' I agreed. ``How far over?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the midline of the floor of the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce was suffering, in part, because of the limits of a funny
little bone called the hyoid. It's the small hard ridge you feel
just above your Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   The hyoid's job is to hold muscle attachments from the tongue,
trachea and throat in place. And it does that job well.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one design flaw. The hyoid bone isn't wide enough to
receive muscle attachments from the rear of the jaw, where the last
two molar teeth sit.
</P>
<P>
   While the muscles on the floor of the mouth can act as a fire
wall to keep infections from spreading back into the throat, there
is only a weak physical barrier to infections if they crop up in
the second molar or the third, the wisdom tooth. And bacterial
infections are a constant threat at the warm, nutrient-filled
border between gums and teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Once a pocket of pus breaks through the thin bone surrounding
the tooth sockets, it can run amok into the throat and even down
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   To get some sense of how inflamed and infected his jaw muscles
were, we asked Bryce to say ``ah.'' His throat was so narrowed by
the swelling that David could barely fit two fingers between the
top and bottom incisors.
</P>
<P>
   I stepped up to Bryce and said, ``Don't bite me, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   His tongue, lifted from below by the infection, was starting to
bulge out of his mouth. I needed to feel around the base of his
molars for an abscess to lance. I got half a gloved finger in
before he jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ow!''
</P>
<P>
   My finger jerked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, doctor _ uhmfing for 'ain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming. We're almost finished.''
</P>
<P>
   I retraced David's path along the swollen cheek. Sometimes tooth
abscesses develop in clearly localized and accessible regions,
making incision and drainage relatively easy tasks. But not
Bryce's. The swelling, hard as a rock, stretched from the corner of
his jaw to the upper part of his neck: No targets around there.
</P>
<P>
   The throat swelling and the hardness in the floor of the mouth
were signs of extensive infected tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ludwig's?'' David asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's angina _ an infection in the floor of the mouth and
neck that can move quickly, causing massive throat swelling and
strangulation _ can kill patients within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking through the thin bone of the wisdom tooth socket,
Bryce's infection had surged in two directions. It had raced up his
jaw and curved beneath the floor of his mouth. And it had moved
back, pushing the tongue up against the palate, forward out of the
mouth and, most dangerously, back into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   As the infection moves backward, it shoves the tongue awfully
close to the epiglottis. This delicate structure projects above the
windpipe, snapping shut when food or drink tumbles down our
gullets. The tongue, if pushed back far enough, can sit on the
epiglottis, causing immediate suffocation. And in the most severe
cases, the rear of the mouth swells so much that the windpipe
itself is squeezed shut.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, the only remedy is to cut a hole in the
windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you suggest?'' I asked David.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antibiotics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mordy,'' I added.
</P>
<P>
   Mordy Hoschander is an oral surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like a Ludwig's,'' I told Mordy over the phone. ``We
started him on Unasyn and clindamycin, and we're firing up the CAT
scan.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two potent antibiotics would clobber the bacteria and halt
their spread to virgin territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds good,'' Mordy answered. ``I'm on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably need surgery,'' I told Bryce. ``We'll get a
CAT scan right away to see if you have an abscess in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery residents came to take Bryce up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swelling's bigger than it was three hours ago,'' David
told them. ``This guy's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening Mordy told me how things had gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit the operating room, the swelling had marched clear
across his jaw. The tongue bulged out like a toad's. Then we tried
to get a look from the outside. We incised the softest spot in the
cheek, probed down to the bone, then curled around the inside of
the mandible. No pus.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Mordy said, he stitched a soft rubber drain into
the wound and started probing the mouth. There was a suspicious
bulging at the back, below and behind the tonsil.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryce's airway protected by the plastic endotracheal tube,
Mordy could roam at will. When he stuck in a needle, out came two
teaspoons of pus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went after it with a blade,'' he added, ``and massive
amounts of pus came out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryce still had a long way to go. The next day, his face and
neck seemed to have swollen to twice the size. For the next 48
hours he could barely open his mouth. And he kept spiking fevers,
even though his white blood cell count _ a crude measure of
infection _ had started inching down.
</P>
<P>
   Worried, Mordy did another CAT scan to see if a new abscess had
formed. Negative. He called the infectious-disease consult for
ideas on better antibiotic cocktails. But he agreed with our
initial choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wait,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third morning, a smiling, hungry Bryce greeted his
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boom,'' Mordy said. ``Fever, white count, swelling _ all came
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cultures?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strep and anaerobic bacteria. We yanked the tube. An hour
later he's having breakfast. We held the line at clear liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tongue is tough,'' Mordy marveled. ``Great blood supply.
Once you clean up the neighborhood, it's right back in business.''

   NEW YORK _ ``There's nothing else like it in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   There is probably no sentence more frequently uttered along
Seventh Avenue, one used liberally by eager salesmen seeking to
describe a garment, a fabric or design as truly distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a sentence less likely to be true in an industry
dominated by a culture of copycats.
</P>
<P>
   Knockoffs, it is said, have been part of fashion ever since Eve
saw Adam's fig leaf and designed one of her own. They have a
storied history, from the legitimized couture copies sold by some
of the leading U.S. department stores in the '50s and '60s right up
to today's phenomenon of dress adaptations made by ABS and Victor
Costa that mimic clothes worn during the Academy Award
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a practice so commonplace, and one not clearly prohibited
by law, that most designers who have been copied have felt helpless
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been several recent legal challenges, and now
that the Supreme Court has taken up a case with the potential to
define what constitutes a violation of existing trade dress law,
the practice of knockoffs is under the spotlight, raising questions
among manufacturers of what the ramifications of such a decision
could be.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court got into the design business in October when
it took up an appeal by Wal-Mart Inc., which lost a $1.25 million
judgment to a children's playsuit maker in 1996. In the case, to be
decided sometime next year, the justices will define what makes a
product's look or image so distinctive it can't be legally copied.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have made their names by aping others' designs,
it's a tricky issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there has been a garment business, people have
always been inspired by others,'' said Allen B. Schwartz, design
director of ABS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about who puts what spin on it,'' he said. ``Gaultier
or Galliano will put their spin on it, I'll put my spin on it, but
fashion isn't anything unless everyone is buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz is the self-anointed King of Copycats and promotes the
practice proudly _ he says he can turn out a designer adaptation
nearly overnight and have it in stores within a few weeks. He's
appeared on numerous television programs displaying this talent,
and even paid his own airfare to Chicago this year to show his
Academy Awards-inspired collection on ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `original' does not exist in fashion,'' Schwartz
said. ``Everything starts from some sort of inspiration. If Calvin
or Ralph or Burberry think they invented plaid, a slip dress or a
bias cut, they need to get to a couch. They are just reinventing it
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers like Schwartz and Victor Costa, who also claims to be
the fastest at getting Oscar looks into stores, argue that they are
performing a service to customers who want, but can't afford, to
look like celebrities in custom-made designer gowns. The designers
they imitate, however, rarely appreciate the flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Miuccia Prada, in a 1996 profile, decried the mass adaptations
of her designs, calling the knockoff artists ``vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing an incredible attack from people who want
to know what we are doing,'' she said. ``They hang around our
fabric mills, they want to see our prototypes _ it's really
becoming unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so aggravating,'' said Vera Wang. ``If I were Miuccia
Prada, I'd take a gun and shoot everyone in the shoe industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang has seen her bridal designs knocked off throughout the
industry, and looks she created for celebrities at the Academy
Awards copied within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that most consumers know the difference, so
therein lies the problem,'' she said. ``Most of the real design
houses end up becoming design studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang said since his firm has been frequently quoted as
one of the most influential fashion houses of the '90s, ``for this
award we take obviously the good and the bad which goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta called it the ``highest form of flattery,''
but added, ``What would really upset me is if no one copied me.
Today you deal with a consumer who is highly sophisticated. She
knows that what I'm selling not only has a certain look, it also
has a certain quality of manufacturing. That cannot be knocked
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nova USA designer Tony Melillo said, ``At first, you feel like
somebody is making money off what you did, but in the end, you feel
at least you're doing something right. It came up recently with the
Gap photographing everything with judo pants, which I've been doing
since I started. In the end, I actually feel a little bit weird
about it, but it's life.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, Jean-Jacques Picart _ Christian Lacroix's former
partner _ said, ``In the old days, there was copying; now people
are hijacking the very identity of designers. It's turned into a
real handicap for us. Copies are like mosquitoes. One bite doesn't
matter _ just an irritation _ but 100 bites give you a fever that
can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was made in reaction to Yves Saint Laurent's
successful lawsuit against Ralph Lauren, in which YSL charged in
Paris courts that his couture tuxedo dress had been knocked off by
Lauren. He demanded damages of close to $1 million at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren counterattacked, and demanded $174,000 in damages for
defamation of character for statements in Women's Wear Daily by YSL
president Pierre Berge, who accused the American of ripping off
YSL.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauren and YSL dresses were modeled in court before Judge
Madelaine Cotelle, who pointed out the differences in fabric, how
YSL's version had pockets and how one had gold buttons and the
other did not. Lauren was found guilty and both were fined _
Lauren, $393,000 for copying the dress; Berge, $89,295 for
``denigration'' of Lauren's character.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch also lost a high-profile case against
American Eagle Outfitters in which it said American Eagle had
unfairly copied the look and the printed wording on some of its
garments. That suit was dismissed in July in U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati, although A&AMP;F has vowed further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Whether apparel firms can do anything about it, though,has
garment industry executives talking about the potential
ramifications of the case before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   While many demand stronger legal protection from piracy, they
also fear a storm of litigation would arise if the High Court
upholds the case, opening the way for suits against anything
perceived as a knockoff, even something as basic as a cargo pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really help the industry if they could get something
like this (a specific law) done, because you would end up with more
diversity of product,'' Konheim said. ``But the thing is, if you do
a cargo pant and somebody else does a cargo pant, is that
copying?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller copyrights each of the prints she designs, and the
firm has successfully filed more than 1,500 infringement cases
since 1986 related to firms that copy the designs. While prints are
clearly protected under law, silhouettes are a tricky issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a copy,'' Konheim said. ``That's a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Azria, president of BCBG, who has frequently been accused of
copying top designer lines, blasted the practice of knocking off
other designers, and said his line is as subject to knockoffs as
anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from the mass market copy you and can put you out of
business,'' he said. ``I spend $10 million to $20 million in
product development a year, only to be knocked off by a contractor.
The question is not what is right or wrong, the question is why
America does not have any law that would protect us from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Schwartz added that all designers look to others for
inspiration. ``I eat, live and breathe fashion. I watch CNN every
morning. I read every magazine,'' he said. ``Nobody has a lock on
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz stressed that even though he has a reputation as a
copycat, he's really a kitten. His Academy Award group accounts for
about 5 percent of his business, ``and 5,000 percent of my
publicity,'' but the rest of the ABS line is made up of
``original'' interpretations of what is happening in fashion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Where a designer could really get into trouble, he said, is by
copying a print, since that is protected by law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the version of the John Galliano gown that Cate Blanchett
wore to the Academy Awards in March seemed a little daring,
considering it was copied right down to the fluttering hummingbird
embroidered on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Schwartz said. ``Mine was a seagull.''

 c.1999 Fairchild Publications   
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The great Internet land grab continues.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce pioneers, some with huge advertising budgets, are out
to generate sales, surely, but they're also looking to build brand
loyalty, capture ``mindshare'' and squash the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has in effect become advertising's newest category.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Web sites and Internet services is invading
every media vehicle, from prime time TV to local newspapers, as
well as a host of creative new venues, from store kiosks to
18-wheelers. And it's growing more pervasive every day.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet fashion frontier, where a dominant player such
as Amazon.com has yet to emerge, competition is intense. The
medium's exponential sales growth and potential are adding fuel to
the flame, making advertising more crucial than ever, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   New online business is indeed up for grabs in fashion and
related categories. Total Internet retail sales are projected at
$14.9 billion for 1999 and $23.1 billion for 2000, up from $7.8
billion in 1998. Fashion, footwear, health and personal care areas
should generate around $1 billion in 1999, and $1.9 billion for
2000, according to Jupiter Communications, a New York consulting
firm that tracks the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With an infusion of new investment money from recent IPOs and
venture capital, young online companies are stepping up to the
plate with multi-million-dollar advertising budgets that in some
cases rival total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly.com, a designer outlet with 200 brands at discount
prices, had a second-quarter 1999 marketing budget of $2.48
million, compared with sales of $1.14 million for the same period.
And with a $10 million capital infusion from financier George
Soros, the company is expected to spend heavily over the next three
years to build business, with advertising an important priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to gain share of mind, to dominate, and it's something
we intend to do with a big commitment over the next few years, not
over the next few generations,'' said Ken Seiff, chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly.com's campaign _ a stylized woman in a lounge chair with
a martini and Chinese takeout food _ includes the copy ``Tuesday,
11:15 p.m. _ buying a new dress.'' Rather than touting discount
prices, the message stresses the benefits and convenience of
Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Camdens, a Web site focusing on upscale corporate
gifts, uses advertising to promote a message of luxury,
personalization and customization, one that sharply contrasts with
much of today's offbeat Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the avalanche of dot-com advertising, many companies use
shock value, such as shooting gerbils out of a cannon, to get
attention,'' said Fred Reffsin, ceo of Camdens. ``We're trying to
emphasize services, image and what the Internet can do for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reffsin said the money and time it takes to acquire new
customers is justified by the enormous potential of the gift
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, we can be a first mover, so we have to get out a
strong, compelling message,'' he said. ``It takes money and time to
convince people to change shopping behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' annual advertising budget of over $20 million includes
a combination of broadcast and print media to build its brand
image.
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' target customer represents a ``new luxury buyer,''
Reffsin said. The new luxury customer, who may come from
middle-class origins, buys for personal rewards, rather than
status, he continued. ``Unique product, such as a teak mousepad and
matching monitor, stands for individualized expression for the
sender as well as the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the name out, in any way possible, is the first step in
brand building, a challenge that can be especially daunting and
expensive to new, relatively unknown companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora.com, which launched a beauty Web site this month, has a
leg up by having established stores first, said Jim Kenney, ceo.
With 33 U.S. stores, and 50 scheduled by yearend, the two channels
are designed to complement each other. Customers can reorder store
items online and return online items at stores.
</P>
<P>
   A $25 million ad campaign features a strong fourth-quarter push
that integrates the store and web site messages, which both stress
ease of shopping and elegant presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond traditional offline media, online advertising is evolving
from simple banners to partnerships, such as portal agreements.
That alone can cost millions. Online advertising, which totaled
$2.8 billion in 1999, allows focused, targeted messages that reach
potential shoppers and result in sales conversions, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, such as Fashionmall.com, seek a smart strategy
through a combination of offline and online advertising that pays
off in measurable costs and sales results.
</P>
<P>
   In business since 1994, Fashionmall.com is ancient compared with
many Internet players. The company's ad budget grew from $500,000
last year to $8 million this year, following an IPO and a total
redesign of the site last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to just throw money at advertising; you have
spend money smartly,'' said Ben Narasin, ceo. ``We've learned
through mistakes over the past few years what works best.''
</P>
<P>
   Offline spending includes traditional print and television, as
well as telephone kiosks, a Times Square wall, the ``7th on Sixth''
fashion show and even sandwich boards. A ``tease and reveal''
campaign featured a man and woman staring at a black dot with no
copy, with the company name and logo added later.
</P>
<P>
   The company's online investment went beyond banner advertising,
which has proven ineffective, to partnerships that really generate
traffic and acquire customers, said Narasin.
</P>
<P>
   Online partnerships are key for Ashford.com, a luxury goods
retail website launched in April 1998. With sales of $30 million
for fiscal 1999, the company's annual advertising budget is $17
million, with $10 million for fourth quarter alone, in anticipation
of big holiday demand.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 percent budgeted for online advertising, Ashford.com has
established multi-million dollar partnerships with AOL and Yahoo to
drive traffic to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is cost of customer acquisition,'' said
Kenny Kurtzman, ceo. ``Online advertising is efficient and highly
measurable in cost terms, while offline advertising is harder to
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   For offline spending, Ashford.com will use TV, radio and print.
For holiday, magazines include both fashion, food and financial
publications, such as Bon Appetit, Harpers, Fortune, Vanity Fair,
Vogue and Money.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty and fragrance sites, such as Jasmin.com, launched in
August, are finding direct mail and sampling to be as effective as
traditional media in promoting product. With an $8 million
marketing budget, Jasmin.com will promote its exclusive
distribution of the Hugo Boss fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmin.com's all-offline strategy includes over 30 million
on-page samples with fragrance on a gauze strip and a Jasmin.com ad
on the flip side. The Jasmin.com ad _ a woman surrounded by a green
veil _ conveys a sensual, emotional message meant to resonate with
fragrance buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the Internet clutter, the crazy spending, and many of
the dot com companies not being marketing experts, brand building
can still be hard,'' said Dale Dewey, president and ceo. ``But even
with the Internet, the normal ad rules still apply, and a good,
creative ad campaign can take you a long way.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The great Internet land grab continues.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce pioneers, some with huge advertising budgets, are out
to generate sales, surely, but they're also looking to build brand
loyalty, capture ``mindshare'' and squash the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has in effect become advertising's newest category.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Web sites and Internet services is invading
every media vehicle, from prime time TV to local newspapers, as
well as a host of creative new venues, from store kiosks to
18-wheelers. And it's growing more pervasive every day.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet fashion frontier, where a dominant player such
as Amazon.com has yet to emerge, competition is intense. The
medium's exponential sales growth and potential are adding fuel to
the flame, making advertising more crucial than ever, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   New online business is indeed up for grabs in fashion and
related categories. Total Internet retail sales are projected at
$14.9 billion for 1999 and $23.1 billion for 2000, up from $7.8
billion in 1998. Fashion, footwear, health and personal care areas
should generate around $1 billion in 1999, and $1.9 billion for
2000, according to Jupiter Communications, a New York consulting
firm that tracks the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With an infusion of new investment money from recent IPOs and
venture capital, young online companies are stepping up to the
plate with multi-million-dollar advertising budgets that in some
cases rival total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly.com, a designer outlet with 200 brands at discount
prices, had a second-quarter 1999 marketing budget of $2.48
million, compared with sales of $1.14 million for the same period.
And with a $10 million capital infusion from financier George
Soros, the company is expected to spend heavily over the next three
years to build business, with advertising an important priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to gain share of mind, to dominate, and it's something
we intend to do with a big commitment over the next few years, not
over the next few generations,'' said Ken Seiff, chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly.com's campaign _ a stylized woman in a lounge chair with
a martini and Chinese takeout food _ includes the copy ``Tuesday,
11:15 p.m. _ buying a new dress.'' Rather than touting discount
prices, the message stresses the benefits and convenience of
Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Camdens, a Web site focusing on upscale corporate
gifts, uses advertising to promote a message of luxury,
personalization and customization, one that sharply contrasts with
much of today's offbeat Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the avalanche of dot-com advertising, many companies use
shock value, such as shooting gerbils out of a cannon, to get
attention,'' said Fred Reffsin, ceo of Camdens. ``We're trying to
emphasize services, image and what the Internet can do for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reffsin said the money and time it takes to acquire new
customers is justified by the enormous potential of the gift
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, we can be a first mover, so we have to get out a
strong, compelling message,'' he said. ``It takes money and time to
convince people to change shopping behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' annual advertising budget of over $20 million includes
a combination of broadcast and print media to build its brand
image.
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' target customer represents a ``new luxury buyer,''
Reffsin said. The new luxury customer, who may come from
middle-class origins, buys for personal rewards, rather than
status, he continued. ``Unique product, such as a teak mousepad and
matching monitor, stands for individualized expression for the
sender as well as the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the name out, in any way possible, is the first step in
brand building, a challenge that can be especially daunting and
expensive to new, relatively unknown companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora.com, which launched a beauty Web site this month, has a
leg up by having established stores first, said Jim Kenney, ceo.
With 33 U.S. stores, and 50 scheduled by yearend, the two channels
are designed to complement each other. Customers can reorder store
items online and return online items at stores.
</P>
<P>
   A $25 million ad campaign features a strong fourth-quarter push
that integrates the store and web site messages, which both stress
ease of shopping and elegant presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond traditional offline media, online advertising is evolving
from simple banners to partnerships, such as portal agreements.
That alone can cost millions. Online advertising, which totaled
$2.8 billion in 1999, allows focused, targeted messages that reach
potential shoppers and result in sales conversions, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, such as Fashionmall.com, seek a smart strategy
through a combination of offline and online advertising that pays
off in measurable costs and sales results.
</P>
<P>
   In business since 1994, Fashionmall.com is ancient compared with

THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF ROCKWELL, PAINTER OF ORDINARY LIFE

By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even Norman Rockwell's own life resembled a Norman Rockwell
painting. While Rockwell was painting his endearing visual bromides
about an America many hoped for but few actually experienced _
tousle-haired kids mischievously trespassing into a swimming hole,
townfolks spreading innocent gossip, an extended family gathering
for a bountiful Thanksgiving meal _ he was also working his way
through three marriages.
</P>
<P>
   He and his first wife routinely pursued extramarital affairs;
his second wife was checked into a mental hospital and may have
attempted suicide before dying early of a heart attack. Rockwell
struggled with racist editors who forbade his including
non-subservient blacks in his work, his own depression and a
workaholic nature and self-doubts about his own place in the
pantheon of contemporary artists.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, all this is revealed gently, among more
comforting and benign anecdotes, in ``Norman Rockwell: Painting
America,'' another in a series of ``American Masters''
documentaries about the arts. It's a timely special, coming on the
heels of a Rockwell retrospective in New York and a positive
critical reassessment in the sober pages of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Elena Mannes tracks down interviewees ranging
from art critic Robert Hughes to filmmaker Steven Spielberg (who,
too neatly, speaks of Rockwell in cinematic terms) to his son Peter
Rockwell and some of his models. Mannes digs up clips in which
Rockwell is interviewed by both Edward R. Murrow and Joey Bishop.
When Rockwell tells Bishop his favorite artist is Rembrandt,
Bishop's studio audience applauds him as if he has mentioned that
he works with disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   From all this, she forms a solid portrait of a seemingly regular
guy who, pipe always at the ready, played up his avuncular image _
he even agreed to a contest sponsored by a cat food company to
paint a winner and his or her cat. She hints, of course, that he
was no doubt far more complex than anyone realized or even bothered
to discern. Tales of how Rockwell came to paint some of his famous
works make him seem both acutely sensitive and like a hack.
</P>
<P>
   Mannes skirts the issue of Rockwell's legacy somewhat
diplomatically. Art historians on hand here particularly decry his
efforts to inject meaning into his work, while Spielberg calls one
such painting one of Rockwell's best.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell himself always fretted over whether he was a credible
serious artist, and so what if he wasn't? He was indisputably an
excellent craftsman and a warm-hearted illustrator with a keen eye
for detail. He was well-paid for his efforts and, as Spielberg puts
it, he ``painted the American Dream better than anyone.'' Who needs
high-brow accolades on top of that?
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Norman Rockwell: Painting America.'' &QL; 
What: Documentary from the ``American Masters'' series about the
beloved painter of Americana.  &QL;

MILLENNIAL MUSCLE: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BATTLES HELL ITSELF IN
`END OF DAYS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Arnold Schwarzenegger in a scene from
``End of Days.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Arnold is back.
 &HT;    After a two-year absence from the big screen, including time
spent recovering from heart surgery, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the
king of action films, is out to reclaim his crown. And the fight
commences with the millennial thriller ``End of Days.''
 &HT;    But this isn't quite the Arnold we used to know. The new film
offers up a more sensitive, less invincible Schwarzenegger, with
the 52-year-old uberstar cast as a suicidal security specialist who
finds himself trying to save a young woman (Robin Tunney) _ not to
mention the world _ from the Devil himself (Gabriel Byrne).
Naturally, Schwarzenegger must accomplish his task before the clock
strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, 1999.
 &HT;    How different is ``End of Days'' from, say, ``The Terminator''
(1984) or ``Eraser'' (1996)? Well, the big guy mopes. He cries. He
even gets beaten up by a little old lady.
 &HT;    ``It was very important to do the film in such a way that it
causes surprises all the way through,'' Schwarzenegger says,
looking hale and hearty during a press conference at New York's
Essex House hotel. ``Therefore we did not want to go in the
traditional way, which is that you come in as the hero, the knight
in shining armor, and the audience knows right away, `Ah, he's the
hero, he's perfect. He's going to kick some butt over here and he's
going to wipe out the enemy.'
 &HT;    ``That worked in the '80s and in the early '90s, but that
doesn't work today,'' the actor says. ``That's why I chose `End of
Days.' First of all, it shows the character as very vulnerable,
which is quite important. No. 2, it had all the twists and turns.
 &HT;    ``People never really know what's going to happen,'' he says.
``Here I start out for the first time with a gun to my head,
wanting to take my life. It's also the first time I'm on drugs, on
alcohol. I've lost my family. I've lost my job, my friends. This is
the end of the rope, and it's something I've never played.''
 &HT;    Schwarzenegger is on a roll.
 &HT;    ``People don't know, with this vulnerability, will the Devil
have success in seducing me?'' the actor says. ``Will I eventually
become possessed by the Devil? So the vulnerability factor was very
important in what I'd do to make the story work.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' he adds, ``on the other side of the coin,
we had to show the power of the Devil, what influence he has over
people. That made the stepmother/nanny, even though she's maybe a
65-year-old woman, extremely powerful internally and externally.
 &HT;    ``She threw me around like a doll,'' Schwarzenegger says,
chuckling heartily. ``When I read that, it was one of my favorite
scenes in the movie, because it's one of those you've never seen
before.
 &HT;    ``It's normally me always kicking butt,'' he says. ``For me to
get the beating, for me to go down and down and down in this movie,
and then have an arc where I can come back ...
 &HT;    ``Also,'' he adds, ``you realize that the gun power is not
really the ultimate power. It is something else, and that's the
basic message.''
 &HT;    Big news for a guy whose movies used to throw guns around the
way the Three Stooges threw pies. But the former Terminator insists
that the movie is all the more powerful for its greater emotional
range.
 &HT;    ``I didn't act the crying,'' says Schwarzenegger, who is married
to television personality Maria Shriver and has four children.
``You have to dig down deep inside and find the moments that are
very upsetting and do make you cry. Anybody who has a family, who
has children, very quickly thoughts can come to your mind that make
you cry.
 &HT;    ``At this point in my life, that was not the most difficult
thing to do,'' he says. ``I think the most challenging thing was
the acting and to always act out the vulnerability, the
helplessness.
 &HT;    ``Even though I pull myself together as a character and go, `OK,
now we're going to get some answers. Now we're going to do this,'
the fact of the matter is there was nowhere to go unless the
character changes as a person and I get rid of my hostilities and
my anger, and unless I look at faith as an option, look at inner
strength as an option.''
 &HT;    Born and raised a Catholic, Schwarzenegger says that he remains
committed to the Church.
 &HT;    ``I do have more faith now than I did when I was younger,'' he
adds, ``because my mother took me to church every Sunday, and to me
it was just an obligation so I didn't get smacked across the
face!''
 &HT;    The actor laughs loudly.
 &HT;    ``And then, later on, when I had a chance to rebel when I was 18
or 19 and I came to the United States and was riding high, being
the bodybuilding champion and all of that, I never went to
church,'' he recalls. ``I thought the whole thing was absolutely
absurd.
 &HT;    ``Then, when you get older _ and especially when you start
having children _ the whole thing comes back without anybody even
telling you.
 &HT;    ``The circle comes around again,'' Schwarzenegger says. ``You
start thinking about all the things your parents did and the things
that you rebelled against. It all of a sudden makes sense now, and
you're doing the teaching to your kids.
 &HT;    ``Then they'll rebel, and it's a continuous cycle.''
 &HT;    Schwarzenegger may have been off the screen for a while, but
he's making up for lost time. In early December he'll head up to
Vancouver, B.C., to shoot ``The Sixth Day,'' a cloning thriller.
After that he'll pick a new project from among ``Doc Savage,''
based on the classic pulp-novel character, and possible sequels to
``Total Recall'' (1990) and ``True Lies'' (1994).
 &HT;    He'd consider a ``Terminator 3,'' he adds, but only if director
James Cameron agreed to join him in making the film.
 &HT;    Not on his list, despite much-talked-about comments he made in a
recent magazine interview, is a run for public office.
 &HT;    ``I don't have anything planned,'' says Schwarzenegger, a
longtime Republican. ``I have thought about it several times ...
but right now I'm too heavily in show business.
 &HT;    ``I enjoy making movies,'' he says, ``and there are many more I
want to do. I don't see myself jumping ship and doing something
else yet.
 &HT;    ``Will it happen down the line? Could it happen?'' He pauses.
``Yes, it's possible.''
 &HT;    What's not possible, Schwarzenegger says, is his ever being won
over by the Devil.
 &HT;    ``There is no offer that he can make me, because I know _ from
all the research I've done and all my personal experience _
everything he has to offer me is a temporary pleasure,'' he says.
``That includes what you see in the movie ... That's the way it is
with the Devil, and you have to know that.
 &HT;    ``All the things that are easy to come by, that taste good, that
are good, that bring pleasure, could potentially backfire on you,''
he concludes. ``So you should not look at the easy way out, but
should set your goal, go for that and not get distracted by
anything else.''
 &HT;    Amen, Arnold.

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He starred in ``The Player,'' but Tim Robbins refuses to play
the Hollywood game.
 &HT;    He avoids power lunches. He takes two years off to regroup
between films. And, oh yes, he makes strange movies about the
production of real-life plays back in the 1930s.
 &HT;    Tom Cruise he ain't. Brad Pitt he ain't.
 &HT;    ``Those guys are major players,'' Robbins says cheerfully.
``They have to deal with all the Hollywood hoopla.''
 &HT;    Well, now, of course Robbins has starred in some major studio
productions himself _ think ``Bull Durham'' (1988) and ``The
Shawshank Redemption'' (1994) _ and, for that matter, teams with
Susan Sarandon as one of Hollywood's favorite offscreen couples.
She even won an Oscar for her role as a Death Row nun in ``Dead Man
Walking'' (1994), a major-studio production directed by ... Robbins
himself.
 &HT;    ``Oh no, I'm not a player. I'm not in the inner club,'' the
41-year-old actor/director insists, widening his eyes and
contorting his round, practically ageless baby face into a smile.
``And I don't think I would like to be a player, because that's a
lot of fussability.''
 &HT;    Dressed casually in a white tank top, a gauzy beige shirt and
khaki pants, Robbins is at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel for a
breakfast interview to promote ``Cradle Will Rock.''
 &HT;    That's his latest film as a director, opening Dec. 3. And, yes,
it's a $25 million film about the real-life production of a play _
the controversial 1937 musical drama ``The Cradle Will Rock'' by
Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) _ more than 60 years ago.
 &HT;    When the play was dubbed an ``attack on capitalism,'' the WPA
Theatre canceled it. But the producers, including director Orson
Welles (Angus Macfayden) and actor/director John Houseman (Cary
Elwes) moved the show to another theater nearby, where it was
performed without scenery, props or costumes.
 &HT;    It became a hit and landed on Broadway.
 &HT;    ``To me,'' Robbins says, ``it's really about censorship and how
far an artist will go to have his or her voice heard by the
masses.''
 &HT;    Sarandon appears in the film, but it took a bit of negotiation,
Robbins adds.
 &HT;    ``After `Dead Man Walking,''' he says, ``Susan said she would
only work with me again if she could wear mascara and wear nice
clothes.''
 &HT;    Actually, given its political theme, ``Cradle Will Rock'' was a
natural for Sarandon, who _ like Robbins _ is a longtime liberal
advocate.
 &HT;    ``Please don't call this a political film,'' Robbins implores.
``I'm not interested in politics or political statements _ I'm
interested in telling stories about individuals and human
courage.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he's quick to note that he strongly opposes
censorship and favors government funding of the arts _ with,
naturally, a spin of his own.
 &HT;    ``I can argue it either way,'' he says. ``Too much support is
bad. If there's not enough for an artist to be angry about and
overcome, I think it limits what that person is willing to say. I
think great art often comes out of deprivation and struggle.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' he continues, ``if I'm going to give $10
to the government, I'd like to see $9 spent on culture. That's only
my personal opinion.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if we could run the country on that budget,'' he
says. ``But it would be a heck of a lot of fun.''
 &HT;    His latest directing effort talks about the idea of ``selling
out'' as an artist.
 &HT;    ``I've been there,'' he admits. ``I've done some cheesy
movies.''
 &HT;    Still, he says, he tries to retain some integrity.
 &HT;    ``You know what? I turned down $6 million the other day,'' he
says. ``It was a pretty good script, but I didn't want to do that
particular role.''
 &HT;    And, no, it wasn't easy.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, it hurts,'' Robbins says. ``But I've turned down money a
lot. I've said no to violent movies, I've said no to movies that
exploit women. I will not do a movie where there's a female
character who is simply there to be nude and have sex.
 &HT;    ``If I'm killing somebody in a script just to satisfy the most
basic needs of the audience, I will not be in that movie.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``Then I go out and I see the actors who took those roles become
big stars,'' he says. ``I see them making even bigger money. And
sometimes I do wince a little bit.''
 &HT;    But that's the price you pay when you're a politically sensitive
actor/director who'd rather do a controversial money-loser like
``Bob Roberts'' (1992) than ``Mission Impossible XII.''
 &HT;    ``A politically sensitive actor,'' Robbins snorts. ``That's an
oxymoron!
 &HT;    ``Anyway, I hate the word `political,''' he adds. ``It implies
you're doing something for a beneficial reason for yourself _ if
you think about a politician making a political decision, they're
thinking about what's best for them.
 &HT;    ``And I don't have anything to do with politics,'' Robbins says
cheerfully. ``I hate politics. I hate politicians.''
 &HT;    The words he prefers are ``socially cs,'' which covers a
range of concerns from feminism and the death penalty to
environmentalism and foreign arms sales.
 &HT;    It all began when he was growing up in New York's bohemian
Greenwich Village, he says.
 &HT;    ``Right now, I have an image of myself as a kid walking down the
street with my baseball glove,'' he recalls. ``And I'm walking past
some of the most exciting and strange people of the generation, and
not knowing I'm walking past them.
 &HT;    ``For instance, Bob Dylan lived right around the corner from
me,'' he says. ``I can actually dream a movie about it.''
 &HT;    Acting was a happy accident.
 &HT;    ``My sisters were involved in a theater company,'' he says,
``and I joined that at 12 years old. Basically, I was interested in
stealing some attention from my sisters. And it worked.
 &HT;    ``I think also I was at a stage where it was also about girls,''
Robbins says. ``And I think girls did like me better as an actor _
I remember the first time I did a play, all of a sudden I had a
girlfriend.''
 &HT;    He studied theater at UCLA, and in 1981 founded a theatrical
group, The Actor's Gang.
 &HT;    He met Sarandon on the set of ``Bull Durham,'' and the two have
been together for 12 years. They have two children together, as
well as her teen-age daughter, but have never married.
 &HT;    You'd think they would have, simply to avoid having to answer
the same questions, over and over again, about why they haven't
tied the knot.
 &HT;    ``I'm a supporter of the institution of marriage,'' Robbins says
patiently, ``and wholeheartedly stand by other people's right to
get married. It's just that I have no desire to get married, which
is a personal choice.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the two continue to live a very married life, somehow
juggling child-rearing and two busy Hollywood careers. Plus, of
course, a little political activism.
 &HT;    Not that Robbins would ever pull a Warren Beatty and flirt with
running for high office.
 &HT;    ``Me as president?'' he says, laughing hard. ``Maybe in another
`Austin Powers' movie.
 &HT;    ``But in real life? That would be a disaster!''

PATRICK STEWART AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SCROOGE

 (Includes a color slide of Patrick Stewart in a scene from ``A
Christmas Carol.'') 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Only 12 years ago, Patrick Stewart had never even read ``A
Christmas Carol.''
 &HT;    He'd spent his whole life reading Shakespeare, Marlowe, Dickens
and the rest of the great-British-authors canon, but it was one of
those books that he sort of felt like he already knew without
bothering to read.
 &HT;    That changed when he finally did read it, in preparation for a
public reading he'd agreed to do at a benefit for the
organ-restoration fund at the Yorkshire church he had attended as a
child.
 &HT;    It's not too much to say that it changed his life. Three years
later, the English actor _ still best known as Capt. Picard in
television's long-running ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and
its big-screen sequels _ opened on Broadway in a one-man show.
Alone on stage, without sets, makeup or props, he performed ``A
Christmas Carol,'' playing 40 different characters to glowing
reviews and packed houses.
 &HT;    Every Christmas season since 1991, Stewart has performed the
show either in the United States or Britain. Despite numerous
offers, however, he has never mounted a fully dramatized version of
the story.
 &HT;    That ends Dec. 5, when Turner Network Television presents ``A
Christmas Carol,'' starring Stewart as Ebenezer Scrooge. Speaking
by telephone from Canada, where he is playing teen-mutant-mentor
Charles Xavier in the big-budget ``The X-Men,'' Stewart admits that
he'd had his reservations.
 &HT;    ``You might ask, why another `Christmas Carol?''' Stewart says.
``It's probably the most adapted work in the world, after the
Bible. Do we really need another one?''
 &HT;    His answer was an emphatic yes, as long as the television
version retained the key aspects of the original novel, which have
been softened in many of the adaptations.
 &HT;    ``Dickens the social critic was so present in `A Christmas
Carol,''' says the actor, a lifelong Socialist who heartily
endorses the story's underlying humanistic, anti-capitalist
message. ``Dickens was illustrating the impact of the economic
philosophy of someone like Scrooge on society. And after living
through Thatcherism and Reaganism, we are certainly familiar with
that in the West.
 &HT;    ``Scrooge is a proponent of market forces _ the strong must
prosper, and the weak will just have to do the best they can. And
if they have to go, well, they just have to go.''
 &HT;    Stewart also responds to the story on a personal level.
 &HT;    ``All of us are affected by the concept of a second chance,'' he
says. ``We have all thought, `If only I had this to do over again.'
And Ebenezer is given that chance.
 &HT;    ``Scrooge's experience was such that it led him to believe that
he couldn't rely on happiness, he couldn't depend on love, he
couldn't rely on something pleasant being forever,'' the actor
says. ``And therefore he cut himself off from being vulnerable to
that ever again.''
 &HT;    One of Stewart's closest friends, Bernard Lloyd, plays Marley in
the television movie. He told him that he thought Stewart would go
on playing Scrooge ``until I finally exorcised the Scrooge in
myself.''
 &HT;    It rang a bell, Stewart admits.
 &HT;    ``It's really just a question of withholding when you could be
more generous,'' he says thoughtfully. ``We run for cover so often.
It can be frightening to live openly in this world. In many
respects many of us are tortoises _ we pull our heads in.''
 &HT;    Stewart was born in northern England, the youngest of three
brothers. He discovered acting at 12, when a teacher asked him to
play the role of a schoolboy in a local amateur production. The
young Stewart felt immediately at home on stage, he recalls,
finding it an inexplicably comfortable, safe and familiar place to
be.
 &HT;    Acting soon became his passion, almost his obsession _ Stewart
recalls that, at 16, he found himself rehearsing for six different
plays at one time. After graduating from secondary school he
performed in the provinces, then was accepted into London's
prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, where he spent 12 years
working with such esteemed directors as Peter Hall, Peter Brook and
Trevor Nunn.
 &HT;    They were only the latest in a series of mentors who had
inculcated the traditions of the British theater into the young
actor.
 &HT;    ``Certain standards were set that had to do with
professionalism, but they also influence how you live,'' he
recalls. ``The company you keep makes a difference. Things begin to
rub off.''
 &HT;    Bloodlines help, too. His mother had enjoyed acting, Stewart
says, frequently performing with an all-female theater group at the
local Methodist church. On his father's side, he later learned, his
grandfather had actually been a professional actor.
 &HT;    ``He was never spoken of, because he was the black sheep of the
family,'' Stewart says. ``He had deserted my grandmother and their
four small children. His name was William Stewart, and reportedly
he came to America and established a career here.''
 &HT;    Although Stewart maintains a home in the English countryside,
not far from where he grew up, he spends most of his working time
in the United States. In addition to his ``Star Trek'' credits, he
has also appeared in a number of feature films, among them
``Jeffrey'' (1996) and ``Conspiracy Theory'' (1996), as well as
such television programs as ``The Canterville Ghost'' (1995) and
``Animal Farm'' (1999), as the voice of Napoleon the pig. He has
done a great deal of Shakespeare throughout his career, including a
stint on Broadway two years ago in ``The Tempest.''
 &HT;    Just as writers are frequently accused of writing basically the
same story over and over again, Stewart says, actors have a
tendency to keep returning to similar themes.
 &HT;    ``I have certainly seen a pattern in my choices over the past 10
or 15 years, and it doesn't make a very rosy picture,'' he admits
with a rueful laugh. ``Prospero, Captain Ahab, Othello, a role I
did in an Arthur Miller play last year _ they are all people
possessed by different things and trying to free themselves from
that obsession.''
 &HT;    Many of his characters also are noteworthy for their
self-destructive streaks.
 &HT;    ``That connects them, too, and it's not accidental,'' he says,
``although I often don't realize it until after I take the part.
That's one of the wonderful things about being an actor _ we get a
chance, as in the most effective therapy, to play out the themes.
 &HT;    ``I hope I can exorcise the Scrooge in myself without doing `A
Christmas Carol' forever and ever.''
 &HT;    But ``A Christmas Carol'' has been a constant in Stewart's life
for many years now, and he admits that the book which took him so
long to get to still fascinates him.
 &HT;    ``Here's this little Victorian novelette, easily overlooked,
frequently written off as a minor Dickens, a Victorian sentiment,''
he says. ``And yet it proves to be one of the most potent morality
tales in the English language.''

 (Includes a color slide of Steve Bisley and Zoe Carides in a scene
from ``General Practice.'') 
 By JUDITH ANDERSON  
 c.1999 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before there was ``E.R.,'' there was ``G.P.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Chicago Hope,'' ``L.A. Doctors'' or ``Providence,'' in
fact, while the doctor shows in this country consisted largely of
reruns of ``Marcus Welby'' or even ``Ben Casey,'' ``General
Practice'' was racking up every major television award in
Australia. From 1989 to 1996 it topped the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to suggest that it was a progenitor of the recent
barrage of American medical dramas, but now that it's being shown
in the United States on various syndication outlets, comparisons
are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the big difference: In the Australian series, neither
the physicians nor the patients think the doctor is God.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Practice'' is low-key and low-tech. No adrenaline
overdrive. No closeups of throbbing, bloody things on the operating
table. No arrogance. These docs make house calls, and they bring
their personal lives to work just like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Practice'' focuses on the staff of the Ross Street
Surgery, a busy suburban medical practice. The central characters
include three doctors: The crusty, orthodox senior partner (Michael
Craig), an intense young woman (Zoe Carides) and a 40-something
army doctor (Steve Bisley) who has retired and taken up a civilian
practice in a final attempt to salvage his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   We see them in the round, so to speak, not only at times of
crisis. They're not specialists, so they routinely treat the whole
patient rather than merely his or her symptoms, and they seldom
rely on modern medicine's most sophisticated technology or its
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a cultural difference rather than a creative
one,'' Bisley says. ``In Australia, now as in the past, a general
practitioner usually operates in the suburbs and is very much a
part of his community _ a well-known part. He treats entire
families. If he lives long enough, he treats entire generations.
His reputation rests on good will and his ability to integrate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the episode that introduced Bisley's character, Dr. Henry
King, to the Ross Street practice, his ability to ``integrate'' was
tested by his new job and his new status as a recently separated
spouse and parent. His patients and colleagues were wary, and his
furious wife dumped a truckload of fill dirt across his gate _ a
perfect example of the show's trademark blend of medical and
personal drama with a touch of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the 13 episodes being broadcast in the show's
first American airing, Dr. King faces divorce, struggles with the
challenges of weekend parenting, copes with being single again, has
to change his military bedside manner to suit a civilian practice
and, eventually, develops a romance with Carides' character, Dr.
Sonia Kapek.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions and conditions men his age universally
face,'' says Bisley, who himself is close to Dr. King's age.
``There's confusion about roles, the disintegration of the family,
the pressures put on men without adequate support. They were
questions that interested me as a person as well as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bisley is one of Australia's big stars _ probably best
known to American audiences as Jim Goose in the film ``Mad Max''
(1979) _ Henry King is not at the center of each story. In fact,
the viewpoint frequently shifts away from any of the principal
characters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one recent episode explores the ethics of a
couple's having a baby in order to use its umbilical-cord blood to
treat their daughter, who has leukemia. Sonia Kapek is their
general practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings between parents and doctor, the viewer picks up
information about the use of cord blood instead of a bone-marrow
transplant. Dr. Kapek moves the plot along, learning from
11-year-old Emily that she is no longer in remission, informing the
parents that the fetal blood does not match Emily's and urging the
mother to reconsider her decision to abort the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kapek acts as a catalyst and voices the moral concerns, but
in the hour-long episode she is on screen for less than 15 minutes.
Script and camera stay with the parties concerned, and when Emily
claps on headphones to block out her parents' angry, anguished
debate, we hear the argument as she does, through a barrage of hard
rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Practice'' isn't always about life and death. Mostly
it's just about life.

MILLENNIAL MUSCLE: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BATTLES HELL ITSELF IN
`END OF DAYS'

 (Includes a color slide of Arnold Schwarzenegger in a scene from
``End of Days.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Arnold is back.
 &HT;    After a two-year absence from the big screen, including time
spent recovering from heart surgery, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the
king of action films, is out to reclaim his crown. And the fight
commences with the millennial thriller ``End of Days.''
 &HT;    But this isn't quite the Arnold we used to know. The new film
offers up a more sensitive, less invincible Schwarzenegger, with
the 52-year-old uberstar cast as a suicidal security specialist who
finds himself trying to save a young woman (Robin Tunney) _ not to
mention the world _ from the Devil himself (Gabriel Byrne).
Naturally, Schwarzenegger must accomplish his task before the clock
strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, 1999.
 &HT;    How different is ``End of Days'' from, say, ``The Terminator''
(1984) or ``Eraser'' (1996)? Well, the big guy mopes. He cries. He
even gets beaten up by a little old lady.
 &HT;    ``It was very important to do the film in such a way that it
causes surprises all the way through,'' Schwarzenegger says,
looking hale and hearty during a press conference at New York's
Essex House hotel. ``Therefore we did not want to go in the
traditional way, which is that you come in as the hero, the knight
in shining armor, and the audience knows right away, `Ah, he's the
hero, he's perfect. He's going to kick some butt over here and he's
going to wipe out the enemy.'
 &HT;    ``That worked in the '80s and in the early '90s, but that
doesn't work today,'' the actor says. ``That's why I chose `End of
Days.' First of all, it shows the character as very vulnerable,
which is quite important. No. 2, it had all the twists and turns.
 &HT;    ``People never really know what's going to happen,'' he says.
``Here I start out for the first time with a gun to my head,
wanting to take my life. It's also the first time I'm on drugs, on
alcohol. I've lost my family. I've lost my job, my friends. This is
the end of the rope, and it's something I've never played.''
 &HT;    Schwarzenegger is on a roll.
 &HT;    ``People don't know, with this vulnerability, will the Devil
have success in seducing me?'' the actor says. ``Will I eventually
become possessed by the Devil? So the vulnerability factor was very
important in what I'd do to make the story work.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' he adds, ``on the other side of the coin,
we had to show the power of the Devil, what influence he has over
people. That made the stepmother/nanny, even though she's maybe a
65-year-old woman, extremely powerful internally and externally.
 &HT;    ``She threw me around like a doll,'' Schwarzenegger says,
chuckling heartily. ``When I read that, it was one of my favorite
scenes in the movie, because it's one of those you've never seen
before.
 &HT;    ``It's normally me always kicking butt,'' he says. ``For me to
get the beating, for me to go down and down and down in this movie,
and then have an arc where I can come back ...
 &HT;    ``Also,'' he adds, ``you realize that the gun power is not
really the ultimate power. It is something else, and that's the
basic message.''
 &HT;    Big news for a guy whose movies used to throw guns around the
way the Three Stooges threw pies. But the former Terminator insists
that the movie is all the more powerful for its greater emotional
range.
 &HT;    ``I didn't act the crying,'' says Schwarzenegger, who is married
to television personality Maria Shriver and has four children.
``You have to dig down deep inside and find the moments that are
very upsetting and do make you cry. Anybody who has a family, who
has children, very quickly thoughts can come to your mind that make
you cry.
 &HT;    ``At this point in my life, that was not the most difficult
thing to do,'' he says. ``I think the most challenging thing was
the acting and to always act out the vulnerability, the
helplessness.
 &HT;    ``Even though I pull myself together as a character and go, `OK,
now we're going to get some answers. Now we're going to do this,'
the fact of the matter is there was nowhere to go unless the
character changes as a person and I get rid of my hostilities and
my anger, and unless I look at faith as an option, look at inner
strength as an option.''
 &HT;    Born and raised a Catholic, Schwarzenegger says that he remains
committed to the Church.
 &HT;    ``I do have more faith now than I did when I was younger,'' he
adds, ``because my mother took me to church every Sunday, and to me
it was just an obligation so I didn't get smacked across the
face!''
 &HT;    The actor laughs loudly.
 &HT;    ``And then, later on, when I had a chance to rebel when I was 18
or 19 and I came to the United States and was riding high, being
the bodybuilding champion and all of that, I never went to
church,'' he recalls. ``I thought the whole thing was absolutely
absurd.
 &HT;    ``Then, when you get older _ and especially when you start
having children _ the whole thing comes back without anybody even
telling you.
 &HT;    ``The circle comes around again,'' Schwarzenegger says. ``You
start thinking about all the things your parents did and the things
that you rebelled against. It all of a sudden makes sense now, and
you're doing the teaching to your kids.
 &HT;    ``Then they'll rebel, and it's a continuous cycle.''
 &HT;    Schwarzenegger may have been off the screen for a while, but
he's making up for lost time. In early December he'll head up to
Vancouver, B.C., to shoot ``The Sixth Day,'' a cloning thriller.
After that he'll pick a new project from among ``Doc Savage,''
based on the classic pulp-novel character, and possible sequels to
``Total Recall'' (1990) and ``True Lies'' (1994).
 &HT;    He'd consider a ``Terminator 3,'' he adds, but only if director
James Cameron agreed to join him in making the film.
 &HT;    Not on his list, despite much-talked-about comments he made in a
recent magazine interview, is a run for public office.
 &HT;    ``I don't have anything planned,'' says Schwarzenegger, a
longtime Republican. ``I have thought about it several times ...
but right now I'm too heavily in show business.
 &HT;    ``I enjoy making movies,'' he says, ``and there are many more I
want to do. I don't see myself jumping ship and doing something
else yet.
 &HT;    ``Will it happen down the line? Could it happen?'' He pauses.
``Yes, it's possible.''
 &HT;    What's not possible, Schwarzenegger says, is his ever being won
over by the Devil.
 &HT;    ``There is no offer that he can make me, because I know _ from
all the research I've done and all my personal experience _
everything he has to offer me is a temporary pleasure,'' he says.
``That includes what you see in the movie ... That's the way it is
with the Devil, and you have to know that.
 &HT;    ``All the things that are easy to come by, that taste good, that
are good, that bring pleasure, could potentially backfire on you,''
he concludes. ``So you should not look at the easy way out, but
should set your goal, go for that and not get distracted by
anything else.''
 &HT;    Amen, Arnold.

TIM ROBBINS: FILLING THE `CRADLE' WITH THE POLITICS OF ART

 (Includes a color slide of Tim Robbins directing a scene from
``Cradle Will Rock.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He starred in ``The Player,'' but Tim Robbins refuses to play
the Hollywood game.
 &HT;    He avoids power lunches. He takes two years off to regroup
between films. And, oh yes, he makes strange movies about the
production of real-life plays back in the 1930s.
 &HT;    Tom Cruise he ain't. Brad Pitt he ain't.
 &HT;    ``Those guys are major players,'' Robbins says cheerfully.
``They have to deal with all the Hollywood hoopla.''
 &HT;    Well, now, of course Robbins has starred in some major studio
productions himself _ think ``Bull Durham'' (1988) and ``The
Shawshank Redemption'' (1994) _ and, for that matter, teams with
Susan Sarandon as one of Hollywood's favorite offscreen couples.
She even won an Oscar for her role as a Death Row nun in ``Dead Man
Walking'' (1994), a major-studio production directed by ... Robbins
himself.
 &HT;    ``Oh no, I'm not a player. I'm not in the inner club,'' the
41-year-old actor/director insists, widening his eyes and
contorting his round, practically ageless baby face into a smile.
``And I don't think I would like to be a player, because that's a
lot of fussability.''
 &HT;    Dressed casually in a white tank top, a gauzy beige shirt and
khaki pants, Robbins is at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel for a
breakfast interview to promote ``Cradle Will Rock.''
 &HT;    That's his latest film as a director, opening Dec. 3. And, yes,
it's a $25 million film about the real-life production of a play _
the controversial 1937 musical drama ``The Cradle Will Rock'' by
Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) _ more than 60 years ago.
 &HT;    When the play was dubbed an ``attack on capitalism,'' the WPA
Theatre canceled it. But the producers, including director Orson
Welles (Angus Macfayden) and actor/director John Houseman (Cary
Elwes) moved the show to another theater nearby, where it was
performed without scenery, props or costumes.
 &HT;    It became a hit and landed on Broadway.
 &HT;    ``To me,'' Robbins says, ``it's really about censorship and how
far an artist will go to have his or her voice heard by the
masses.''
 &HT;    Sarandon appears in the film, but it took a bit of negotiation,
Robbins adds.
 &HT;    ``After `Dead Man Walking,''' he says, ``Susan said she would
only work with me again if she could wear mascara and wear nice
clothes.''
 &HT;    Actually, given its political theme, ``Cradle Will Rock'' was a
natural for Sarandon, who _ like Robbins _ is a longtime liberal
advocate.
 &HT;    ``Please don't call this a political film,'' Robbins implores.
``I'm not interested in politics or political statements _ I'm
interested in telling stories about individuals and human
courage.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he's quick to note that he strongly opposes
censorship and favors government funding of the arts _ with,
naturally, a spin of his own.
 &HT;    ``I can argue it either way,'' he says. ``Too much support is
bad. If there's not enough for an artist to be angry about and
overcome, I think it limits what that person is willing to say. I
think great art often comes out of deprivation and struggle.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' he continues, ``if I'm going to give $10
to the government, I'd like to see $9 spent on culture. That's only
my personal opinion.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if we could run the country on that budget,'' he
says. ``But it would be a heck of a lot of fun.''
 &HT;    His latest directing effort talks about the idea of ``selling
out'' as an artist.
 &HT;    ``I've been there,'' he admits. ``I've done some cheesy
movies.''
 &HT;    Still, he says, he tries to retain some integrity.
 &HT;    ``You know what? I turned down $6 million the other day,'' he
says. ``It was a pretty good script, but I didn't want to do that
particular role.''
 &HT;    And, no, it wasn't easy.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, it hurts,'' Robbins says. ``But I've turned down money a
lot. I've said no to violent movies, I've said no to movies that
exploit women. I will not do a movie where there's a female
character who is simply there to be nude and have sex.
 &HT;    ``If I'm killing somebody in a script just to satisfy the most
basic needs of the audience, I will not be in that movie.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``Then I go out and I see the actors who took those roles become
big stars,'' he says. ``I see them making even bigger money. And
sometimes I do wince a little bit.''
 &HT;    But that's the price you pay when you're a politically sensitive
actor/director who'd rather do a controversial money-loser like
``Bob Roberts'' (1992) than ``Mission Impossible XII.''
 &HT;    ``A politically sensitive actor,'' Robbins snorts. ``That's an
oxymoron!
 &HT;    ``Anyway, I hate the word `political,''' he adds. ``It implies
you're doing something for a beneficial reason for yourself _ if
you think about a politician making a political decision, they're
thinking about what's best for them.
 &HT;    ``And I don't have anything to do with politics,'' Robbins says
cheerfully. ``I hate politics. I hate politicians.''
 &HT;    The words he prefers are ``socially conscious,'' which covers a
range of concerns from feminism and the death penalty to
environmentalism and foreign arms sales.
 &HT;    It all began when he was growing up in New York's bohemian
Greenwich Village, he says.
 &HT;    ``Right now, I have an image of myself as a kid walking down the
street with my baseball glove,'' he recalls. ``And I'm walking past
some of the most exciting and strange people of the generation, and
not knowing I'm walking past them.
 &HT;    ``For instance, Bob Dylan lived right around the corner from
me,'' he says. ``I can actually dream a movie about it.''
 &HT;    Acting was a happy accident.
 &HT;    ``My sisters were involved in a theater company,'' he says,
``and I joined that at 12 years old. Basically, I was interested in
stealing some attention from my sisters. And it worked.
 &HT;    ``I think also I was at a stage where it was also about girls,''
Robbins says. ``And I think girls did like me better as an actor _
I remember the first time I did a play, all of a sudden I had a
girlfriend.''
 &HT;    He studied theater at UCLA, and in 1981 founded a theatrical
group, The Actor's Gang.
 &HT;    He met Sarandon on the set of ``Bull Durham,'' and the two have
been together for 12 years. They have two children together, as
well as her teen-age daughter, but have never married.
 &HT;    You'd think they would have, simply to avoid having to answer
the same questions, over and over again, about why they haven't
tied the knot.
 &HT;    ``I'm a supporter of the institution of marriage,'' Robbins says
patiently, ``and wholeheartedly stand by other people's right to
get married. It's just that I have no desire to get married, which
is a personal choice.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the two continue to live a very married life, somehow
juggling child-rearing and two busy Hollywood careers. Plus, of
course, a little political activism.
 &HT;    Not that Robbins would ever pull a Warren Beatty and flirt with
running for high office.
 &HT;    ``Me as president?'' he says, laughing hard. ``Maybe in another
`Austin Powers' movie.
 &HT;    ``But in real life? That would be a disaster!''

PATRICK STEWART AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SCROOGE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Patrick Stewart in a scene from ``A
Christmas Carol.'') 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Only 12 years ago, Patrick Stewart had never even read ``A
Christmas Carol.''
 &HT;    He'd spent his whole life reading Shakespeare, Marlowe, Dickens
and the rest of the great-British-authors canon, but it was one of
those books that he sort of felt like he already knew without
bothering to read.
 &HT;    That changed when he finally did read it, in preparation for a
public reading he'd agreed to do at a benefit for the
organ-restoration fund at the Yorkshire church he had attended as a
child.
 &HT;    It's not too much to say that it changed his life. Three years
later, the English actor _ still best known as Capt. Picard in
television's long-running ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and
its big-screen sequels _ opened on Broadway in a one-man show.
Alone on stage, without sets, makeup or props, he performed ``A
Christmas Carol,'' playing 40 different characters to glowing
reviews and packed houses.
 &HT;    Every Christmas season since 1991, Stewart has performed the
show either in the United States or Britain. Despite numerous
offers, however, he has never mounted a fully dramatized version of
the story.
 &HT;    That ends Dec. 5, when Turner Network Television presents ``A
Christmas Carol,'' starring Stewart as Ebenezer Scrooge. Speaking
by telephone from Canada, where he is playing teen-mutant-mentor
Charles Xavier in the big-budget ``The X-Men,'' Stewart admits that
he'd had his reservations.
 &HT;    ``You might ask, why another `Christmas Carol?''' Stewart says.
``It's probably the most adapted work in the world, after the
Bible. Do we really need another one?''
 &HT;    His answer was an emphatic yes, as long as the television
version retained the key aspects of the original novel, which have
been softened in many of the adaptations.
 &HT;    ``Dickens the social critic was so present in `A Christmas
Carol,''' says the actor, a lifelong Socialist who heartily
endorses the story's underlying humanistic, anti-capitalist
message. ``Dickens was illustrating the impact of the economic
philosophy of someone like Scrooge on society. And after living
through Thatcherism and Reaganism, we are certainly familiar with
that in the West.
 &HT;    ``Scrooge is a proponent of market forces _ the strong must
prosper, and the weak will just have to do the best they can. And
if they have to go, well, they just have to go.''
 &HT;    Stewart also responds to the story on a personal level.
 &HT;    ``All of us are affected by the concept of a second chance,'' he
says. ``We have all thought, `If only I had this to do over again.'
And Ebenezer is given that chance.
 &HT;    ``Scrooge's experience was such that it led him to believe that
he couldn't rely on happiness, he couldn't depend on love, he
couldn't rely on something pleasant being forever,'' the actor
says. ``And therefore he cut himself off from being vulnerable to
that ever again.''
 &HT;    One of Stewart's closest friends, Bernard Lloyd, plays Marley in
the television movie. He told him that he thought Stewart would go
on playing Scrooge ``until I finally exorcised the Scrooge in
myself.''
 &HT;    It rang a bell, Stewart admits.
 &HT;    ``It's really just a question of withholding when you could be
more generous,'' he says thoughtfully. ``We run for cover so often.
It can be frightening to live openly in this world. In many
respects many of us are tortoises _ we pull our heads in.''
 &HT;    Stewart was born in northern England, the youngest of three
brothers. He discovered acting at 12, when a teacher asked him to
play the role of a schoolboy in a local amateur production. The
young Stewart felt immediately at home on stage, he recalls,
finding it an inexplicably comfortable, safe and familiar place to
be.
 &HT;    Acting soon became his passion, almost his obsession _ Stewart
recalls that, at 16, he found himself rehearsing for six different
plays at one time. After graduating from secondary school he
performed in the provinces, then was accepted into London's
prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, where he spent 12 years
working with such esteemed directors as Peter Hall, Peter Brook and
Trevor Nunn.
 &HT;    They were only the latest in a series of mentors who had
inculcated the traditions of the British theater into the young
actor.
 &HT;    ``Certain standards were set that had to do with
professionalism, but they also influence how you live,'' he
recalls. ``The company you keep makes a difference. Things begin to
rub off.''
 &HT;    Bloodlines help, too. His mother had enjoyed acting, Stewart
says, frequently performing with an all-female theater group at the
local Methodist church. On his father's side, he later learned, his
grandfather had actually been a professional actor.
 &HT;    ``He was never spoken of, because he was the black sheep of the
family,'' Stewart says. ``He had deserted my grandmother and their
four small children. His name was William Stewart, and reportedly
he came to America and established a career here.''
 &HT;    Although Stewart maintains a home in the English countryside,
not far from where he grew up, he spends most of his working time
in the United States. In addition to his ``Star Trek'' credits, he
has also appeared in a number of feature films, among them
``Jeffrey'' (1996) and ``Conspiracy Theory'' (1996), as well as
such television programs as ``The Canterville Ghost'' (1995) and
``Animal Farm'' (1999), as the voice of Napoleon the pig. He has
done a great deal of Shakespeare throughout his career, including a
stint on Broadway two years ago in ``The Tempest.''
 &HT;    Just as writers are frequently accused of writing basically the
same story over and over again, Stewart says, actors have a
tendency to keep returning to similar themes.
 &HT;    ``I have certainly seen a pattern in my choices over the past 10
or 15 years, and it doesn't make a very rosy picture,'' he admits
with a rueful laugh. ``Prospero, Captain Ahab, Othello, a role I
did in an Arthur Miller play last year _ they are all people
possessed by different things and trying to free themselves from
that obsession.''
 &HT;    Many of his characters also are noteworthy for their
self-destructive streaks.
 &HT;    ``That connects them, too, and it's not accidental,'' he says,
``although I often don't realize it until after I take the part.
That's one of the wonderful things about being an actor _ we get a
chance, as in the most effective therapy, to play out the themes.
 &HT;    ``I hope I can exorcise the Scrooge in myself without doing `A
Christmas Carol' forever and ever.''
 &HT;    But ``A Christmas Carol'' has been a constant in Stewart's life
for many years now, and he admits that the book which took him so
long to get to still fascinates him.
 &HT;    ``Here's this little Victorian novelette, easily overlooked,
frequently written off as a minor Dickens, a Victorian sentiment,''
he says. ``And yet it proves to be one of the most potent morality
tales in the English language.''

 (Includes a color slide of Steve Bisley and Zoe Carides in a scene
from ``General Practice.'') 
 By JUDITH ANDERSON  
 c.1999 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before there was ``E.R.,'' there was ``G.P.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Chicago Hope,'' ``L.A. Doctors'' or ``Providence,'' in
fact, while the doctor shows in this country consisted largely of
reruns of ``Marcus Welby'' or even ``Ben Casey,'' ``General
Practice'' was racking up every major television award in
Australia. From 1989 to 1996 it topped the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to suggest that it was a progenitor of the recent
barrage of American medical dramas, but now that it's being shown
in the United States on various syndication outlets, comparisons
are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the big difference: In the Australian series, neither
the physicians nor the patients think the doctor is God.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Practice'' is low-key and low-tech. No adrenaline
overdrive. No closeups of throbbing, bloody things on the operating
table. No arrogance. These docs make house calls, and they bring
their personal lives to work just like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Practice'' focuses on the staff of the Ross Street
Surgery, a busy suburban medical practice. The central characters
include three doctors: The crusty, orthodox senior partner (Michael
Craig), an intense young woman (Zoe Carides) and a 40-something
army doctor (Steve Bisley) who has retired and taken up a civilian
practice in a final attempt to salvage his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   We see them in the round, so to speak, not only at times of
crisis. They're not specialists, so they routinely treat the whole
patient rather than merely his or her symptoms, and they seldom
rely on modern medicine's most sophisticated technology or its
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a cultural difference rather than a creative
one,'' Bisley says. ``In Australia, now as in the past, a general
practitioner usually operates in the suburbs and is very much a
part of his community _ a well-known part. He treats entire
families. If he lives long enough, he treats entire generations.
His reputation rests on good will and his ability to integrate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the episode that introduced Bisley's character, Dr. Henry
King, to the Ross Street practice, his ability to ``integrate'' was
tested by his new job and his new status as a recently separated
spouse and parent. His patients and colleagues were wary, and his
furious wife dumped a truckload of fill dirt across his gate _ a
perfect example of the show's trademark blend of medical and
personal drama with a touch of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the 13 episodes being broadcast in the show's
first American airing, Dr. King faces divorce, struggles with the
challenges of weekend parenting, copes with being single again, has
to change his military bedside manner to suit a civilian practice
and, eventually, develops a romance with Carides' character, Dr.
Sonia Kapek.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are questions and conditions men his age universally
face,'' says Bisley, who himself is close to Dr. King's age.
``There's confusion about roles, the disintegration of the family,
the pressures put on men without adequate support. They were
questions that interested me as a person as well as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bisley is one of Australia's big stars _ probably best
known to American audiences as Jim Goose in the film ``Mad Max''
(1979) _ Henry King is not at the center of each story. In fact,
the viewpoint frequently shifts away from any of the principal
characters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one recent episode explores the ethics of a
couple's having a baby in order to use its umbilical-cord blood to
treat their daughter, who has leukemia. Sonia Kapek is their
general practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings between parents and doctor, the viewer picks up
information about the use of cord blood instead of a bone-marrow
transplant. Dr. Kapek moves the plot along, learning from
11-year-old Emily that she is no longer in remission, informing the
parents that the fetal blood does not match Emily's and urging the
mother to reconsider her decision to abort the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kapek acts as a catalyst and voices the moral concerns, but
in the hour-long episode she is on screen for less than 15 minutes.
Script and camera stay with the parties concerned, and when Emily
claps on headphones to block out her parents' angry, anguished
debate, we hear the argument as she does, through a barrage of hard
rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Practice'' isn't always about life and death. Mostly
it's just about life.
</P>

   Less a combat movie than an acutely observed look at America on
the brink of change, Ang Lee's ``Ride With the Devil'' is a Civil
War film loaded with subtext. Lee isn't so much interested in
battles or bloodshed _ although there is plenty of both _ as he is
in the passing of the cultural torch. And he captures that moment
rather well.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has always displayed an expert ability for presenting slices
of societal flux. He did it most impressively with his last film,
``The Ice Storm,'' a movie that hit on feelings of isolation and
angst in '70s suburbia. With ``Devil,'' Lee is preoccupied with
examining the death of the Southern way of life and how the Union's
victory emancipated not only the slaves, but other outsiders as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes place on the Missouri-Kansas border, where
Southern Bushwackers and Union Jayhawkers chaotically roam the
countryside, dispensing guerrilla justice as they see fit. In the
movie's opening moments, Lee introduces us to the Confederates and
their families, whose lives are about to be brutally changed by the
encroaching Union army.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing their enemy, the gentlemanly Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet
Ulrich) and his best friend, a quiet German immigrant Jake
``Dutchy'' Roedel (Tobey Maguire) join a group of Bushwackers that,
apart from all the killing, exhibit a courtly grace peculiar to the
horrors of war. One of them even brings along his slave, Daniel
Holt (Jeffrey Wright), who loyally fights on the side of the South
while quietly looking to make his own path.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Jack and Jake hole up outside a
Confederate-friendly home where they meet a young, self-possessed
widow, Sue Lee (pop singer Jewel). As the conflict (and savagery)
intensifies, the film shifts its focus to the three principal
outsiders _ immigrant, slave and young woman _ as they confront the
notion of freedom and its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting Daniel Woodrell's 1987 novel ``Woe to Live On,''
Lee's writing and producing partner James Schamus paints the period
in appropriate shades of gray. Lee continues to amaze with his
ability to deliver small, telling details, a marvelous gift that
makes it easy to overlook some of the film's failings.
</P>
<P>
   Wright is the real find in the ensemble cast, powerfully playing
a character who remains silent (out of necessity) for much of the
film. Jewel, making her film debut, acquits herself nicely, giving
Sue Lee a calm conviction. James Caviezel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and
Simon Baker round out the Bushwackers with impressive style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devil'' isn't always successful in defining its characters,
but its message never wavers: Freedom comes with a price, and
sometimes that means changing a culture. It's a point well taken in
a moment of history where America still struggles to do the right
thing for all of its citizens.

   A big lump of coal arriving just in time for the holidays, the
Arnold Schwarzenegger action vehicle ``End of Days'' tries to wring
entertainment from bloody crucifixions, satanic rituals and a grim
Y2K scenario that will warm the heart of the most ardent doomsday
nut. But the devil is in the details, and this tedious movie offers
little in the way of wit, originality or even competence. It's two
hours of purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of the odious ``Omega Code,'' ``End of
Days'' takes eschatology to even sillier depths by suggesting that
the biggest millennial bug might just be Satan's progeny. This
could all be good fun in the tradition of ``The Omen,'' but instead
it's a mishmash of dull action and over-the-top mysticism wrapped
around Schwarzenegger's muscle-bound persona.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in Vatican City, circa 1979. The pope, making
like Don Vito Corleone, receives word of the imminent birth of the
future Bride of Satan. The Pope's underlings want to murder the
child, but the Holy Father demurs, instructing, basically, that you
gotta have faith.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Satan (Gabriel Byrne) lands in New York City
(where else?) and begins to comb the streets looking for the
now-grown girl, named Christine (what else?). If he finds Christine
(Robin Tunney) and impregnates her, the world will be his. The only
thing stopping him? A suicidal loner cop, played by (who else?)
Ah-nold.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``End of Days'' is sort of educational. For
instance, you learn the following about the Prince of Darkness: He
can raise the dead. He has many friends inside the New York Police
Department. And his urine is highly flammable. Satan must also be a
principal shareholder in Bath &AMP; Body Works, given the number of
candles that seem to follow him around.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of camp needs a director with a little edge, but
instead, ``End of Days'' gives us veteran Peter Hyams, who has a
25-year, 16-film career that does not include one good movie. Hyams
came on board at the 11th hour after the producers' first choice,
commercial director Marcus Nispel, either bailed or was fired.
Either way, it was a good career move for Nispel.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne fares best as Satan, but Al Pacino was a lot more fun in
``The Devil's Advocate.'' But then, Pacino had a little more help.
``End of Days'' merely recycles bits from ``The Terminator,''
``Night of the Living Dead'' and, gulp, ``The Mummy,'' while only
intermittently generating a jolt or two.
</P>
<P>
   There should be a special place in the afterlife for painful
product like this, preferably somewhere along the bottom of the
river Styx. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The film: &LR;  ``End of Days'' (R; intense violence and gore, a
strong sex scene and language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Peter Hyams. Screenplay by Andrew
Marlowe. Released by Universal Pictures. &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   No nation was ever ruined by trade, wrote Benjamin Franklin. But
what about an entire system of government?
</P>
<P>
   That is the big question raised by the trade deal signed by
China and the United States this week, paving the way for China's
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The deal raises plenty of other questions, too. Can U.S.
President Bill Clinton get the deal through Congress? If so, can
China be made to play by the WTO's rules, or will its
obstructionism pull the whole organization apart?
</P>
<P>
   Does China really have the stomach to carry out its
market-opening promises? Or will resistance from hard-liners unseat
the reformers, led by President Jiang Zemin and the prime minister,
Zhu Rongji?
</P>
<P>
   Will the unsettling consequences of entry, indeed, be too much
for ordinary Chinese, putting the spark to a social tinderbox?
</P>
<P>
   The central question, however, is whether Chinese Communism will
be strengthened by membership of the WTO _ as China's leaders must
hope _ or be ruined by it, as Benjamin Franklin surely would have
wished.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the signs are good that China will change for the
better. But whatever the answer, this is a momentous agreement that
will vastly improve its economic landscape, even if the government
carries out only half of its promises.
</P>
<P>
   The liberalizations that China has offered are sweeping, and the
main ones begin on the date of accession, possibly early next year,
not far in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Not all will welcome the changes. In particular, China's poor
farmers, most of whom eke a living from tiny plots, now face
competition from America's efficient agri-business.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial state companies will no longer be able to hide behind
high tariffs and other barriers. State trading companies will no
longer have a lock on imports. The telecoms industry will be thrown
open to foreigners. Foreign banks, at present constrained in what
they can do and where they can go, will be freed.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the state sector, that bastion of the Communist
Party's power, will everywhere be undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth should China's leaders have signed up to such an
undermining? One answer is that many of them have not.
</P>
<P>
   This is a victory for the ``reformers'': Jiang, who seems to
think that the kudos gained abroad by taking China into the WTO
will soon rub off on him at home, and Zhu, who believes more
strongly in membership on its own merits.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, however, is exactly a free-market liberal. They seem
rather to have been swayed by two main arguments. One is that WTO
membership will go a long way to securing for China the place at
the high table of nations that most Chinese believe is theirs by
right.
</P>
<P>
   The other, more immediately practical, argument is that China
will benefit in terms of new jobs and fresh flows of foreign
investment in a reinvigorated economy.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, of course, the Communist Party has made a calculation
about how best to stay in power. Delivering prosperity, party
members acknowledge, is now the touchstone of its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Of late, ideas about how to do it have been few, while the
problems of unemployment and a bankrupt state sector have mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the WTO is a gamble. It is a gamble that may not pay
off. The Communist Party is used to being above the law. In the
WTO, it will have to cede sovereignty _ upwards, to a rules-based,
supranational body, downwards to individual consumers and private
companies at the expense of the state-industrial complex, the
party's main base.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that WTO membership requires a strengthened rule
of law, so an emboldened judiciary might one day be able to
challenge party decisions more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The party will, in turn, need to make new demands of its
subjects even as it loses its economic grip over them. In
particular, new sources of tax revenue will be needed to pay for
cleaning up the mess of state industries. And in time extra taxes
will be needed to pay for the social-welfare provisions whose
absence, already felt, will become more noticeable as the economy
adjusts under WTO prodding.
</P>
<P>
   Such new taxes may lead to calls for better representation,
especially if the press grows bolder.
</P>
<P>
   China's membership of the WTO, it is not fanciful to argue, has
the potential to change the dynamics of a political system that
every day looks more out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
   A belief in eventual and benign political change certainly
accounted for some of the elation among America's trade negotiators
this week. They also believed they had steered Chinese-American
relations well away from the rocks that have so damaged relations
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Both hopes may in the end be dashed. A trade deal will solve
many contentious issues _ market access for the Americans, the
annual congressional hurdle of normal trading status for the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   It will raise many fresh rows, however, as the deal is put into
practice. It would be a mistake, too, to assume that a more benign
political regime is assured as China fits into the world order.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese equate economic growth with national power. Growth
allows China to build up its armed forces, and so to project itself
as a regional power _ a point Jiang is no doubt making to his
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Greater prosperity, in other words, may sharpen Chinese
chauvinism, not temper it. China already knows it has scored a
victory over Taiwan (which will follow the mainland into the WTO).
</P>
<P>
   To meet the WTO's rules, the Taiwanese will have to dismantle
many of the obstacles to trade they have erected to deflect Chinese
influence over their fate. Chinese bullying will become easier.
</P>
<P>
   It is far too early, in other words, for anyone to believe that
America and China are somehow ``strategic partners'' again. For
decades to come, China will be bent on strategic rivalry, and
relations between the two countries should be built on that
assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, even so, to bring China inside the world trading
order, at a time when it is showing a genuine commitment to
profound economic change, than to leave it out in the cold, nursing
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance offered and, wisely, the United States has
seized it. &QL;

<P>
   In the language of international politics, few words are quite
as dirty as appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   It smacks of cowardice, wishful thinking and prevarication,
coupled with a naive belief that aggressors, once appeased, will go
away content, rather than returning for more and more.
</P>
<P>
   This was the lesson of the 1930s, and especially of the Munich
agreement in 1938, when Hitler was ``appeased'' with the
Sudetenland only to turn round and gobble up half Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So when anyone nowadays admits to appeasement, as Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, did this week, it is worth taking note.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of Annan's mea culpa was the publication of his
report on the Serb massacre of some 7,000 Bosnian Muslims in
Srebrenica, in Bosnia, in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. had declared Srebrenica a ``safe area,'' but this _ in
the words of the prosecutor at the war-crimes tribunal for former
Yugoslavia _ is what happened: ``thousands of men (were) buried and
executed in mass graves, hundreds of men buried alive, men and
women mutilated and slaughtered, children killed before their
mothers' eyes, a grandfather forced to eat the liver of his own
grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   Well might he speak of ``scenes from hell, written on the
darkest pages of human history.'' Annan, who was in charge of U.N.
peacekeeping at the time, is evidently no less shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever,'' he
says, and he admits that the U.N. made terrible mistakes, including
negotiations with Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, the Serbs' leaders, which at times ``amounted to
appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the lessons he draws is that ethnic cleansing ``must be
met decisively with all necessary means and with the political will
to carry the policy through to its logical conclusion.'' It is, he
points out, a lesson that has had to be drawn twice in the Balkans
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia and in Kosovo, the international community tried to
reach a negotiated settlement with an unscrupulous and murderous
regime. In both instances it required the use of force to bring to
a halt the planned and systematic killing and expulsion of
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's conclusion, however, is but part of a broader maxim that
he might have suggested should be adopted with all such aggressors,
and in all circumstances, not merely when they are bent on ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   It is this: that an early failure to warn aggressors clearly of
the consequences of their actions will almost inevitably either
allow them to get away with their aggression, or lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity _ which is usually the handmaiden of indecision and
lack of will _ may indeed be just as dangerous as appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   This, alas, is the lesson not just of the 1990s, but of the 20th
century. In addition to the action in Bosnia and Kosovo, at least
five wars this century _ the two world wars, the Korean War, the
Falkands War and the Gulf War _ might all have been avoided had the
ultimate victors made it plain from the outset that they were
willing to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in each case (except perhaps the First World War), the
early message given was that no armed resistance would be offered.
That message was also given, accurately, on other occasions (to
China over Tibet, for instance, and Indonesia over East Timor),
with dire results.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the most successful unfought war of the
century, the Cold War, was notable for the absence of any ambiguity
about the West's readiness to take on its adversary.
</P>
<P>
   The West may have learned some lessons: the European Union is
now preparing to set up a rapid-reaction corps. Yet, as Annan
argues, such a force will be useless if aggressors do not believe
it will be used, and their belief will only be strengthened if the
West does not, from the outset, show that it has the will to fight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest tasks for western politicians in the
post-Cold-War world is to persuade public opinion that the surest
way to avoid more wars is, paradoxically, to display an unwavering
readiness to fight them. &QL;

<P>
   It is an irony worth pondering that, a couple of weeks before
the World Trade Organization meets in Seattle, the entire child
population of America is enslaved by a Japanese fad.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartfelt complaint of globalization's critics is that
the process leads inexorably to the triumph of American pop
culture. The French believe this so strongly that they have
repeatedly threatened to scupper trade talks unless ``cultural''
goods are exempted.
</P>
<P>
   The world's nongovernmental organizations believe it so strongly
that a collection of them have placed a series of huge
advertisements in the New York Times complaining about the
McDonaldization of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But any trade negotiator who feels tempted to agree should take
the precaution of consulting a ten-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' _ parents, note that threatening
adjective _ raked in over $50 million over its opening weekend; and
when a Los Angeles radio station announced a contest for free
tickets, 70,000 calls a minute overwhelmed its switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   A television series based on the Japanese pocket monsters is the
most popular children's program in the country. More than 50
million Pokemon game cards have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The five top-selling video games are all Pokemon-themed.
Pokemon.com is the most popular Web site for children of 12 and
under, and eBay, an Internet auction house, is doing a roaring
business in rare Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not far behind the Japanese in the race to
seduce America's children. The literary sensation of the summer was
J.K. Rowling's trilogy about Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is so lathered up about the child wizard that all the
town's leading directors, from Steven Spielberg to Barry Levinson,
are squabbling over the rights to direct the film and Time Warner,
the studio that owns the rights to the books, is muttering about a
billion-dollar franchise, with sequels, television shows, cartoon
spin-offs, theme-park rides, interactive games and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   And for younger children yet another British product, the
Teletubbies, is almost as popular as that quintessentially American
program, ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   This triple invasion not only disproves the idea that Americans
have a monopoly of popular culture. It also disproves the idea that
non-Americans have a monopoly of silly complaints about the evils
of popular culture, particularly the foreign-made variety.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell, a televangelist, played on a widespread American
suspicion that the British favor homosexuals when he ``outed'' one
of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, on the ground that he carries a
handbag.
</P>
<P>
   Other evangelists have called for the Harry Potter books to be
banned for promoting superstition and witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine calls Pokemon a ``pestilential Ponzi scheme'' that
encourages acquisitiveness and aggression. It also portrays its
inventor as a Japanese misfit who obsessively collected beetles as
a child.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek asks ``Is Pokemon evil?'' (though, to be fair, it
answers ``probably not'').
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego law firm has filed a class-action suit against the
manufacturer of Pokemon cards on the ground that they promote
illegal gambling; and a Colorado preacher required children in his
congregation to watch as he torched Pokemon cards and chopped up a
Pokemon toy with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the anti-globalist growl is that global
companies are marketing fads to children with a ruthlessness that
verges on the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro is indeed churning out licensed toys and collectibles.
Burger King is giving away 57 varieties of Pokemon in a $22 million
promotion. The Pokemon television show functions as a relentless
advertisement for a cavalcade of products.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in the fad for every age. Toys pull in young
children, who then move on to cards and other collectibles before
finally graduating to Nintendo's video games. And there is more to
come: a hundred more Pokemon on their way from Japan to add to the
151 that have already arrived on America's shores. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the conclusions that anti-globalists draw from this
evidence of ruthlessness are mistaken. They are wrong to argue that
everything is being reduced to marketing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder bins of the world's toyshops are full of brilliant
ideas that were dreamed up by marketing departments only to be
forcefully rejected by children. And the people behind the latest
fads sweeping through young America are mavericks, not cynical
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling is a publicity-shy divorcee who wrote her first
Harry Potter book when she was on the dole.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Tajiri, the man behind Pokemon, persisted with his idea
even when Nintendo told him that technology was passing it by. He
then persisted with it again when Nintendo America told him that
role-playing games were not popular with the local children, and
when a bizarre incident, in which 700 Japanese children had fits
while watching a Pokemon television program, put the idea of
exporting the craze under a cloud. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM; STORY CAN STAND HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO
1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalists are also wrong when they argue that
conglomerates inevitably homogenize the ideas that they choose to
hoover up. Some of the Pokemon have certainly had their names
westernized: Zenigame, a turtle who squirts water, has became
Squirtle, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the little monsters still teach distinctively Japanese
values about the importance of team-building and performing your
duties. The only way to succeed at the game is to cooperate with
others _ and the easiest way to fail is to neglect to care for your
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in Hollywood about setting the filmed
version of Harry Potter in an American school, Hogwarts High,
complete with cheerleaders and a blonde girlfriend. But the moguls
soon decided that Britishness is part of the book's charm.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, played by a British actor, will still attend a
1,000-year-old school with crenellated towers and a Latin motto.
Hermione will not change her name to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon will soon be history; with luck, the sickeningly
cute Teletubbies will be history even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of children will find a new craze to fill
their time and soak up their parents' money. But why so many
cultural protectionists assume that the craze will be dreamed up by
some faceless American corporation rather than by a Japanese
bug-collector or a British welfare mother is getting more
mysterious by the day. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A San Diego law firm has filed a class-action suit against the
manufacturer of Pokemon cards on the ground that they promote
illegal gambling; and a Colorado preacher required children in his
congregation to watch as he torched Pokemon cards and chopped up a
Pokemon toy with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the anti-globalist growl is that global
companies are marketing fads to children with a ruthlessness that
verges on the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro is indeed churning out licensed toys and collectibles.
Burger King is giving away 57 varieties of Pokemon in a $22 million
promotion. The Pokemon television show functions as a relentless
advertisement for a cavalcade of products.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in the fad for every age. Toys pull in young
children, who then move on to cards and other collectibles before
finally graduating to Nintendo's video games. And there is more to
come: a hundred more Pokemon on their way from Japan to add to the
151 that have already arrived on America's shores. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the conclusions that anti-globalists draw from this
evidence of ruthlessness are mistaken. They are wrong to argue that
everything is being reduced to marketing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder bins of the world's toyshops are full of brilliant
ideas that were dreamed up by marketing departments only to be
forcefully rejected by children. And the people behind the latest
fads sweeping through young America are mavericks, not cynical
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling is a publicity-shy divorcee who wrote her first
Harry Potter book when she was on the dole.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Tajiri, the man behind Pokemon, persisted with his idea
even when Nintendo told him that technology was passing it by. He
then persisted with it again when Nintendo America told him that
role-playing games were not popular with the local children, and
when a bizarre incident, in which 700 Japanese children had fits
while watching a Pokemon television program, put the idea of
exporting the craze under a cloud. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM; STORY CAN STAND HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO
1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-globalists are also wrong when they argue that
conglomerates inevitably homogenize the ideas that they choose to
hoover up. Some of the Pokemon have certainly had their names
westernized: Zenigame, a turtle who squirts water, has became
Squirtle, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But the little monsters still teach distinctively Japanese
values about the importance of team-building and performing your
duties. The only way to succeed at the game is to cooperate with
others _ and the easiest way to fail is to neglect to care for your
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk in Hollywood about setting the filmed
version of Harry Potter in an American school, Hogwarts High,
complete with cheerleaders and a blonde girlfriend. But the moguls
soon decided that Britishness is part of the book's charm.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, played by a British actor, will still attend a
1,000-year-old school with crenellated towers and a Latin motto.
Hermione will not change her name to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon will soon be history; with luck, the sickeningly
cute Teletubbies will be history even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of children will find a new craze to fill
their time and soak up their parents' money. But why so many
cultural protectionists assume that the craze will be dreamed up by
some faceless American corporation rather than by a Japanese
bug-collector or a British welfare mother is getting more
mysterious by the day. &QL;

<P>
   The cookie-selling season is in full swing for America's 3.5
million Girl Scouts; troops up and down the country are setting up
stalls on street corners to raise money for good causes.
</P>
<P>
   The cookie-baking stereotype is one America holds dear, but the
organization itself would dearly love to shed it. At the Girl
Scouts' tri-annual conference held recently in Kansas City, they
accordingly launched a campaign to update their image.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, oatmeal-and-raisin; hello, girl power!
</P>
<P>
   A recent Harris poll reveals that two-thirds of America's
professional women have been Girl Scouts, including the singer
Natalie Merchant, the broadcast journalist Judy Woodruff, and Susan
Taylor, the editor-in-chief of Essence magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Most agreed that their time in a troop had improved their
ability to work with others, make friends and develop moral values.
</P>
<P>
   But although membership of the Girl Scouts is at its highest for
20 years and is still growing _ by 1.8 percent last year _ adult
leaders are proving hard to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   So Girl Scouts USA is putting out a series of public-service
announcements on radio and television, presented by such famous
former scouts as Cathy Rigby and Jessye Norman, to encourage older
women to act as mentors to younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   There remains an image problem: not only of cookies, but of
unrelenting camping and crafts, as well as a perception of
WASPishness.
</P>
<P>
   The association's leader, Marsha Johnson Evans, wants to change
all that. Girl Scouting, she says, is also about maths, sports and
computing, and may well lead on to a career in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As for the racial mix, Girl Scouts already closely reflect the
country at large. Figures gathered in September 1998 show that 10
percent of members are black, 5 percent are Latino and 78 percent
are white.
</P>
<P>
   There have been multiracial troops since 1912, when the
organization was first launched in the United States. The Girl
Scouts have also made some grass-roots changes to encourage
``problem'' girls to join.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Girl Scouts Beyond Bars'' project, first set up in 1992
in a women's penitentiary in Baltimore, daughters of women
prisoners are invited to join troops of Girl Scouts specifically
created for them.
</P>
<P>
   Similar troops are now attached to 20 prisons in 13 states.
Mothers on remand _ many themselves very young _ are encouraged to
join in the troop activities alongside their children.
</P>
<P>
   Another special project is the ``Border Program,'' which caters
for daughters of migrants living along the Mexican border (in some
of the worst conditions in the country) and has already enrolled
over 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scouts USA has just signed an agreement with the Texas
Migrant Council to make it easier for daughters of migrant farm
workers to enroll in local scout troops when they move within the
state.
</P>
<P>
   There are troops in homeless shelters and in care centers for
pregnant teenagers, and even juvenile delinquents in special
centers can become Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all this risk-taking, there are still no plans to
join forces with that greatest risk of all, boys. The organization
is resolutely girls-only, and points to numerous studies showing
that girls thrive alongside each other but do less well in mixed
groups. (In Britain, where girls have been able for years to join
the Boy Scouts, most still prefer to be Guides.)
</P>
<P>
   And there are certainly no plans to stop the cookie sales. This
form of fund-raising, says Johnson Evans, is a great teaching tool:
``The girls have to decide on their strategy, and it all takes a
lot of planning.'' Ideal groundwork for running the world. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American elections are five-act mysteries. They
have their longueurs, the occasional laugh or dramatic moment, but
above all, lots of different scenes. They are not, as in other
countries, intense one-acters.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign is already into Act Two. The change can be seen in
the performance of three of the four leading men. Al Gore ended the
first act face-down on stage, the audience hooting with derision.
His speeches had been turgid, his delivery wooden. He looked like
the best supporting actor who would never make top billing.
</P>
<P>
   The task in Act Two is to rebuild the Gore character. This
started last month. Now, he strides on dressed in an olive suit,
grabs the microphone and cracks jokes (``In Congress, the right
hand doesn't know what the extreme right hand is doing'').
</P>
<P>
   He departs from the script to talk to members of the audience.
He describes his home life, his blind aunt and his surprising
background as a Vietnam-era dissident.
</P>
<P>
   This character has added depth and feeling. Admittedly, his
reviews have been lousy. Critics complain that he has been
straining for effect, his voice strident and his timing flat. To
them it is ``Re-enter pursued by a wolf.'' But the audience seems
to like this new character.
</P>
<P>
   Barely noticed, Gore's polling numbers _ the campaign's measure
of applause _ have been inching up. He has narrowed the gap between
himself and the Republicans' George W. Bush and, for the first time
in months, has drawn ahead of fellow Democrat Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's task is to display some of the glitz needed to be a
star, Bush's job is the exact opposite. Everyone knows he can hog
the limelight. Act One showed that. But, at the end, it also
suggested that he is a handsome, likeable dope.
</P>
<P>
   The next act is therefore about giving the juvenile lead some
gravitas. This endeavor _ an uphill struggle, some think _ starts
this week, with a long speech on foreign policy in California.
</P>
<P>
   It has been prepared with hours of patient coaching by the best
drama teachers in America. This time, it is hoped, the actor will
not fluff his lines or forget the names of certain minor players,
as he did at the end of Act One.
</P>
<P>
   Act Two will also see Bush on stage more often. His Texas fan
club has helped him to write an autobiography (``A Charge to
Keep''), published this week. And now he will be seen interacting
with the other characters, arguing with them in set-piece debates.
</P>
<P>
   This will be vital. The aim is to show how he performs as the
tension mounts. So far, the audience has no idea whether or not
this character can stand up to pressure or will go to pieces. In
Act Two, he will start to handle adversity.
</P>
<P>
   For his theatrical foil and understudy, John McCain, the second
act is also beginning. His first was a triumph. Brought on as a
spear-carrier and expected to blend into the scenery, he proved a
smash hit with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain character has been one-dimensional so far. Part
of the audience cheers wildly when he talks of honor and integrity.
But only part. He now has to show that he is more than that stock
figure, the peppery military man, admired for straight talking but
lacking the suppleness of mind to dominate the stage at the end.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the most mysterious of the four leading men: Bill
Bradley. He seems to belong to a different play, one of long,
anguished soliloquies interspersed with occasional knockabout
intermissions with great sports figures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   His performance is unlikely to change all that much, at least
until he joins the rest of the cast in New Hampshire, where Act
Three begins in February _ and the characters start getting killed
off. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American elections are five-act mysteries. They
have their longueurs, the occasional laugh or dramatic moment, but
above all, lots of different scenes. They are not, as in other
countries, intense one-acters.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign is already into Act Two. The change can be seen in
the performance of three of the four leading men. Al Gore ended the
first act face-down on stage, the audience hooting with derision.
His speeches had been turgid, his delivery wooden. He looked like
the best supporting actor who would never make top billing.
</P>
<P>
   The task in Act Two is to rebuild the Gore character. This
started last month. Now, he strides on dressed in an olive suit,
grabs the microphone and cracks jokes (``In Congress, the right
hand doesn't know what the extreme right hand is doing'').
</P>
<P>
   He departs from the script to talk to members of the audience.
He describes his home life, his blind aunt and his surprising
background as a Vietnam-era dissident.
</P>
<P>
   This character has added depth and feeling. Admittedly, his
reviews have been lousy. Critics complain that he has been
straining for effect, his voice strident and his timing flat. To
them it is ``Re-enter pursued by a wolf.'' But the audience seems
to like this new character.
</P>
<P>
   Barely noticed, Gore's polling numbers _ the campaign's measure
of applause _ have been inching up. He has narrowed the gap between
himself and the Republicans' George W. Bush and, for the first time
in months, has drawn ahead of fellow Democrat Bill Bradley in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's task is to display some of the glitz needed to be a
star, Bush's job is the exact opposite. Everyone knows he can hog
the limelight. Act One showed that. But, at the end, it also
suggested that he is a handsome, likeable dope.
</P>
<P>
   The next act is therefore about giving the juvenile lead some
gravitas. This endeavor _ an uphill struggle, some think _ starts
this week, with a long speech on foreign policy in California.
</P>
<P>
   It has been prepared with hours of patient coaching by the best
drama teachers in America. This time, it is hoped, the actor will
not fluff his lines or forget the names of certain minor players,
as he did at the end of Act One.
</P>
<P>
   Act Two will also see Bush on stage more often. His Texas fan
club has helped him to write an autobiography (``A Charge to
Keep''), published this week. And now he will be seen interacting
with the other characters, arguing with them in set-piece debates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was ever any doubt about how little the United Nations
expects from the United States, this week probably ended the
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that has been hashed out by Congress and the White
House to pay nearly $1 billion of the dues owed to the U.N. has
been hailed as a victory for the world's foremost multilateral
organization.
</P>
<P>
   That the world's richest country still owes the U.N. some $600
million, and that the deal includes the sort of constraints no
national government would ever dream of accepting, have barely
registered as footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   The spur for the agreement is the fact that, if America fails to
pay at least $350 million of its back dues and assessments by the
end of this year, it will lose its seat in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation is based on an older bill, passed by the
Senate in 1997, that was put together by two senators, Jesse Helms,
a staunch Republican critic of the U.N., and Joseph Biden, a more
sympathetic Democrat. It authorizes payment of $926 million over
the next three years, subject to a number of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The condition that has long been the main obstacle to the
passage of the bill is one that has little relevance outside
American domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans added a proviso that would cut off any
American money for international organizations that promote
abortion (for the U.N., this amounts to something in the order of
$10 million-15 million).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton had been adamant that he would not
sign a bill with this proviso in it, but his administration, which
took an international knock in October when Congress rejected the
nuclear test ban treaty, has now backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state, let it be known that
she would be a ``lightning rod'' for criticism from any feminist
groups over the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of heroism coincidentally meant that credit for the
deal shifted to her, rather than to Richard Holbrooke, the United
States' ambitious ambassador to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   In another piece of domestic American political maneuvering,
Vice-President Al Gore criticized the abortion decision.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, with their minds on congressional and presidential
primaries, happily assume that the U.N. should be extremely
grateful for getting at least most of the money that was owed to
it. And, indeed, the huge dollop of cash will be useful _
particularly for the poor, small countries that have long had to
pay America's way in peacekeeping, such as Fiji (which is owed $6
million) and Bangladesh ($15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N.'s secretary-general, has cautiously called
the bill ``a positive development.'' But is it really such a good
deal for the U.N.?
</P>
<P>
   Begin with the non-family-planning conditions laid down by
Congress. The other 187 U.N. members must accept the $926 million
as payment in full. From now on America's contribution to the
U.N.'s budget will be reduced from 25 percent of the total to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s budget cannot be increased even in nominal terms
(i.e., it will have to be reduced in real terms). Various U.N.
committees must be wound up at fixed ``sunset'' times. An American
must be installed on the main budget watchdog committee. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these provisions have the laudable aim of continuing the
reform of the U.N.'s management. The U.N., which was hoping for a
small rise next year in its budget (static in dollar terms since
1994), may be a lot leaner than it used to be, but it is still too
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   Annan himself tried to introduce sunset times for committees.
And it probably makes sense for America to be elected to the main
budgeting committees.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the idea that the world's richest country can
unilaterally cancel its debts is something that even America's
closest allies find hard to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States can walk away from its debts, why not
others? Nor, even by paying 25 percent of the total, was America
evidently paying too much.
</P>
<P>
   America accounts for some 30 percent of the world's GDP, twice
as much as Japan, which pays 18 percent of the U.N.'s budget (soon
to rise to 20 percent) and, unlike the United States, has no seat
on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats at most multinational organizations are used to
America strong-arming its partners into agreeing to joint
communiques. But some think that the idea of Congress unilaterally
deciding what happens to a multilateral organization (without even
bothering to go through the formality of letting other countries
vote) marks a new step.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Luck, the author of ``Mixed Messages: American Politics
and International Organization 1919-99'' (Brookings Institution),
concludes that the U.N. might do better by ``being poor but
principled.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO
</ANNOTATION>
1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Various U.N. committees could still refuse to comply with parts
of the Helms-Biden agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week's deal, some U.N. refuseniks had privately
hoped that America would lose its seat in the assembly. Their
argument was that this might force a healthy debate in America on
the issue. But others worried that U.N. obstinacy would merely lead
to something worse coming out of America in return.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's message to the U.N. and, more important, to its
member governments will be a simple one: this is the best deal you
will get. The chances are that most of the governments will go
along.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior diplomats contrast their frustration with America
at the U.N. with the good bilateral relations their governments
have with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it will be those bilateral relations that matter
most. And that, like virtually everything else this week, will show
how weak multilateralism, and the United Nations, really are. &QL;

Vice-President Al Gore criticized the abortion decision.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, with their minds on congressional and presidential
primaries, happily assume that the U.N. should be extremely
grateful for getting at least most of the money that was owed to
it. And, indeed, the huge dollop of cash will be useful _
particularly for the poor, small countries that have long had to
pay America's way in peacekeeping, such as Fiji (which is owed $6
million) and Bangladesh ($15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the U.N.'s secretary-general, has cautiously called
the bill ``a positive development.'' But is it really such a good
deal for the U.N.?
</P>
<P>
   Begin with the non-family-planning conditions laid down by
Congress. The other 187 U.N. members must accept the $926 million
as payment in full. From now on America's contribution to the
U.N.'s budget will be reduced from 25 percent of the total to 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s budget cannot be increased even in nominal terms
(i.e., it will have to be reduced in real terms). Various U.N.
committees must be wound up at fixed ``sunset'' times. An American
must be installed on the main budget watchdog committee. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these provisions have the laudable aim of continuing the
reform of the U.N.'s management. The U.N., which was hoping for a
small rise next year in its budget (static in dollar terms since
1994), may be a lot leaner than it used to be, but it is still too
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   Annan himself tried to introduce sunset times for committees.
And it probably makes sense for America to be elected to the main
budgeting committees.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the idea that the world's richest country can
unilaterally cancel its debts is something that even America's
closest allies find hard to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States can walk away from its debts, why not
others? Nor, even by paying 25 percent of the total, was America
evidently paying too much.
</P>
<P>
   America accounts for some 30 percent of the world's GDP, twice
as much as Japan, which pays 18 percent of the U.N.'s budget (soon
to rise to 20 percent) and, unlike the United States, has no seat
on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats at most multinational organizations are used to
America strong-arming its partners into agreeing to joint
communiques. But some think that the idea of Congress unilaterally
deciding what happens to a multilateral organization (without even
bothering to go through the formality of letting other countries
vote) marks a new step.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Luck, the author of ``Mixed Messages: American Politics
and International Organization 1919-99'' (Brookings Institution),
concludes that the U.N. might do better by ``being poor but
principled.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Various U.N. committees could still refuse to comply with parts
of the Helms-Biden agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week's deal, some U.N. refuseniks had privately
hoped that America would lose its seat in the assembly. Their
argument was that this might force a healthy debate in America on
the issue. But others worried that U.N. obstinacy would merely lead
to something worse coming out of America in return.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's message to the U.N. and, more important, to its
member governments will be a simple one: this is the best deal you
will get. The chances are that most of the governments will go
along.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior diplomats contrast their frustration with America
at the U.N. with the good bilateral relations their governments
have with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it will be those bilateral relations that matter
most. And that, like virtually everything else this week, will show
how weak multilateralism, and the United Nations, really are. &QL;

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABILENE, KANSAS _ Around the corner from the Dwight D.
Eisenhower presidential library in Abilene, Kan., is the Museum of
Independent Telephony.
</P>
<P>
   Its 20,000 visitors a year see a bewildering collection, ranging
from wooden wall phones, ``candlestick'' phones and old pay phones,
to switchboards and a reconstructed operator's lair.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their years, some of the artifacts continue to work as
interactive exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been receiving more than usual interest in recent
years, for Abilene has become a focus for a new American
phenomenon. In this the age of modems, mobiles and voice mail,
Americans are going all gooey over old phones.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient railroad town has arguably become the antique phone
center of America _ the Antique Telephone Collectors Association is
also headquartered in Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   It owes its status partly to the generosity of the Sprint
Corporation, a telecommunications giant which funds the museum
because someone called C.L. Brown founded the company there many
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a big factor in the birth of the old phone market
has been the Internet. It has allowed enthusiasts to link up with
like-minded souls thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too few collectors to form local organizations of
any size, but the Internet has been a wonderful way for people to
connect,'' says Karen Poza, who two years ago joined the ranks of
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collectors are like vultures,'' says Paul Wiltfong of
Lenexa, Kan., a construction worker who has collected some 14,000
items since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Auction Web sites like eBay offer a lively marketplace for the
buying and selling of old phones and switchboards. Many vintage
phones now cost between $500 and $1,000, with a few exceptional
ones running into five figures.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular collectable phones tend to be the ones that
people remember using themselves. For instance, interest in early
20th-century wooden wall phones _ once the most popular models _
has waned because fewer people are now alive who remember using
them.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of older phones that attracts aficionados is their
reliability. Back in the days when the phone company _ not the
consumer _ owned most phones, it was in the company's interest to
provide durable machines that cut down on repair trips.
</P>
<P>
   Many collectors actually use the rotary-dial phones that they
buy. Indeed, many old models are still compatible with current
phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an unfixable phone,'' says Steve
Hilsz who repairs phones and writes troubleshooting guides for
old-phone users.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say that some of the new buyers in the market are people
who have decorated their houses in retro styles and need
``era-appropriate'' phones. Indeed, some upmarket retailers are
already serving this market by reproducing the old-fashioned
designs.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it be before they end up in Abilene? &QL;

<P>
   ABILENE, KANSAS _ Around the corner from the Dwight D.
Eisenhower presidential library in Abilene, Kan., is the Museum of
Independent Telephony.
</P>
<P>
   Its 20,000 visitors a year see a bewildering collection, ranging
from wooden wall phones, ``candlestick'' phones and old pay phones,
to switchboards and a reconstructed operator's lair.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their years, some of the artifacts continue to work as
interactive exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been receiving more than usual interest in recent
years, for Abilene has become a focus for a new American
phenomenon. In this the age of modems, mobiles and voice mail,
Americans are going all gooey over old phones.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient railroad town has arguably become the antique phone
center of America _ the Antique Telephone Collectors Association is
also headquartered in Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   It owes its status partly to the generosity of the Sprint
Corporation, a telecommunications giant which funds the museum
because someone called C.L. Brown founded the company there many
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a big factor in the birth of the old phone market
has been the Internet. It has allowed enthusiasts to link up with
like-minded souls thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too few collectors to form local organizations of
any size, but the Internet has been a wonderful way for people to
connect,'' says Karen Poza, who two years ago joined the ranks of
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collectors are like vultures,'' says Paul Wiltfong of
Lenexa, Kan., a construction worker who has collected some 14,000
items since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Auction Web sites like eBay offer a lively marketplace for the
buying and selling of old phones and switchboards. Many vintage
phones now cost between $500 and $1,000, with a few exceptional
ones running into five figures.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular collectable phones tend to be the ones that
people remember using themselves. For instance, interest in early
20th-century wooden wall phones _ once the most popular models _
has waned because fewer people are now alive who remember using
them.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of older phones that attracts aficionados is their
reliability. Back in the days when the phone company _ not the
consumer _ owned most phones, it was in the company's interest to
provide durable machines that cut down on repair trips.
</P>
<P>
   Many collectors actually use the rotary-dial phones that they
buy. Indeed, many old models are still compatible with current
phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an unfixable phone,'' says Steve
Hilsz who repairs phones and writes troubleshooting guides for
old-phone users.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say that some of the new buyers in the market are people
who have decorated their houses in retro styles and need
``era-appropriate'' phones. Indeed, some upmarket retailers are
already serving this market by reproducing the old-fashioned
designs.
</P>
<P>
   How long will it be before they end up in Abilene? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard not to believe in Jeff Bezos. His gurgling laugh
explodes any suspicion that the story he spins so effortlessly may
be just a little too slick, a little too removed from the
murderously competitive world of Web retailing that Amazon has done
so much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the wild gyrations of Amazon's share price over the
past year caused its founder and chief executive to lose sleep.
Bezos manages to be simultaneously both bouncy and imperturbable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are testing times. Only 16 months ago Amazon sold
nothing but books. Last week the company opened four new ``stores''
_ home improvement, software, video games and presents _ to join
music, electronics, toys, DVD/video, auctions and its ``shop the
Web'' portal, zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it expects to add as many new businesses again.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is placing a huge bet that Amazon can dominate just about
every big category of Web retailing. He expects that before long
Amazon.com will be a ``destination site'' where customers can find
anything they could possibly want and be certain, no matter what
they buy, of impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, he says, will be the ``most customer-centric company in
the world.'' But it is also possible that Amazon is overreaching
itself in an ill-judged rush to become the Wal-Mart of the Web
(Wal-Mart's own online efforts have got off to a slow start).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Bezos take for granted the willingness of Amazon's
investors indefinitely to tolerate the firm's accelerating
operating losses, particularly if, in spite of its relentless
expansion, sales growth continues to slow.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Bezos is a persuasive advocate of the
course he has set _ were he not, Amazon would hardly be worth $25
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon is now in many businesses, he maintains that
they are all essentially similar, and that ``tremendous'' scale
economies can be reaped by ``extending the technology platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon can cut shipping costs by parcelling together different
types of purchase. Expensively developed features, such as Amazon's
proprietary ``one-click'' buying, can be made to work across the
entire range of goods it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bezos, is there any danger of Amazon becoming
a dull generalist. Like a diversified publisher, Amazon can offer
expert advice and information in every category, with the best
editorial teams lured by the promise of valuable share options and
its ability to out-invest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that Amazon is stretching its elastic young
brand too far, Bezos argues that this is to miss the point. Such is
the sophistication of the firm's software that coming to Amazon
will not be like entering the halls of a huge, soulless department
store. It will be more like stopping by at a local shop where your
every taste and preference is known.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat from Wal-Mart when it really gets going on the
Web? Not focused enough, retorts Bezos; online and offline
businesses are just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, compelling though the Bezos vision may be, there are signs
of restlessness in the ranks of generally admiring Wall Street
Internet analysts, five of whom downgraded their rating of the
firm's shares after Amazon's third-quarter results a couple of
weeks ago. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who made his name
last year by setting what seemed an impossibly ambitious
share-price target for the firm, and was promptly proved right.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget was upset by Amazon's apparent unconcern in projecting a
massive increase in future losses without a corresponding
improvement in forecast revenues. Such nonchalance was becoming
``numbingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, investors will tire of postponed
gratification. Blodget worries that Amazon spends more to generate
revenues than he ever thought possible: whatever Bezos says about
synergies, Amazon seems to be facing decreasing returns to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget still supports Amazon's expansion and believes it will
eventually pay off, but he is concerned that investors may not want
to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is not terribly sympathetic, suggesting that only those in
for the long haul should invest. He acknowledges, however, that
Amazon has been amazingly free to spend money almost without limit
_ and that this freedom won't last forever, especially if the firm
continues to burn through capital at a rate of about $250 million a
quarter. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is more worrying is the possibility that Amazon may be
going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many _ most of them, admittedly, rivals _ who think
that Amazon's insatiable appetite will be its undoing. They say the
Web, with its indifference to distance and place, is ideally suited
not to general stores but to ``category killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is eToys, eBay (auctions), CDNow, Outpost (computers
and software), Home Depot, Reel.com (videos) or Garden.com, they
and hundreds of like-minded competitors think specialists
understand their customers better and can provide superior service
and lower prices than a generalist such as Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   By coming together in virtual shopping malls organized by
portals such as Yahoo! and America Online, they argue, they can
also offer web shoppers a greater range of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Christmas will provide some clues as to who is right.
Jupiter Communications, an e-commerce market-research firm, expects
Americans to buy $5 billion worth of products on the Internet in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, when Jupiter predicts that Christmas e-spending will
reach nearly $80 billion, there should be enough business for both
Amazon and the best specialists to thrive. Assuming that Bezos has
not made a hash of things, Amazon may by then even have turned a
profit. &QL;

<P>
   Among them was Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who made his name
last year by setting what seemed an impossibly ambitious
share-price target for the firm, and was promptly proved right.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget was upset by Amazon's apparent unconcern in projecting a
massive increase in future losses without a corresponding
improvement in forecast revenues. Such nonchalance was becoming
``numbingly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he said, investors will tire of postponed
gratification. Blodget worries that Amazon spends more to generate
revenues than he ever thought possible: whatever Bezos says about
synergies, Amazon seems to be facing decreasing returns to scale.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget still supports Amazon's expansion and believes it will
eventually pay off, but he is concerned that investors may not want
to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is not terribly sympathetic, suggesting that only those in
for the long haul should invest. He acknowledges, however, that
Amazon has been amazingly free to spend money almost without limit
_ and that this freedom won't last forever, especially if the firm
continues to burn through capital at a rate of about $250 million a
quarter. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is more worrying is the possibility that Amazon may be
going in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   There are many _ most of them, admittedly, rivals _ who think
that Amazon's insatiable appetite will be its undoing. They say the
Web, with its indifference to distance and place, is ideally suited
not to general stores but to ``category killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is eToys, eBay (auctions), CDNow, Outpost (computers
and software), Home Depot, Reel.com (videos) or Garden.com, they
and hundreds of like-minded competitors think specialists
understand their customers better and can provide superior service
and lower prices than a generalist such as Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   By coming together in virtual shopping malls organized by
portals such as Yahoo! and America Online, they argue, they can
also offer web shoppers a greater range of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Christmas will provide some clues as to who is right.
Jupiter Communications, an e-commerce market-research firm, expects
Americans to buy $5 billion worth of products on the Internet in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, when Jupiter predicts that Christmas e-spending will
reach nearly $80 billion, there should be enough business for both
Amazon and the best specialists to thrive. Assuming that Bezos has
not made a hash of things, Amazon may by then even have turned a
profit. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The mystery of what happened to the Egyptair Boeing
767 which crashed off the U.S. coast two weeks ago may finally be
solved this week, as the tape from the cockpit voice recorder is
painstakingly transcribed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in British and American media has so far blamed
mechanical failure, a struggle between the crew, a bomb, a hijack
and a suicidal crew member _ without any evidence whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationality of the crew and the plane have apparently
encouraged reporters to make irresponsible guesses at what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Also, anonymous sources from one U.S. agency have repeatedly
leaked their views to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the leaks may be coming from the FBI, which would take
over the investigation if there was a strong presumption of
criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a number
of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for an
expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

   The change seemed to be a small one. British people buying the

</P>
<P>
   The result was uproar last week: for British users, accustomed
to having an English name for something, this was seen as part of a
creeping _ or possibly rampant _ change worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, British spellings such as ``colour'' and
``favour'' are being overwhelmed by the American versions _ color,
favor and so on.

   Millionaire fever has swept America. And we are not talking

   LONDON _ Two hundred women being treated for infertility have
had their embryos screened for genetic defects, and 20 children
have already been born in what critics warn could be the first step
towards ``designer'' babies.

   The controversial technique, called pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis, involves selecting embryos that are then checked for
genetic defects. Only those embryos free of defects are replanted
in the womb.

   Pro-life groups say scientists are ``meddling in human
evolution'' and that the technique could be used to select
qualities such as intelligence and sporting prowess. They fear
advances in the technique will trigger growing demands from parents
seeking the ``perfect'' child. &QL;

<P>
   It is hard not to believe in Jeff Bezos. His gurgling laugh
explodes any suspicion that the story he spins so effortlessly may
be just a little too slick, a little too removed from the
murderously competitive world of Web retailing that Amazon has done
so much to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the wild gyrations of Amazon's share price over the
past year caused its founder and chief executive to lose sleep.
Bezos manages to be simultaneously both bouncy and imperturbable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are testing times. Only 16 months ago Amazon sold
nothing but books. Last week the company opened four new ``stores''
_ home improvement, software, video games and presents _ to join
music, electronics, toys, DVD/video, auctions and its ``shop the
Web'' portal, zShops.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, it expects to add as many new businesses again.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos is placing a huge bet that Amazon can dominate just about
every big category of Web retailing. He expects that before long
Amazon.com will be a ``destination site'' where customers can find
anything they could possibly want and be certain, no matter what
they buy, of impeccable service.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, he says, will be the ``most customer-centric company in
the world.'' But it is also possible that Amazon is overreaching
itself in an ill-judged rush to become the Wal-Mart of the Web
(Wal-Mart's own online efforts have got off to a slow start).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Bezos take for granted the willingness of Amazon's
investors indefinitely to tolerate the firm's accelerating
operating losses, particularly if, in spite of its relentless
expansion, sales growth continues to slow.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Bezos is a persuasive advocate of the
course he has set _ were he not, Amazon would hardly be worth $25
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amazon is now in many businesses, he maintains that
they are all essentially similar, and that ``tremendous'' scale
economies can be reaped by ``extending the technology platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon can cut shipping costs by parcelling together different
types of purchase. Expensively developed features, such as Amazon's
proprietary ``one-click'' buying, can be made to work across the
entire range of goods it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bezos, is there any danger of Amazon becoming
a dull generalist. Like a diversified publisher, Amazon can offer
expert advice and information in every category, with the best
editorial teams lured by the promise of valuable share options and
its ability to out-invest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As for the worry that Amazon is stretching its elastic young
brand too far, Bezos argues that this is to miss the point. Such is
the sophistication of the firm's software that coming to Amazon
will not be like entering the halls of a huge, soulless department
store. It will be more like stopping by at a local shop where your
every taste and preference is known.
</P>
<P>
   And the threat from Wal-Mart when it really gets going on the
Web? Not focused enough, retorts Bezos; online and offline
businesses are just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, compelling though the Bezos vision may be, there are signs
of restlessness in the ranks of generally admiring Wall Street
Internet analysts, five of whom downgraded their rating of the
firm's shares after Amazon's third-quarter results a couple of
weeks ago. &QL;

walking vacation in Patagonia fails to excite you, perhaps it is
time to start planning a long weekend in space.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years this may mean a day trip to low earth orbit
or, by 2017, at a vacation resort resembling a cross between a
theme park and a cruise ship where space tourists can stay for as
long as they like. &QL;

   Millionaire fever has swept America. And we are not talking
about the booming economy or the tide of winnings from stock
trading on Wall Street. No, this is all about a TV game show that
started in Britain and is now commanding the airwaves on this side
of the water _ ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ABC network began airing its own version of the ITV
quiz program in the summer, it has seen its ratings explode. &QL;

   LONDON _ Two hundred women being treated for infertility have
had their embryos screened for genetic defects, and 20 children
have already been born in what critics warn could be the first step
towards ``designer'' babies.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial technique, called pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis, involves selecting embryos that are then checked for
genetic defects. Only those embryos free of defects are replanted
in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-life groups say scientists are ``meddling in human
evolution'' and that the technique could be used to select
qualities such as intelligence and sporting prowess. They fear
advances in the technique will trigger growing demands from parents
seeking the ``perfect'' child. &QL;

<P>
   The change seemed to be a small one. British people buying the
new version of Apple Computer's operating system, OS9, noticed the
icon for deleting files wasn't called the Wastebasket anymore. It
was called the Trash.
</P>
<P>
   The result was uproar last week: for British users, accustomed
to having an English name for something, this was seen as part of a
creeping _ or possibly rampant _ change worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some, describing it as a ``slap in the face,'' have said they
will not buy the new version until Apple relents.
</P>
<P>
   That looks unlikely _ and not just on the computer front. Around
the world, British spellings such as ``colour'' and ``favour'' are
being overwhelmed by the American versions _ color, favor and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   American culture, exported in TV series, the Internet and the
language of computers, is overwhelming ``British English'' so fast
that it may not be a question of if, but when, our spellings and
colloquial uses are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   John Simpson is familiar with the frustrations of the American
invasion of British English. ``Every time I spell-check a document,
the computer's dictionary seems to assume that I'm in America, and
I have to override it and put in the British spelling.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a common enough complaint; but for Simpson it has a
particular resonance. He is the chief editor of the Oxford English
Dictionaries, where he has worked for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing is that there's actually only a small number of
words which are different, such as travelling, where Americans drop
the second `l,' or catalogue, where they drop the `ue,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the differences were introduced consciously in 1828 by
Noah Webster, who produced the first American dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not long after the War of Independence, and he wanted
to show that American English was different from British English _
that it had thrown off the overlordship of Britain. He was very
keen for American English to be completely respelt. It was a
political act.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of American culture has gone far beyond what even
Webster might have imagined. The Independent's foreign
correspondents, in big cities around the world, confirmed that in
almost every case the form of English used is the American one.
</P>
<P>
   There have even been signs of that spread reaching the UK: a
couple of years ago the MP Diane Abbott was surprised to find local
children who thought the emergency number was 911 _ because ``call
911'' is what characters in American dramas yell.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Millum, director of development for the National
Association for the Teaching of English, thinks it is important to
distinguish between spelling _ which he thinks is comparatively
unimportant _ and colloquialism, which does matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we spell the word `colour' or `color' is really only
interesting to linguists and pedants like myself. But quirks, like
the choice between `Trash' or `Wastebasket,' add to the richness of
a language.
</P>
<P>
   ```Wastebasket' has meanings for us which differ from `Trash' or
`Trashcan.' And we say pavement where Americans say sidewalk _ but
they call the road the pavement. It can make a difference just in
terms of instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple remains steadfast. Peter Lowe, head of product marketing,
insisted that calling it ``Trash'' will make production of new
versions cheaper and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Jary, editor-in-chief of Macworld UK magazine, is
unconvinced: ``Apple changes the paper to A4 from the American
sizes _ but they couldn't change this? It doesn't ring true.'' &QL;

TURKEY INSTANT REPLAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 26 or later) &HT;     By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many a cook, you roasted extra turkey Thursday so you could
relax and end up with plenty of leftover meat stashed in the fridge
to score an instant replay. But this time around, plan to put this
most valuable player in a different guise _ such as pasta, salads,
sandwiches, casseroles or chili.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of inspired easy-to-make options offered in
today's collection _ or you can use the recipes as a base to create
your own concoctions with whatever you have handy. You might even
toss some cooked turkey into favorite recipes like quiches,
toastadas, quesadillas, macaroni and cheese, pizza and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey pairs well with a wide variety of flavors, ingredients
and herbs and spices _ from curry, basil and cumin to chili powder,
cilantro, tomatoes, cheeses, and more. You may need an extra dose
of seasonings since turkey tends to be bland.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid overcooking the prepared meat, add it to chilis,
pastas, soups and such the last few minutes of the cooking time. Or
turn it into an interesting cold salad or sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that refrigerated leftover turkey should be used
within two to three days. Otherwise freeze it (well wrapped) and
use within a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   These turkey replays should score with family and friends. And
if you run out of turkey, give these creations a try during the
hectic holiday season with cooked store-bought chicken. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY MELTS WITH CHEDDAR AND CHUTNEY
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their debut in the '70s, tuna melts have been a
favorite luncheon sandwich. The concept soars to delicious
post-Thanksgiving heights, as leftover turkey replaces the tuna
fish and teams compatibly with sweet chutney and sharp Cheddar
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cooked diced turkey
</P>
<P>
   1 rib celery, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, trimmed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chutney
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 sandwich-sized English muffins, split and lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   Sliced tomatoes (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Sprouts (optional)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine turkey, celery, green onions, cilantro and
chutney. Mix in mayonnaise to bind and season to taste with salt.
Store in refrigerator until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble melts, arrange English muffin halves on a baking
sheet and top with sliced tomatoes, turkey mixture, a sprinkling of
sprouts and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In preheated broiler, broil a few inches from heat until hot and
bubbling, about 3 to 4 minutes. Serve at once. Makes 8 open-face
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   TUSCAN PUMPKIN, WHITE BEAN AND TURKEY SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin and white bean soup is a favorite cold-weather
combination and the post-Thanksgiving addition of leftover roast
turkey makes this Americanized version hearty enough to be a main
course.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 ribs celery, finely chopped
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>

   1 1/2 cups cooked coarsely chopped turkey
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Grated Parmesan cheese for garnishing
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a soup pot. Add
onion, celery and garlic. Saute, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes,
until vegetables are very soft and just beginning to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and pumpkin, stirring until smooth. Simmer 15 minutes.
Stir in beans and turkey; season with salt and pepper. Continue
simmering until heated through, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve soup hot and drizzle a teaspoon or so of olive oil over
top of each portion and sprinkle with cheese. Makes 6 to 8
servings.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY TORTILLA PIZZAS
</P>

heat. Add pepper strips and onion, saute until softened, 5 to 7
minutes. Add turkey mixture and saute another 2 minutes. Remove
from heat and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble pizzas, brush tortillas lightly on one side with
remaining oil. Place tortillas, oil-side up, on baking sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven about 5 minutes until just
beginning to crisp.
</P>

   Remove tortillas from oven and sprinkle each with some cheese to
cover surface lightly all over. Divide turkey-vegetable mixture
evenly among pizzas. Sprinkle top of each with some diced tomatoes
and cilantro.

<P>
   The change seemed to be a small one. British people buying the
new version of Apple Computer's operating system, OS9, noticed the
icon for deleting files wasn't called the Wastebasket anymore. It
was called the Trash.
</P>
<P>
   The result was uproar last week: for British users, accustomed
to having an English name for something, this was seen as part of a
creeping _ or possibly rampant _ change worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some, describing it as a ``slap in the face,'' have said they
will not buy the new version until Apple relents.
</P>
<P>
   That looks unlikely _ and not just on the computer front. Around
the world, British spellings such as ``colour'' and ``favour'' are
being overwhelmed by the American versions _ color, favor and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   American culture, exported in TV series, the Internet and the
language of computers, is overwhelming ``British English'' so fast
that it may not be a question of if, but when, our spellings and
colloquial uses are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   John Simpson is familiar with the frustrations of the American
invasion of British English. ``Every time I spell-check a document,
the computer's dictionary seems to assume that I'm in America, and
I have to override it and put in the British spelling.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a common enough complaint; but for Simpson it has a
particular resonance. He is the chief editor of the Oxford English
Dictionaries, where he has worked for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing is that there's actually only a small number of
words which are different, such as travelling, where Americans drop
the second `l,' or catalogue, where they drop the `ue,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the differences were introduced consciously in 1828 by
Noah Webster, who produced the first American dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not long after the War of Independence, and he wanted
to show that American English was different from British English _
that it had thrown off the overlordship of Britain. He was very
keen for American English to be completely respelt. It was a
political act.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of American culture has gone far beyond what even
Webster might have imagined. The Independent's foreign
correspondents, in big cities around the world, confirmed that in
almost every case the form of English used is the American one.
</P>
<P>
   There have even been signs of that spread reaching the UK: a
couple of years ago the MP Diane Abbott was surprised to find local
children who thought the emergency number was 911 _ because ``call
911'' is what characters in American dramas yell.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Millum, director of development for the National
Association for the Teaching of English, thinks it is important to
distinguish between spelling _ which he thinks is comparatively
unimportant _ and colloquialism, which does matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we spell the word `colour' or `color' is really only
interesting to linguists and pedants like myself. But quirks, like
the choice between `Trash' or `Wastebasket,' add to the richness of
a language.
</P>
<P>
   ```Wastebasket' has meanings for us which differ from `Trash' or
`Trashcan.' And we say pavement where Americans say sidewalk _ but
they call the road the pavement. It can make a difference just in
terms of instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple remains steadfast. Peter Lowe, head of product marketing,
insisted that calling it ``Trash'' will make production of new
versions cheaper and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Jary, editor-in-chief of Macworld UK magazine, is
unconvinced: ``Apple changes the paper to A4 from the American
sizes _ but they couldn't change this? It doesn't ring true.'' &QL;

<P>
   Talking Doorknobs, ingestible computers and telephones that do
not ring if there is nobody to answer them are the shape of new
technology in the next 10 years, according to an Internet guru.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Laboratory, made his predictions when
addressing an audience in London Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``You may wonder about how computing could possibly
affect something like a doorknob. But if you think about it, an
intelligent doorknob would be a really useful thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not need keys: it could identify you by your
fingerprints, and perhaps confirm your identity by asking a
question, `What's your mother's maiden name?' for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The smart doorknob could also accept parcel deliveries _ and
perhaps sign digitally for them; ``and maybe it could let the dog
out, and then let it back in while keeping out the other nine dogs
following it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology required to do that is already sufficiently
miniaturized, he said, and could pervade our world. ``We will have
thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of embedded chips around us,
all intercommunicating,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Negroponte, author of the book ``Being Digital,''
espouses the view that anything that can be expressed as computer
``bits'' _ including words, images and sound _ will eventually be
transmitted in that form across the world, speeding deals and
cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   As computers shrink and become pervasive over the next decade,
the sort of information they can access will grow, he forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a really futuristic product for 10 years hence,
you'll have computers that you eat, one per day. (They) will
contain devices and sensors which will record all your anatomical
measurements, what's going on inside you, and relay them to a black
box that you wear on your belt. If it passes through you, no
problem _ swallow another.'' Such systems would be invaluable to
doctors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Negroponte also foresees telephone handsets becoming
smarter. ``Phones should be built smart enough to know if there's
nobody there. And if there is someone there, they should be able to
answer them, like a good butler, and find out who is calling and
why, and only then decide whether to get our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are still some giant steps to be made for the average
user of computers, he admitted. ``Who would have believed, ten
years ago, that big segments of the population would spend between
$1,600 and $3,200 on their own computers _ and that those machines
would reduce people to tears once or twice a week?'' &QL;

<P>
   If the prospect of two weeks in Marbella bores you and even a
walking vacation in Patagonia fails to excite you, perhaps it is
time to start planning a long weekend in space.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years this may mean a day trip to low earth orbit
or, by 2017, at a vacation resort resembling a cross between a
theme park and a cruise ship where space tourists can stay for as
long as they like.
</P>
<P>
   These and other such plans for vacation 200 miles above the
Earth's surface were unveiled this week at the World Travel Market,
the tourism trade show in west London.
</P>
<P>
   Guests must travel lightly and be prepared for space sickness,
but highlights include the opportunity for weightless sex in one of
the honeymoon suites and some awe-inspiring vacation snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolff, vice-president of Wimberly Allison Tong &AMP; Goo
(WAT&AMP;G), a U.S. architectural firm specializing in leisure resorts
which has designed a 100-room orbiting hotel, said: ``An increasing
number of people are seeking some kind of transformative
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for more than a vacation on the beach and
want something more to show for it than just a tan. And what could
be a more life-transforming experience than seeing our planet from
200 miles up?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff is confident that there is a market for space tourism and,
in the U.S. at least, it is an idea that appears to have taken off.
</P>
<P>
   More than 93,000 people have put their name down on PanAm's
waiting list for flights to the moon while 15 million visitors went
to land-based space attractions last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,500 North Americans, 34 percent said they would
be interested in a two-week trip aboard a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   WAT&AMP;G's orbiting resort would use recycled external fuel tanks
salvaged from future space shuttle launches. There will be a
viewing deck on board with computer images to help guests identify
which parts of the Earth they are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Guests will be served food grown hydroponically on board and can
keep fit by playing ball games in zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like developing a new, vast and wonderful frontier,''
Wolff said. ``But the point will be to strike a balance between
creating an out-of-this-world experience and providing some
creature comforts that travellers have come to expect from other
destination resorts.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ Two hundred women being treated for infertility have
had their embryos screened for genetic defects, and 20 children
have already been born in what critics warn could be the first step
towards designer babies.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were revealed Monday by the Human Fertilization and
Embryology Authority in a consultation document seeking the
public's views on whether genetic screening of embryos should be
extended.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial technique, called pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis, involves selecting embryos that are then checked for
genetic defects. Only those embryos free of defects are replanted
in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   All the 200 women on whom the technique has so far been tried
had serious genetic disorders in their families, including cystic
fibrosis, Huntington's chorea and Taysach's disease, which they
wished to avoid passing on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   However, pro-life groups say scientists are ``meddling in human
evolution'' and that the technique could be used to select
qualities such as intelligence and sporting prowess.
</P>
<P>
   They fear advances in the technique will trigger growing demands
from parents seeking the ``perfect'' child.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment of Reproductive Ethics, said:
``This is designing. You are saying we don't like this defect or
that defect. It is a slippery slope. Even in pre-natal screening
what used to be considered a minor defect like a harelip is now a
reason for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we have a dyslexia gene that people will say they don't
want? If you offer people choices they will inevitably say they
want something better.''
</P>
<P>
   The embryology authority banned sex selection for social reasons
in 1993 but allowed it for medical reasons in couples with
sex-linked diseases such as hemophilia and Duchenne's muscular
dystrophy, which occur only in boys.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is seeking views on how tightly the use of the technique
should be regulated for detecting other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   The authority said: ``This isn't about the creation of designer
babies but it is about helping families avoid passing on serious
genetic diseases to their children. They would not be allowed to
select embryos for social, physical or psychological
characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents who had had repeated miscarriages or seen previous
children die, screening offered hope but it had so far been used in
only a handful of fatal disorders caused by single genes.
</P>
<P>
   The consultation paper says demand could grow from couples
wanting to test for common disorders, but selecting embryos for
physical characteristics or intelligence is ``unlikely to be a
realistic possibility'' because their genetic basis is not
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lord Winston, head of the IVF clinic at Hammersmith
Hospital, west London, which pioneered pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis and is one of only four in Britain permitted by the
embryology authority to do it, said: ``The technique has been
widely hyped. It is revolutionary but it is of limited value
although in families where it has value it should be used.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected claims that it could be the start of a slippery
slope towards the quality control of children. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The mystery of what happened to the Egyptair Boeing
767 which crashed off the U.S. coast two weeks ago may finally be
solved this week, as the tape from the cockpit voice recorder is
painstakingly transcribed and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in British and American media has so far blamed
mechanical failure, a struggle between the crew, a bomb, a hijack
and a suicidal crew member, without any evidence whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators from America's National Transportation and
Safety Board have been extremely careful not to speculate, and the
lack of any ``steer'' has to some extent encouraged the media to
make up theories.
</P>
<P>
   But the nationality of the crew and the plane have also
apparently encouraged reporters to make irresponsible guesses at
what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In previous crashes, infighting between the U.S. agencies
investigating the incident has contributed to a welter of
conflicting stories about the cause. This time, the authorities
have sought to stop speculation by focusing on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymous sources from one U.S. agency have repeatedly
leaked their views to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest indications from the cockpit voice recorder are
that there was a problem with the aircraft, the crew tried to deal
with it, but that things went rapidly from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happens. Alarms go off. Both work to try to fix
it,'' an unnamed source told the Associated Press after the
investigators listened to the tape for the first time. ``There is
some kind of problem that they're dealing with. It gets
progressively worse. And the tape stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The source, however, apparently did not speak Arabic and had not
understood anything on the tape, which tends to undermine his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   From the aircraft's flight data recorder, it is known that for
some reason the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft began
dropping from 33,000 feet at a 40-degree angle, reaching a speed
just short of the sound barrier, and reaching zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The engines were apparently manually shut down during the dive.
It reached 16,000 feet and then climbed back up to 24,000 feet
before falling rapidly again and breaking up. This pattern of
events does not fit readily with any known course of action in
response to a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports from the voice recorder did seem to lessen the
probability of one of the many competing, and contradictory,
accounts made up in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of a fight between the crew, who were
speaking ``like pals,'' said AP. Nor was there any sign that
someone had entered the cockpit. Indeed, there was never any
evidence whatsoever for this theory.
</P>
<P>
   A government official told Newsweek magazine that Boeing was
``pushing'' the theory that a cockpit struggle was responsible for
the crash. Boeing denied this. If mechanical failure is the cause,
then there might be serious implications for Boeing, including
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   The supposition of a cockpit fight was based on the fact that
the flight elevators had been moved in opposite directions moments
before the aircraft crashed, and from this the inference was drawn
that the pilot and co-pilot were acting against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, it assumed that the decision to shut off the autopilot
and the engines were irrational, something that cannot be known
until the causes of the aircraft's initial problem are known.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that one of the crew might have tried to kill
himself, or have fought with his colleagues, was based on no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It seems highly unlikely that U.S. newspapers would have made
these accusations against an America pilot who had died in similar
circumstances, and the families and friends of the crew have
understandably responded angrily to these libels.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahmed al Habashy, the lead pilot, was stable and happy,
his wife and brother have said. He was close to retirement. ``He
never smoked or drank alcohol,'' his brother told Agence France
Presse. ``He had no bad habits. He was very religious and prayed
and was always reading the Koran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald felt it necessary to add that he was ``not an
extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-pilot Adel Anwar was due to be married five days after the
flight and had exchanged slots with another flight officer to
return home sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories with equally little evidence have also surfaced.
The first was that the reverse thrusters might have malfunctioned,
based on a similiar crash of a Boeing 767 in Thailand _ an aircraft
that was made at the same time as the Egyptair plane. The data
recorders seemed to rule this out.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported that a flight attendant called Hassan
Sherif telephoned his wife, Rania, from New York to say ``there was
something wrong with the plane'' and that he was ``very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair said that there was a flight attendant on the aircraft
called Hassan Farouk, not Hassan Sherif. Rania Reda is his fiancee,
not his wife. ``He just told me that the plane was delayed at Los
Angeles and he is waiting for the plane,'' Reda told Associated
Press Television News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than one newspaper has blamed terrorism, citing the
aircraft's flight profile, the suddenness of the problem and the
lack of a distress call. It has also been noted that the aircraft
had a large number of Egyptian military personnel on it.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI have given no signs that they are actively looking at
terrorism as a likely cause, though some kind of sudden incident
might have led the aircraft to depressurize rapidly, and the crew
might then have taken it lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaks from the inquiry may come from the FBI, which
would take over the investigation if there was a strong presumption
of criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a
number of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for
an expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

   Equally, it assumed that the decision to shut off the autopilot
and the engines were irrational, something that cannot be known
until the causes of the aircraft's initial problem are known.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that one of the crew might have tried to kill
himself, or have fought with his colleagues, was based on no
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It seems highly unlikely that U.S. newspapers would have made
these accusations against an America pilot who had died in similar
circumstances, and the families and friends of the crew have
understandably responded angrily to these libels.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ahmed al Habashy, the lead pilot, was stable and happy,
his wife and brother have said. He was close to retirement. ``He
never smoked or drank alcohol,'' his brother told Agence France
Presse. ``He had no bad habits. He was very religious and prayed
and was always reading the Koran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald felt it necessary to add that he was ``not an
extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-pilot Adel Anwar was due to be married five days after the
flight and had exchanged slots with another flight officer to
return home sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories with equally little evidence have also surfaced.
The first was that the reverse thrusters might have malfunctioned,
based on a similiar crash of a Boeing 767 in Thailand _ an aircraft
that was made at the same time as the Egyptair plane. The data
recorders seemed to rule this out.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported that a flight attendant called Hassan
Sherif telephoned his wife, Rania, from New York to say ``there was
something wrong with the plane'' and that he was ``very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptair said that there was a flight attendant on the aircraft
called Hassan Farouk, not Hassan Sherif. Rania Reda is his fiancee,
not his wife. ``He just told me that the plane was delayed at Los
Angeles and he is waiting for the plane,'' Reda told Associated
Press Television News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than one newspaper has blamed terrorism, citing the
aircraft's flight profile, the suddenness of the problem and the
lack of a distress call. It has also been noted that the aircraft
had a large number of Egyptian military personnel on it.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI have given no signs that they are actively looking at
terrorism as a likely cause, though some kind of sudden incident
might have led the aircraft to depressurize rapidly, and the crew
might then have taken it lower.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaks from the inquiry may come from the FBI, which
would take over the investigation if there was a strong presumption
of criminal activity. The FBI has been heavily criticized for a
number of investigations recently, and is seeking extra funds for
an expansion and reorganization of its activities _ including a new
counter-terrorism unit. &QL;

<P>
   Millionaire fever has swept America. And we are not talking
about the booming economy or the tide of winnings from stock
trading on Wall Street. This is all about a TV game show that
started in Britain and is now commanding the airwaves on this side
of the water _ ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ABC network began airing its own version of the ITV
quiz program in the summer, it has seen its ratings explode. Last
week, it started a run of 15 hour-long ``Millionaire'' shows _ one
a day, every day for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It has trampled everything in its way, with minimum effort. The
American ``Millionaire'' is identical to the original ITV model _
the same melodramatic techno music, the same swivelling lights,
even the same spaceship set.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is no Chris Tarrant. The quiz-master is Regis
Philbin, a stalwart of U.S. daytime talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone in the U.S. seems aware of the show's ancestry.
Philbin is credited with inventing the catchphrase: ``Is that your
final answer?'' Anyone who has watched Tarrant's teasing of
competitors will know that this is his catchphrase, not Philbin's.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday this week, ``Millionaire'' drew in 26.8 million
viewers. It is estimated that after the end of this current run,
more than half of the American population will have watched it. No
other show on this autumn's American television schedule has come
near it in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And a surprising number of people are making money from the
show, from Jasper Carrott to Rupert Murdoch, because it is financed
by a premium rate phone line for contestants keen to get on the
show. This meant that Celador Productions, the company that makes
it, was allowed to keep the rights to sell the format
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Celador, one of whose shareholders is Carrott, an English, has
sold the format to more than 52 countries, including Australia,
South Africa, Spain, Holland, Germany, Russia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In each territory it is dominating its peak-time slot. The
rights are shared between Celador, whose managing director, Paul
Smith, is probably already a millionaire, and the show's creators.
</P>
<P>
   Also making money is Rupert Murdoch's News International, whose
Broadsystems call center handles the phone line and takes a cut.
And Tarrant will make a cool $4 million (pounds sterling 2.5
million) for presenting the first 90 episodes in Britain. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Beware of Greeks bearing flags
 &HT;    For release Nov. 24, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The demonstrators have been described both as anarchists and
communists; an awkward alignment of contrasting beliefs. They tore
through the streets of downtown Athens, torching businesses,
looting and, of course, burning the American flag practically under
the nose of visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many amendments the Congress tries to shove into
our Constitution, one banning flag burning will have no consequence
in Athens, or Baghdad, even Belgrade. They're beyond our
Constitutional reach. Where they get all those flags to burn is of
interest to me, as I would like to buy into what must be a
profitable business of supplying particularly incendiary American
flags to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, 10,000 Greeks torched their own capital _ and some
American flags _ to protest U.S. policy in Yugoslavia, Kosovo and
Bosnia, all of which shows you how stupid they are. ``We've Burned
Ourselves,'' Reuters News Service quoted a leading Athens newspaper
headline.
</P>
<P>
   It always has impressed me that American flags are game for
flame for any of our diverse worldwide foreign policies but when
the Soviets and, now, the Russians are involved in controversial
conduct, it doesn't seem to happen.
</P>
<P>
   This likely is because no one is producing Russian flags as
quickly as they are American flags. Availability is critical to
flag burners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Russians slaughtering Chechnyans and, several years
earlier, Afghans, there seems to be a noticeable need for Russian
flags to burn. As we mass produce American flags for foreign
conflagration, we ought to think of doing the same with Russian
flags. We could be well into a thriving export business which would
go toward helping us repay some of the money we either loan or
otherwise allow to sift into foreign hands.
</P>
<P>
   With the anarchist/communist underbelly of Greece evident and
with Clinton, in one of his Jimmy Carter-like moments of contrition
over the U.S. supporting a Greek military junta in 1967, I was
wondering if anyone in Greece was considering thanking us for other
measures we took on behalf of the Greek people?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps memories do not go back as far as 1947 when Harry Truman
and the U.S. Congress rushed to support the Greek people who were
threatened by advancing Soviet communism. Hundreds of millions of
dollars were shipped to Athens so the nation could remain
independent of Soviet control.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, things did go bad with the junta we supported in
1967, especially the deadly crackdown it committed on student
demonstrators in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a Cold War thing, us supporting the military right
against a rebellious left that was tied to the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   That left apparently has not forgotten the U.S. and the junta,
and never wanted to remember the U.S. saving Greece from communism
in 1947. Each year at this time, much of the same group stages
anti-American protests for our support of the junta. Usually, it
goes unnoticed by the world media. But when the president of the
United States happens to be in Greece at the same time, followed by
a press corps the size of Texas, it becomes more of a launching pad
for violence and grievance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the cost of being a world policeman. I don't believe
that the U.S. so much wants to be the global cop as it has been
kept in that position by a world that cannot get along, either
internally or across borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of that assignment, mistakes certainly can be
made. They subsequently result in flag burning and other
interruptions to normal relations. The Chinese went on a nifty
flag-burning bent after we mistakenly and stupidly bombed their
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-American protest in Athens had to do more with ethnic
bonding than anything else. The Greeks are close to the Serbians,
just as are the Russians. No matter the ritual slaughter of
Albanian Kosovars at the hands of the Serbians, which brought the
U.S. into the melee, the Serbians could do no wrong in the minds of
the protesting Athenians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit simply inflamed the fringe of Greek politics.
</P>
<P>
   And it did wonders for the flag salesmen.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES
 &HT;    Fourth in a series
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Who comes to Paris for a moral lesson? Not me. But
that's how it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out I got to meet Patricia Eakins, a New Yorker on a
book tour here.
</P>
<P>
   She was reading excerpts from her latest novel for a couple of
dozen fans gathered in the loft of the Village Voice, a favorite
bookshop for Americans in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Better had she excerpted the title. Hold on while I quote it in
full:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marvelous Adventures of Pierre Baptiste
</P>
<P>
   ``Father and Mother
</P>
<P>
   ``First and Last
</P>
<P>
   ``Including:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tribulations of Bondage in the Sugar Isles
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierre's Escape from Certain Harm to His Person
</P>
<P>
   ``How He Was Marooned
</P>
<P>
   ``His Friends &AMP; Religion
</P>
<P>
   ``His True Wife &AMP; Fishy Consorts
</P>
<P>
   ``His Children, Born from His Mouth Like Words
</P>
<P>
   ``Physics and Metaphysics
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyclopedish Histoire
</P>
<P>
   ``Flora, Fauna, &AMP; Mysteriosi
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenge and Devotion
</P>
<P>
   ``Divinations
</P>
<P>
   ``Commonplace Book
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a True Account of the Life and Times of an African Man
of Letters,
</P>
<P>
   ``A Son of Guinee Born into Bondage,
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Ambitions Were Realized in STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED WAYS,
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet Who Made His PEACE with Several Gods
</P>
<P>
   ``and Established A REALM of Equality &AMP; Freedom &AMP; Bounty,
</P>
<P>
   ``in Which No Creature Lives from Another's Labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a Little Late, Folks, So Good Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Scratch that last line. That was just me trying to catch my
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the novel is breathtaking, created from the pen of a
white woman who grew up in the Sixties, writing eloquently as if
from the heart and soul, and from inside the skin, of a black man
in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that some critics may characterize her presumption to
do so as ... uppity?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own experience,'' she told her audience at the Village
Voice. ``People of color have been less worried about this than
politically correct people with no color.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Eakins, who speaks as eloquently as she writes, may
appear white, but ``I don't feel altogether white,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She goes on to explain that her first husband, whom she married
in her early 20s, was an African-American. It was an experience
that drastically altered the world she lives in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple things like suddenly noticing that at midnight if I
stepped out in the street and hailed a cab, one would come. If he
stepped out into the street and hailed a cab ... `` Her voice
wavered. Even now it's hard for her talk about it ... ``one would
not come.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that she doesn't trust that feeling of privilege, which
is central, she said, ``to what we call whiteness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think whiteness is just a gradation of skin color.
What we mean when we say whiteness is a whole structure of
privilege. I do not accept the thought of myself as being the
bearer of this privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she doesn't deny that it would be most
difficult to move away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just make one little moral gesture in your life, and
you're suddenly no longer white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marvelous Adventures of Pierre Baptiste,'' which took her
ten years to produce, is hardly one little gesture.
</P>
<P>
   For her, it was an encounter with the structures ``of
colonialism, of racism, of whiteness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privilege is very attractive. The people in the big house have
the nice clothes, they have the fancy parties, and the good food
and the music. It took me a while to stop identifying with
privilege. It is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to try, ``The Marvelous Adventures of Pierre
Baptiste'' ($19.95, New York University Press) is an easy first
step _ a quick read once you get past the title.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP hate for Clinton doomed 106th Congress
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first session of the 106th Congress is petered out in vague
ignominy and ill grace, having fussed much and accomplished little.
But it did do this: It set a new standard for surly partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Congress first wasted months of its time and the nation's
persisting in an impeachment that was obviously doomed from the
first gavel fall, all over a president's attempt to dance _ and
when that wasn't working, to lie _ his way out of admitting to an
affair that didn't even have stylishness to commend it to public
prurience.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to punish President Clinton for besting them, Congress's
Republican leaders spent the rest of the year harrying even his
smallest initiatives and pestering his conduct of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Congress didn't do: It didn't square Social Security
away for the long run. It didn't reform political campaign funding.
It didn't help Medicare seniors cover prescription costs. All three
options were on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what it did do: It put anti-environmental riders on just
about every passing piece of legislation. (Clinton used vetoes and
veto threats to unhorse most.) It kited a nearly $800 billion tax
cut that would have overwhelmingly gone to our richest. (The public
yawned. The plan flopped.) It bored new tax loopholes for
big-business political contributors. (See above, ``Campaign funding
reform, failure of.'') And rather than just scraping out-dated
spending caps, it resorted to goofy budget dodges so it could
tender at least meager new support for education, teaching
hospitals and economic development in down-and-out neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The session was mainly marked by the palpable Republican hatred
of Clinton, understandable not because the president is the
scoundrel Republicans insist he is _ mostly he's not _ but because
he has used his superior political skills to put them in one after
another box and to eke out small victories for his own program.
More teachers and cops here, a plan there to protect at least
patches of greenery from development.
</P>
<P>
   Expect nothing better next year. The GOP majorities remain too
thin to dominate. Clinton, facing a no-win game on the Hill, will
concentrate on foreign policy, where he has some maneuvering room.
Both parties will ballyhoo high-profile legislation meant only to
create bugle-call issues for the election. The big, totemistic
Republican initiatives won't survive Clinton's veto. The Democratic
ones won't get out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the nation can expect improvement after that is up to
voters. In one of history's longest-running practical jokes, voters
in the 1980s elected a Republican presidency and Democratic
Congresses; in the '90s, a Democratic presidency and Republican
Congresses.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest bloc was neither Democratic or Republican. It
was no-shows. Nothing in the politics of the two decades enticed
them to polls. Maybe disgust finally will. It should. If so, this
year's Congress can claim a lot of the credit.

SLEEPING COMFORT STARTS WITH A GOOD PILLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A full day's activities requires a good night's
sleep. In addition to a good mattress, you should treat yourself to
a proper pillow.
</P>
<P>
   All pillows come with a comfort lifetime (approximately five to
10 years for down or feather and six months to two years for
polyester pillows) before they lose their fluffiness and need to be
replaced. Punching the pillow as you toss and turn can also break
it down faster.
</P>
<P>
   An old or broken pillow will no longer support your neck and
spine in a proper manner.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration and oils from your head also can mat down your
pillows, according to Pacific Coast Feather Co. in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Pillows filled with down offer the ultimate in adjustability and
outlast synthetic fibers. Down and feather combinations contour to
your needs, but with a bit more resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Test your current down and feather pillow by fluffing it,
squeezing out air and folding it in half (in thirds for king size).
If it unfolds to its original shape, it's fine, according to
Pacific Coast Feather. Do the same for polyester, but place a
10-ounce weight on top, such as a medium tennis shoe. A broken
pillow will remain folded.
</P>
<P>
   A good pillow will provide just the right support no matter what
position you choose for sleep, as opposed to a pillow that you have
to fit into position to be comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   If you tend to sleep on your side, choose a firm pillow; on your
back, choose a medium firm pillow; on your stomach, choose a soft
pillow.
</P>
<P>
   To test a new pillow for adjustability, push the opposing
corners into the center of the pillow. If the pillow retains its
new shape, your pillow will adjust for your personal comfort.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a bed pillow, always look for a reputable
manufacturer, as you get what you pay for. Look for pillows with
long warranties, which mean a better value.
</P>
<P>
   Always protect your bed pillows by using both a pillow protector
and a pillow case. Fluff them regularly to retain shape and absorb
fresh air.

ON-LINE SHOPPING GROWS, BUT CATALOGS STILL RULE

<P>
   It has got a high gee-whiz factor, the stores never close and
you can shop till your browser crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But is on-line shopping for the holidays an easier, better,
safer alternative to schlepping to a mall or ordering from that
stack of catalogs overflowing your mailbox this time of year?
</P>
<P>
   Depends on what you seek from a ``dot com'' experience. Choice
is not an issue. There are thousands of companies selling
merchandise online _ type in the name of your favorite store
followed by .com and voila! _ and the temptation to buy can be
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   American consumers are expected to spend a record $9.5 billion
by shopping on the Internet this holiday season, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Consumer Reports concluded in a 13-page ``Holiday.shop''
special report in its November issue that on-line shopping Web
sites have a downside. They can be vague when it comes to security
and shipping costs; inventory can be thin; navigating page after
page of items can be exhausting; and ordering procedures can be
Byzantine.
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to thumb through catalogs or to click your mouse on
the buy icon? Consumer Reports' staff members gave mail-order
catalog shopping the edge over cyber shopping in a head-to-head
competition from 25 companies across a variety of categories: ease
of use, content, shipping and others.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hold a piece of merchandise in your hands _ and
not just view it on a computer screen _ before you buy it, nothing
can compare with reality-based shopping in an actual store.
</P>
<P>
   Although you will pay in time and transportation costs, you will
be spared the high fees for shipping and handling of goods
purchased on line _ quite often 30 to 50 percent of the cost of the
product tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   And for conspiracy theorists or the merely moderately paranoid,
cyber shopping is fraught with privacy issues. Web merchants
routinely track a consumer's movements across a site, time spent on
each page, which photos are viewed, buying patterns and other
nuances.
</P>
<P>
   The data are analyzed, sold or swapped with other companies for
solicitation opportunities via e-mail advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies are clearly concerned about a backlash over
privacy and security. The Goliath Amazon.com, for instance, has a
three-page statement about its complex and confusing privacy
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Let the merchants beware. Consumers are keeping their critical
eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   BizRate.com rates e-business and claims to be objective (on-line
companies can't pay to be listed or featured on its Web site).
Founded in 1996, BizRate.com arrives at its ratings by asking tens
of thousands of consumers to report on their on-line shopping
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints about on-line shopping _ particularly
on-line auctions involving a third party _ have risen sharply in
the past year, according to Joe Mahoney, a spokesman for the New
York Consumer Protection Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because an entity has its own Web site does not mean it
has been checked for consumer reliability,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   And in terms of aesthetics, is the on-line shopping experience
as meaningful, as, say, fueling up first with a double latte amid
fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies before strolling the aisles of
your favorite bookstore or clothing boutique and sampling a product
in a tactile way before purchase?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, for millions of e-shoppers, for whom time and
geography are problematic, buying through the Internet is an
efficient alternative.
</P>
<P>
   On-line shopping taken to the next level involves
price-comparison services called bots (short for robots).
Essentially, they level the playing field between buyers and
sellers by offering lightning-quick price comparisons for a product
among dozens of merchants around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some bots specialize in a certain product, such as computers or
foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty is that online shopping is a growth business.
New companies, bots and ranking services are coming on line daily.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever form you choose _ digital, catalog mail-order or live
and in-person _ happy shopping.

THRILLERS ON TAPE SHOWCASE WOMEN AUTHORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cold Hit,'' by Linda Fairstein. Read by Allison Janney.
Abridged, approximately 4.5 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death Du Jour,'' by Kathy Reichs. Read by Katherine Borowitz.
Abridged, approximately 4.5 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravity,'' by Tess Gerritsen. Read by Campbell Scott.
Abridged, approximately 4.5 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $25.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery-thriller genre long ago stopped being a men's club.
For almost two decades Sue Grafton and other women have
demonstrated that either gender is capable of capturing the
public's fancy with well-conceived characters, fresh plots and a
fine eye for detail.
</P>
<P>
   What is relatively new, however, is the growing number of
successful, professional women who are turning to writing in their
spare time, crafting thrillers out of their chosen careers.
Patricia Cornwall, the forensic pathologist, probably opened the
door farther than anyone else, but others are quickly following,
crossing the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Fairstein, Reichs and Gerritsen interesting to
contrast. Read with flawless style by screen and stage veterans
Janney, Borowitz and Scott, respectively, these three authors'
books on tape can best be separated by how well they adhere to the
basics of the mystery genre, as well as their own careers.
</P>
<P>
   Fairstein, a sex crimes prosecutor in the Manhattan district
attorney's office, and Reichs, a professor and forensic
anthropologist for North Carolina's chief medical examiner, have
each started a series based on what each woman knows best.
Fairstein has created Alexandra Cooper, an assistant DA, while
Reichs' alter-ego is Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic
anthropologist based in Montreal, where Reichs spends parts of each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Both have mastered the genre, sharing the drama of their working
worlds through fictional characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Hit,'' Fairstein's third, may be her best yet. She has
Cooper navigating the slippery sanctums of art galleries and forged
masterpieces while being stalked herself. ``Death Du Jour'' is
Reichs' second, and it is every bit as good as her debut, ``Deja
Dead.'' She has Brennan unraveling a case that takes her back and
forth between Montreal and the Carolinas, mining the physical
worlds she knows best, too.
</P>
<P>
   Neither woman has quit her so-called day job, though it would
seem they could if they so desired. Both have enjoyed best-seller
status right out of the box. Money must be a non-issue. Maybe
neither is sure if writing is what she really wants to do, though
each has demonstrated that she can handle this craft just as deftly
as the high-powered jobs they have both thrived in.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to Gerritsen, who has abandoned a successful
practice as an internist to devote all her attention to writing
thrillers. She also has seen her books reach the best-seller lists,
but it's almost impossible to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   With each story _ ``Gravity'' is her fourth _ Gerritsen goes
farther over the top, taking medical mysteries into the terrain of
science fiction. She knows about intubating and other procedures,
to be sure, but she appears to be way out of her element writing
about a NASA space station that has been infected by deadly,
contagious cells.
</P>
<P>
   Masters of this genre don't necessarily have to create a central
character around whom they anchor their tales, but such a device
gives the writer a focal point and can keep her centered. It's
working well for Fairstein and Reichs, and I suspect Gerritsen
would benefit in a big way if she found a heroine for her harrowing
stories.

LEAGUE'S BAR HAS BEEN RAISED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Their locker room was an intriguing mix of
ringing cell phones, cigar smoke, full and empty bottles of Domaine
Ste. Michelle, outrageous statements _ ``I think we are one of the
best teams in the hemisphere!'' _ and smiling people, roughly 95
percent of whom did not take the pitch for D.C. United in their 2-0
MLS Cup win over the Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to see so many happy people, but the postgame
celebration was not the reason that Sunday afternoon was American
soccer's best in four months.
</P>
<P>
   United coach, Thomas Rongen, sat on a Foxboro Stadium bench,
crossed his legs, and tapped on a fresh pack of Camels. He used to
be the Revolution's head coach, but the team fired him. Now he is
the coach of a three-time league champion. He was asked why New
England has been a three-time playoff outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much to tell,'' he said. ``I don't have enough
time to tell you about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a slow drag, exhaled, and said, ``Right now, I'm just
going to talk to my wife.'' Rongen then spotted his wife under a
tree. The couple hugged and laughed and kissed under the tree as if
they were dating for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to see a coach win a title one year after he was
fired, but his redemption was not the reason Sunday was American
soccer's best afternoon in four months.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people will tell you the day was great because 44,910
fans came to the stadium when they could have been at home watching
Patriots-Dolphins on television. Those people are right, but that
is only half the story. Having 44,000-plus in the stadium is one
thing, but you better make sure you have something good to show
them. D.C. United did that and simultaneously raised the ante in
this four-year-old MLS game.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the reason American soccer had its best afternoon
since July, when the women's national team defeated China and won
the World Cup in a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   What D.C. United did Sunday was force the league to play
catch-up. There have been four championship games in league
history. United has won three and lost one. This is not a fluke.
The truth is that the team Bruce Arena built (and the one Rongen
coaches) is embarrassingly better than everyone else. In other
words, the league is not strong enough. The challenge from United
is simple: Match our level of play, or watch us become the
Canadiens, Celtics, Bulls, Yankees, or 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Any pro soccer league in the US needs this challenge. The
concept of the MLS is good; now the overall play has to catch up to
the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think dynasties are bad for the league,'' Arena
said. ``I think they're good. To say the top team should be knocked
down doesn't make any sense. It's stupid. You want to make the weak
teams stronger, but you don't have to make the strong teams weaker
in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Although United general manager Kevin Payne said his team is one
of the strongest in the hemisphere, the reality is that you could
take this team to Mexico and find plenty of competition for it. The
beauty, though, is that the team's coaches and players are not
satisfied with being dominant in MLS. They are constantly seeking
improvement, constantly seeking an advantage, constantly looking
for local and international talent. That, too, makes them good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got a head start on a lot of teams from the very
beginning,'' defender Eddie Pope said. ``We have had coaches who
know how to put teams together. And everything surrounding the team
_ like training facilities _ has always been first-class. We have
done things that other teams don't even think about doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, someone in LA is saying that the previous
statements are ridiculous. They are saying that the Galaxy could
have won the title if defender of the year Robin Fraser hadn't been
knocked out of the game with a fractured clavicle. Fraser was in
the game for nine minutes before there was contact with United's
Roy Lassiter. Depending on whom you ask, it was either excessive
contact or an unfortunate circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the Galaxy were victims of one of the sloppiest
plays I have seen in any sport this year. In the 45th minute,
trailing 1-0, all Galaxy goalie Kevin Hartman had to do was pick up
the ball and kick it to Walpole. Instead _ incredibly _ he fiddled
with the ball like he was playing by himself in his backyard. Ben
Olsen, the game's MVP, got the ball and put it into the net that
Hartman was not defending.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge mistake,'' smiled Arena. ``A young goalie will make
mistakes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And a dynastic team will take advantage of those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say he made a mistake,'' Pope said, ``but we talked
about things like that before the game. We talked about chasing the
back passes, putting pressure on those passes.''
</P>
<P>
   The more you parted the thick cigar smoke in the champions'
locker room and listened to their testimonials, the more you
understood that they don't have any hidden secrets to their
success. They are members of the most idealistic pro league in the
country. Everyone has the same salary cap, which is under $1.5
million per team (for perspective, the Bruins' Byron Dafoe makes
over $3 million, the salary cap for two MLS teams). There is not a
drastic large- and small-market disparity like there is in
baseball. There are no six-year, $70-plus million contract
extensions like the ones you see in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   New England has just as much of a title chance as D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not that far from being a playoff team,'' Arena said
of the Revolution, ``but they are a long way from being a
championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rongen agreed with that but insisted that he didn't have enough
time to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution and the rest of the league had better find out
what they don't know and what United does know. The sooner they
find out, the stronger the league will be.

SO IT'S COME TO THIS POINT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you notice the scores? Virginia Tech 62, Temple 7. Kansas
State 66, Missouri 0.
</P>
<P>
   Mismatches for sure. But no matter what anyone tells you, the
totality of the routs was not an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the Bowl Championship Series rankings,
where it's not so much whether you win, but by how much.
</P>
<P>
   We are at the stage of the season when the computers and their
printouts will crunch the numbers to determine who plays Florida
State in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship Jan. 4 in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, ranked No. 2 but feeling the breath of Nebraska
on its back, is lobbying hard for a spot in the game, and knows
that victory margin is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with a weak schedule _ according to the computers _ the
Hokies are not a slam dunk to make it to New Orleans even if they
beat Boston College Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska maintains it still has a chance if it beats Colorado
Friday, then wins the Big 12 title game against Texas in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State also believes it has a chance if Nebraska is beaten
and BC can upset Virginia Tech. But the Wildcats know they have to
make some points, so to speak, with their margins of victory. Thus
the destruction of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what the BCS wanted when they set up this thing?''
asked one coach Sunday. ``People running up the scores, creating
bad feelings. That doesn't seem like the best system.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, but it's the only system that is in place right now.
Saturday's games cleared up the picture somewhat. Florida State is
11-0 and has one slot clinched.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech and Nebraska seem the leading contenders to fill
the other slot.
</P>
<P>
   And with it all a numbers game, look for Virginia Tech to show
no mercy from the opening kickoff against BC. This will not be a
casual game, where winning is the only thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
   That will put BC in an interesting situation. The Eagles are
flying after their 31-29 win over Notre Dame. At worst they're
going to Tucson to play a Big 12 team in the New Year's Eve
Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   There is still an outside possibility of the Eagles going to
Jacksonville for the Gator Bowl Jan. 1. But that would require a
win over Virginia Tech and a Miami loss to either Syracuse or
Temple the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling among the people running the bowls is that Miami
would bring no one to Tucson but might bring some fans to
Jacksonville, while BC has a better chance of attracting fans to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   So why not take care of both bowls and both teams by sending the
Eagles to Tucson and the Hurricanes to Jacksonville?
</P>
<P>
   As for the other BCS bowls, this is the way the situation looks
right now, projecting Virginia Tech and Florida State in the Sugar
Bowl: Fiesta Bowl _ Nebraska vs. Tennessee; Orange Bowl _
Florida-Alabama winner vs. Michigan; Rose Bowl _ Stanford vs.
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a roll
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UMass, fresh off a 62-20 win over UConn, will face Furman in
Saturday's Division 1-AA opening-round playoff game. ``We're
playing pretty good now,'' said UMass coach Mark Whipple. ``Better
than we were at this time last year.'' Which, of course, turned
into a national championship season . . . The situation at North
Carolina has turned ugly now that it appears coach Carl Torbush
will be fired. Torbush got only two years out of a five-year
contract to prove he could run the Tar Heels program. Last year he
went 7-5 and reached a bowl game. This year he was 3-8 with an
injury-riddled team, finishing the season with a 38-0 win over Duke
Saturday. ``It's not fair. It's not right,'' said Tar Heels punter
Brian Schmitz. ``For a school as classy as North Carolina to be so
classless is mind-boggling.'' Indeed.
</P>
<P>

   Nice finish for Penn State, which went from the BCS title game
to maybe the Outback Bowl with three consecutive losses, including
a 35-28 setback to Michigan State Saturday. An interesting bowl
matchup would be Penn State-Mississippi State, pitting Paterno vs.
old nemesis Jackie Sherrill. This is the first time Penn State
ended the regular season with three straight losses since 1914 . .
. It looks like Michigan State, which had the same record and won
the head-to-head meeting against Michigan, will be relegated to the
Citrus Bowl, while the Wolverines get a BCS at-large berth. The
reason? Michigan has more appeal for television . . . Another
intriguing matchup would be Hawaii vs. Oregon State in Honolulu on
Christmas Day, matching two coaches who were in the NFL last
season. June Jones was in San Diego and Dennis Erickson was in
Seattle. Both have made the smooth transition back to the college
game. Oregon State is playing in its first bowl game since 1964,
while Hawaii went from a winless season to a share of the WAC
championship in one year . . . Georgia Tech's stunning loss to Wake
Forest wiped out the slim chance that quarterback Joe Hamilton had
of catching Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne in the Heisman Trophy
race . . . Star of the year has to be Texas Christian running back
LaDainian Tomlinson, who broke the NCAA Division 1-A rushing record
for a game by picking up 406 yards (and scoring six touchdowns) in
a 52-24 win over Texas-El Paso . . . More bad news for South
Carolina, which finished an 0-11 season with a 31-21 loss to
Clemson. The Gamecocks became the first team in SEC history to
finish 0-11 without forfeits . . . With Notre Dame no longer
eligible, the Big East is set to place four teams in bowl games.
The conference could have five teams eligible if Pittsburgh beats
West Virginia Saturday. But if Syracuse loses to Miami, count on
the Orangemen being the odd-team out, with Pitt getting the Big
East's Music City Bowl slot.

EARLY RETIREMENT REQUIRES SAVING EVEN MORE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like your opinion on whether I am on the right track.
I am 39 and have the following investments: A Putnam IRA account of
$200,000, divided evenly between Putnam Growth Equity Investors and
Putnam Voyager, to which I add $500 a month; a variable annuity
account of $45,000 divided evenly among Fidelity Contrafund, Janus
Balanced, Janus Worldwide, MFS Research, and T. Rowe Price Equity
Income funds, to which I add $1,000 a month; a holding in Mainstay
Capital Appreciation fund of $30,000, to which I add $1,000 a
month; and $15,000 in a checking account bearing a high interest
level. I am in software sales and earn about $120,000 a year. Am I
saving enough for retirement in 16 years? Would you recommend
changing any of my positions?
</P>
<P>
   S.A., Falmouth, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You'd be close to a comfortable position, depending on how
much you think you will need.
</P>
<P>
   If your entire portfolio (including your bank savings) grew at
an average 10 percent rate, and if you continue contributions at
the current $2,500 a month rate, you would amass $2,460,625.
</P>
<P>
   After deducting the amount you are saving, you are currently
living on $90,000 a year. To get the same buying power as $90,000
brings today, you would need $156,058 after 16 years if inflation
averaged 3.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought you could live on the equivalent of $72,000 _ 80
percent of your current after-savings income _ you would need
$124,864. If you thought you could reduce your living expenses to
60 percent of their current level, you would need $93,635 income in
your first year of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When you retire at a fairly early age, its important that you
have a sizable amount of savings in excess of what you need to
provide your income stream.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, when you retire at age 55, it's possible your
retirement could last 40 years or so, and you will need to be able
to protect yourself against the inflation that's likely during
those later years.
</P>
<P>
   A comfortable margin might be to have two-thirds of your savings
providing your income stream, with the rest in reserve, invested in
growth securities to deal with that inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to that original projection, this means that you
might draw on $1,640,416 to provide income. If fixed-income yields
are in the neighborhood of 6.5 percent, that would mean you would
have $106,6276 to live on _ the equivalent of $61,500 in today's
money.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several positive factors that I am overlooking.
One is that if you increase your savings rate proportionally to any
increases in income, the projected accumulation would likely be
higher. Second, at some point you can probably count on some
benefits from Social Security, which will allow you to reduce your
reliance on your savings for an income stream. And third, the model
I have devised basically presumes that you want to live through
retirement in the happy position of seeing very little or no loss
of your capital.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you have limited interest in leaving an
estate, you can certainly draw much higher amounts from the savings
pool, seeking to manage things so that you will live comfortably
and will have sufficient funds to last out your life, but not
necessarily to make your heirs ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   As for your portfolio, I tally more that 87 percent of your
holdings in large-cap domestic stocks, which is far too much. Only
your cash savings, MFS Research, and portions of the holdings in
Janus Worldwide and Janus Balanced represent diversifications away
from that segment.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you limit the large-cap domestic segment of the total
portfolio to about 60 percent, building positions in small- and
mid-cap funds and increasing your overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
   A quick way to begin with the latter is to swap Janus Worldwide
(which holds about 35 percent of its portfolio in domestic issues)
for Janus Overseas, which holds a portfolio entirely devoted to
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are 32 and 31, respectively. We have a
3-year-old son and a 7-month-old daughter. Our savings are these:
$4,500 in US Savings bonds; $11,683 in traditional IRAs, of which
$7,300 is in a CD and the rest in stock funds; $10,600 in Roth
IRAs; 9,000 in taxable mutual fund accounts; $2,000 in credit union
savings; and $6,000 in individual stocks. We fully fund both IRAs
each year, and add a total of $550 a month to the other accounts.
We would like to retire at age 60 and to have a comfortable fixed
income, which I would guess to be $2,500 a month at today's values.
In addition to the assets above, I plan to have a military
retirement, plus a retirement from a future occupation. However, I
would like to find the road to a comfortable retirement without
counting on these retirement benefits. I feel we are way behind.
Can we get there from here?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Cape Cod, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although your total savings of $42,238 doesn't seem like a
huge nest egg, you have a lot of time to work on it. If you
maintain savings at the current level, and if your portfolio grows
at an average 10 percent rate for the next 28 years, you would
accumulate $1,929,323.
</P>
<P>
   You would require $78,605 a year to give you the same buying
power as $30,000 provides now, presuming inflation averages 3.5
percent. If a fixed-income portfolio could bring you an average 6.5
yield in 28 years, you would need only a little more than $1.2
million to fulfill your target.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of your accumulation could then be left in growth
vehicles to protect you against inflation. And any military and
civilian employment pension benefits you may earn would simply be
gravy. In short, far from being way behind, you are nicely on
schedule, and way ahead of many, many people who write to me.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of that pleasant news is based on the idea that you
achieve 10 percent average portfolio returns on your retirement
portfolio. You suggested a few changes in a part of your letter I
edited out, involving the savings bonds and the CD account among
your traditional IRA holdings.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that both of these are likely to provide a long-term
drag on your portfolio, and would move the CD money into the USAA
S&AMP;P 500 fund that is currently among your traditional IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the savings bonds, I would move both that money and the
ongoing contributions to a health care fund that concentrates on
medical equipment and pharmaceutical companies, such as Fidelity
Select Health Care fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I suggest you set a target dollar amount to accumulate
in your credit union account as emergency savings, and once that
target is reached, divert the $200 monthly contribution that is now
going into that account to investments with greater long-term
potential. The two fund categories that you might focus upon at
that point are international and small-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm 85 and no longer have any money in stocks; all my money
is in CDs. Lately I've noticed that banks are offering CDs for
periods of six or seven or 11 months. I'm thinking that something
is fishy in Denmark. Please enlighten us.
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Chula Vista, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think what you're seeing is the vehicles that banks are
promoting.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find CDs at the traditional durations, but given
the current uncertain interest rate climate, they aren't
particularly attractive, and they aren't being promoted very much.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you've noticed that in normal markets the longer you
put your money in a CD, the higher the rate you will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   But entering this week in the Boston market, three of nine banks
reporting CD rates are offering a lower rate for a 30-month CD than
for a 12-month certificate. A fourth offers 30- and 12-month CDs at
the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   The same uneven situation prevails, to a lesser extent,
nationally. As this is written, according to bankrate.com, the
national average for a 48-month CD is 5.46 percent _ lower than the
5.65 percent average for a 36-month CD and identical to the rate
for both 24- and 30-month CDs.
</P>
<P>
   So my take on this is that bankers are unenthusiastic about
writing some of the longer-term CDs, and thus have focused their
promotions on shorter issues.

DOMINANT DAVENPORT A TALL ORDER FOR HINGIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis's mother undoubtedly told her there'd
be days like this. That's what mothers are for: to warn their
offspring that no matter how well things are going, somebody might
just step up and flatten you.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those very rare days for Martina Hingis, the
No. 1 tennis player in the universe, who was knocked flatter than
the world before Columbus by Lindsay Davenport. Martina could have
masqueraded as a tortilla after Davenport worked her over, 6-4,
6-2, using a racket as a rolling pin.
</P>
<P>
   Bygone fight manager Joe Jacobs had an expression for what
happened on the blue carpeted rectangle of Madison Square Garden.
``We shoulda stood in bed!'' he would lament after one of his pugs
``got ruint.''
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis's mother/mentor/coach, Melanie Molitor, looked
like she was taking it on the chin, too. She sat in the first row,
among 14,653 patrons of the Chase Championships, the last roundup
of the century for the young brilliants of the game, with her eyes
popping at what Davenport was doing to her kid.
</P>
<P>
   Every time 6-foot-3-inch Davenport erupted with an ace or a
torrid, winning blast, Mom Molitor flinched sympathetically. She
resembled the venerable Boston pugilistic trainer, Al Lacy, whose
head jerked every time his middleweight champ, Paul Pender, got
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Martina got hit with winners so many times that she could have
modeled as a cheese from her homeland, Switzerland. This was not
Hingis bringing ruin on herself with errors; she committed but
seven. No, this was Davenport _ her left wrist aching and left
thigh tightly strapped _ crunching everything in sight, slugging
.726 with the stupendous total of nine aces and 36 winners of 62
points in 61 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Martina could run, but there was no shelter within the rectangle
as the ever-increasingly nimble Lindsay arrived everywhere the
Swiss kid figured she couldn't. Lindsay crushed the rubber lemons
so resoundingly you thought they would spurt juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't give me a chance,'' Hingis said accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best match I've played, especially when you
consider the opposition,'' Davenport said accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's was a tour de force of baselining, scampering,
serving, and volleying such as this climactic tourney has seldom
witnessed. Almost a quarter-century had passed since a similar
one-sided score was registered in a title bout: Chris Evert over
Martina Navratilova, 6-4, 6-2, at Los Angeles in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King, the champ who launched the Long Way Babies of
female tennis in 1972, calls Hingis ``a tennis genius,'' and she is
right. But even Einstein probably had days like this when his
theory of relativity seemed relatively irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was irreverent in her treatment of the genius. But
that doesn't mean 19-year-old Martina's wizardry won't continue to
drive most of her foes wrong-footedly mad as she weaves her
shotmaking webs, such as the one in which Venus Williams was
trapped in the semis, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
</P>
<P>
   However, Little Miss No. 1 is ever at risk in the land of the
sinewy, power-dealing giants: the Sisters Sledgehammer (Venus and
Serena Williams), Davenport, 6-foot Mary Pierce, and sizeable
Barbara Schett and Amelie Mauresmo. Taking them on,
back-to-brawny-back, as she did at the US Open (beating Venus,
losing the title to Serena) may make her wish she was Atlas in
drag. The Venus-Lindsay combo within 24 hours proved too much.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean, gold medalist Davenport's Olympic coach and
Federation Cup captain, grins, ``Lindsay fully believes in herself
these days. It took a while to believe that she could lose the
excess weight and be a genuine champ. She is the finest striker of
the ball in the game _ and will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Medusa, the Women's Tennis Association computer,
Hingis and Davenport are 1-2 for the year. But the public
perception must be that Lindsay, with her Wimbledon and Chase
triumphs and five other titles, is the player of the year _
finishing driving, as they say at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the genius in her family was sitting in the fourth row,
mom Anne Davenport, who says, ``I just thought Lindsay should have
her own game.'' She meant that the family was immersed in
volleyball, papa an Olympian, mom and two other daughters
first-class players. ``When Lindsay showed an aptitude for tennis,
I encouraged her'' _ although the rest of her family was pushing
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   The twine barrier between them must have seemed as high as a
volleyball net to Hingis, and Mt. Davenport as formidable as Etna.
</P>
<P>
   They will meet again, often. ``They're two of the reasons the
women's game has never been better,'' applauds their spiritual
mother, Billie Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Closing her thundering recital with three of her nine aces _ ``I
never did that before'' _ Lindsay actually rolled an 11. ``Really?
I won the last 11 points?''
</P>
<P>
   She did. With her hot hands, and 11s up her short sleeve, maybe
Long Lindsay should visit another sporting rectangle _ a Vegas
craps table.

 UNDATED: with Bernstein. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one prelude concert the Sextet for Clarinet, Piano and String
Quartet will be performed. This is actually a 1937 arrangement of
Copland's Short Symphony (1933), an orchestral work renowned for
its difficulties: relentless syncopations, crisscrossing rhythms
and almost constantly changing meters. Stravinsky wrote few pieces
stronger than this sextet. Yet it seldom turns up in chamber music
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another inexplicable rarity is the Piano Fantasy, which the
pianist Michael Boriskin will perform in the festival. Completed in
1957 after several years of labor, this is a monumental, gritty,
technically arduous half-hour composition, freely adapted from
12-tone techniques and true to its name. It holds up to any
20th-century piano piece, by Schoenberg, Messiaen or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Here the use of dissonance is bracing in a way that somehow
seems, well, American. There is no sense of European angst about
it. Rather, the astringent harmonies are ecstatic, energizing. It's
as if Copland were saying: ``Just listen to that dissonance. Isn't
it wonderful?'' The Fantasy is inexorable yet elusive in design,
like an adventure trip with ``few familiar landmarks,'' in the
words of the composer Arthur Berger.
</P>
<P>
   In many years of concertgoing I have come across only one
performance of the piece, during a Copland tribute presented by the
ensemble Boston Musica Viva at Jordan Hall in 1979. Copland, who
was present, had not heard the Fantasy performed for some time, he
said, and was awe-struck by the playing of the pianist, Randall
Hodgkinson. ``It's like you're reading my mind,'' Copland, clearly
moved, told the pianist.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic programs draw from all periods of Copland's
work, which are more diverse than is generally realized, especially
the period during the 1920s when Copland, trying to shake up his
language and make it American, borrowed from jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating jazz into his symphonic music ``signified a
defiant badge of contemporary urban America,'' Howard Pollack
writes in his new biography, ``Aaron Copland: The Life and Work of
an Uncommon Man.'' Thomson later referred to Copland's venture into
jazz as his friend's ``one wild oat.''
</P>
<P>
   Though witty, the remark is a bit unfair. Works like the Piano
Concerto and ``Music for the Theater,'' which will be performed by
the Philharmonic, are raucous, rude and vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   Copland eventually felt he had come to a dead end. Jazz was too
powerful; it resisted getting dressed up for the concert hall.
Copland's jazz works started sounding like stiff, self-conscious
imitations of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s he simplified his harmonic language. But by the
1950s he was already experimenting with 12-tone music. Pollack, in
his book, convincingly challenges an existing assumption, that
Copland, following Stravinsky's example, started writing 12-tone
music out of a fear of being considered obsolete by younger
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Copland was always curious about new developments. By this time
he felt that his harmonic language was becoming stale. Why did he
turn to dodecaphonic techniques, Bernstein once asked him?
``Because I need more chords,'' Copland replied. ``I've run out of
chords.''
</P>
<P>
   That Copland's music was so stylistically diverse would seem to
complicate the question of its American character. Isn't it futile
to specify what makes his music, or any music, American? What makes
German music German? Copland's bare, widely spaced modal harmonies
may conjure up the spacious American plains. But Palestrina wrote
similar chords in 16th-century Italy. Sturdy, simple hymns may
evoke plain-spoken American pioneers. But Martin Luther's chorale
tunes are just as simple and sturdy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a disarming quality in all of Copland's music that
comes from its shifting moods, by turns joyful and ecstatic,
brusque and riotous, pensive and reserved. Somehow, the shifts
never seem tortured or neurotic; rather, just two sides of the same
identity, expressed clearly, without apology or fuss. But is this
American?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that quality comes more from Copland's personality than
from any general character trait of the American people. For a
homosexual man coming of age in the America of the 1910s, Copland
was remarkably well adjusted. He accepted his difference, and the
resultant isolation, with inner calm and little self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he cultivated privacy. In public he was avuncular and
discreet about his personal life. With friends he was open and
easy. But the public reserve, the public face, was always there,
not least in his music.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable document movingly captures Copland's sense of
reserve as it relates to his music and illuminates the question of
his Americanness. In 1974 he conducted the chamber ensemble version
of ``Appalachian Spring'' for a Columbia recording. Included with
that album was a six-inch bonus record of excerpts from the
rehearsal session, and it is a revelation.

 &UR; UNDATED: a revelation. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The players are top-rank, and as Copland greets them, he wryly
says, ``I assume you all know the piece.'' Someone answers back,
just as wryly, ``Only by reputation.'' A collegial mood thus
established, the musicians set to work. Before hearing a note,
Copland issues directions for the tranquil opening episode of the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``A warm, soft sound without any sense of effort,'' he requests.
To the clarinetist, who will play the simple triadic opening motif,
which is the germ of the entire piece, Copland asks for a ``sort of
noncommittal sound.'' The musicians start to play, but Copland soon
stops them. ``Do it without any sense of diminuendo on each note,''
he tells the string players.
</P>
<P>
   At the first breakout section of the score, the Allegro dance,
he asks for the music to be bouncy, playful. ``This is a barnyard
dance,'' he says. ``It's not symphonic.'' When the dance fades
away, except for a recalcitrant jumpy flute, and a string chorale
tries to change the mood, he warns the musicians, ``Watch out, this
is getting too sweetly sentimental, a little too on the Massenet
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling moment comes at No. 16 in the score, when the
music seems to want to settle into a simple little oompahpah dance,
but the rhythms become irregular instead, and a solo clarinet plays
a wistful elongation of the triadic opening motif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it more American in spirit, in that the sentiment isn't
shown on the face,'' Copland says. ``More cool. The music by itself
is warm. You don't have to help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Copland never gave a more succinct summary of what being
American meant to him as a composer and a man. Maybe there is no
such thing as an essential American character. But in his work
Copland convinces us that there is. And if in pursuing this
American idiom, Copland limited his scope, he certainly humanized
his voice. That's what people respond to.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree Copland's call to find a collective national
voice resonated among his colleagues, his role in organizing
composers was pivotal. His work in this regard will be a recurring
topic in panels and lectures during the retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   Copland conscripted a little commando unit of American
composers. Thomson, Sessions, Roy Harris and Walter Piston were the
soldiers; Copland was the officer in charge.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was a loose-knit group. Harris spent most his time
out West teaching, taking it easy and writing neo-Romantic
symphonies that won him an enviable popularity, which has not
lasted. Piston was a conservative type, comfortably ensconced on
the Harvard faculty and not especially interested in shaking up the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions was essentially opposed to collective action on behalf
of American composers. He believed to his core that music was
either good or bad: something vastly more important, and
discernible, than whether it was French or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, after hearing Boulanger play through Copland's Symphony
for Organ and Orchestra (1924), on the piano, Sessions wrote his
friend a chastising letter. You ``deserve hell,'' Sessions wrote,
for ``allowing yourself, when you can write music of your own like
that, to take any interest whatever in other people's music, and
especially in the music of other young Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you see,'' he continued, ``that any two pages of your
symphony are worth all the collected works of the `jeunes
americains' that you so generously allow yourself to be interested
in, and who have got to stand or fall on their own strength?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, though primarily based in Paris from 1925 to 1940,
shared Copland's belief in the importance of organization.
Collectivism was in the air, and both Copland and Thomson felt that
composers had more to gain by cooperating than by competing. The
real competition, as Thomson later described it in his
autobiography, was the ``German-Austrian musical complex,'' which
he likened to an ``international cartel operating through the
familiar techniques of price-fixing, dumping and pressures on the
performing agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they believed, was to form American composer-run
organizations, professional guilds to assure fair payment of
royalties, promote performances and subsidize publication. They
encouraged their colleagues to follow their example and get
involved in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Composing music for theater, film, high school bands and the
like was admirable professional work. Copland was immensely pleased
when, after four prior nominations, he won an Oscar in 1949 for his
music for ``The Heiress.''
</P>
<P>
   This score and others will be discussed by two composers who
know the business from the inside out, Andre Previn and David
Raksin, in the final event of the festival, ``Copland and Film
Music,'' a program at the Museum of Modern Art on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   That the festival will end in a museum is fitting. Copland's
work has been felt well beyond the confines of the concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the filmmaker Spike Lee, who used Copland's music in
the soundtrack for ``He Got Game,'' which tells the story of the
bitter relationship between a young inner-city basketball star,
played by Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks, and his father, a
convict, played by Denzel Washington. Why Copland?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I listen to his music, I hear America, and basketball is
American,'' Lee writes in liner notes to ``Spike Lee Presents: The
Music of Aaron Copland,'' a Sony Classical recording.
</P>
<P>
   So Aaron Copland is now as American as basketball. He could not
have asked for better validation of his ``vague and dubious'' goal
of fostering a recognizable American musical voice. It was not
futile after all.

BISHOPS' DOCUMENT STRIKES AT US CATHOLIC CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle over control of Catholic colleges, which reached a
determining point last week, is one of the most significant events
in the liberal-conservative conflict that has been raging in the
Roman Catholic Church in America for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hue and cry over ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,'' a watershed
document establishing bishops' authority over what is taught in
Catholic universities, is not unrelated to the response to
``Humanae Vitae,'' the papal encyclical issued in 1968 that, most
famously, opposed artificial birth control.
</P>
<P>
   That document started the long-running controversy that has
defined Catholicism in this country _ whether Catholics can dissent
from the teachings of Rome and still remain true to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been Catholic theologians who have helped to provide
the intellectual framework for the debate, promoting the idea that
freedom of conscience should take precedence when Catholics
disagree with the Vatican on issues that are not central tenets of
the faith _ for example, priestly celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   Their pivotal role has not been lost on Rome.
</P>
<P>
   So Pope John Paul II played a pivotal role in ensuring that ``Ex
Corde Ecclesiae,'' which gives bishops the authority to decide who
is fit to teach Catholic theology, was adopted, much to the dismay
of many university administrators and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops gave many impassioned speeches while meeting last
week in Washington, D.C., about adopting the new guidelines as a
way to preserve the Catholic identity of Catholic colleges. But as
much as anything, it seemed, they wanted to make the Vatican happy.
</P>
<P>
   And for John Paul II, the long-discussed ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae''
is crucial to his unyielding campaign _ aided by powerful
conservative allies in the United States _ to rein in an American
Catholic establishment he says has fallen victim to liberal and
democratic notions that threaten Rome's authority.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has made it clear in speeches and writings that the
Roman Catholic Church is not a democracy. Observers say John Paul
cannot comprehend why, in the United States, church teachings on
everything from abortion to women priests are open to public debate
and the subject of opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US bishops are the ones who understand American culture,
who understand American society, and yet they essentially allowed
the Vatican bureaucracy to decide what's best for America,'' said
Peter Beisheim, professor of religious studies at Stonehill
College, a Catholic college in Easton. ``And John Paul II is
someone who seems to have problems with American society.''
</P>
<P>
   That Catholic theologians are singled out by ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae'' (Latin for ``from the heart of the church''), is a
deliberate move, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative bishops and lay groups, such as Catholics United
for the Faith, say many theologians are given too much leash to
promote dissent from church teaching on topics such as celibacy for
priests and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, critics say, theologians are promoting a liberal
line and helping stoke the conflict between a majority of
rank-and-file American Catholics and church fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake here is the truth about what the church
teaches,'' said Philip Gray, vice president of Catholics United for
the Faith in Steubenville, Ohio. ``It's not up to a theologian to
determine what he believes Christ taught. It's up to the theologian
to be faithful to what the church's teaching authority says Christ
taught. If he doesn't, then the faithful can be led into error.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, groups like Catholics United and the Cardinal Newman
Society have been complaining _ sometimes directly to the Vatican _
about theologians who they said were being disloyal to the church.
</P>
<P>
   One particular fear among university administrators, many
theologians, and some bishops is that conservative groups will use
``Ex Corde Ecclesiae'' to target theologians with whom they
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal Newman Society cited ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae'' when it
issued a report criticizing 21 Catholic colleges for inviting
commencement speakers who opposed the church's antiabortion
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Newman Society's reaction to the bishops' vote last week
seemed to suggest that it was prepared to take up the banner of
defending the Vatican against wayward teachers of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can move forward with the hard work of building truly
Catholic campuses . . . and hiring faculty and staff who fully
support the Catholic educational mission,'' said Manuel A. Miranda,
the society's president.
</P>
<P>
   The influence Catholic theologians have over shaping the
Catholic community in the United States is something of which the
Vatican is keenly aware. Since World War II, the US Roman Catholic
population has become better educated, and Catholic colleges have
played a central role in opening academic doors to Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   So Rome has a vested interest in trying, to the extent it can,
to have a say in who teaches theology at the 236 Catholic colleges
in the United States. It is more than a struggle for the soul of US
Catholic higher education, analysts say. It is a struggle for the
soul of Catholicism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, it is a battle the Vatican may have a hard
time winning. Few bishops, even those who agree with the Vatican's
views on the rise of liberal Catholicism in the United States,
would probably be interested in taking on theologians or university
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Not just because doing so would raise questions of academic
freedom, the legal requirements of faculty contracts, and the
weight of tenure. But also because the idea spawned by the fallout
from ``Humanae Vitae'' _ that you can disagree with the church's
fathers and still be a good Catholic _ is now firmly planted in
this country's Catholic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing the Vatican does, including pressuring the bishops
to embrace ``Ex Corde Ecclesiae,'' may be able to uproot it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of it as two planets on a collision course, one that could
rip away moons, rearrange orbits, and reorder gravitational fields.
</P>
<P>
   Now name the planets Al Gore and Bill Bradley and you have the
next stage of their campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps are keenly aware of _ and privately worried about _
any uprooting of their cornerstone vote. But the crisscrossed
constituencies that currently characterize the contest make that
prospect very real.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the biggest single development in the race so far:
Bradley's success in consolidating college-educated voters.
</P>
<P>
   That more than anything else explains his rise to parity with
Gore across New England and in New York. The most recent Boston
Globe poll of New Hampshire, done late last month, shows just how
powerful an indicator education level has become.
</P>
<P>
   Those with a high school diploma or less favor Vice President
Gore 62 percent to 24 percent, while those with a college degree or
graduate degree favor Bradley, the former three-term US senator
from New Jersey, 55 to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far and away the biggest demographic difference,'' says
Gerry Chervinsky, the Globe pollster.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a difference that seems to hold across New England and
into New York. For example, a University of Massachusetts survey of
Bay State voters last monthfound the Democratic race deadlocked at
38 percent for both Gore and Bradley among those with a high school
education or less.
</P>
<P>
   But among voters with a two-year college degree, Bradley led
Gore 42 to 33 percent; among those with a four-year degree,
Bradley's lead increased to 51 to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That vote has proved a powerful base before. The same basic
group almost overnight transformed Gary Hart from asterisk to
avalanche in his 1984 race against Walter F. Mondale for the
Democratic nomination. And it's a cohort that, though split, still
helped catapult Paul Tsongas onto the national stage of Democratic
presidential hopefuls in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we think of as the Bradley surge is largely explained by
how these voters have found Bradley around the time of his
announcement,'' said Ralph Whitehead, who teaches journalism at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He has dubbed this group
``bright collar workers.''
</P>
<P>
   How important will they be? In New England, very.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 percent of New Hampshire residents over age 25 have a
four-year college education or more, but in the last contested
Democratic primary, in 1992, that group cast 50 percent of the
votes. By contrast, 47.5 percent of New Hampshire residents over
age 25 have a high school education or less, but in the same
primary, that group cast only 26 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, Bradley's initial demographic base casts two votes
per voter and Gore's initial base cast half a vote per voter,''
said Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   But now for the disconnect. Hart and Tsongas, notable past
beneficiaries of the bright collar vote, campaigned as neo-liberal
reformers questioning their party's old-line liberal dogma. Thus
they were naturally in sync with a group of voters wary of rigid
ideology, favoring fiscal restraint, and resigned to the discipline
of markets and rapid change of the information economy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had to realize, Tsongas said again and again, that the
economy wasn't an ATM machine that could be tapped _ or taxed _
endlessly to pay for social programs without worrying about
generating new wealth.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly the Bradley message, at least so far. Instead,
he's running as the voice of old-fashioned liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   His hallmark proposal is a near-universal health care plan that,
by the candidate's own estimate, would cost at least $65 billion a
year. Add to that a $10 billion a year plan to fight child poverty,
a $2.6 billion proposal to help working families, and a $1.3
billion plan for agriculture. Then, of course, there's his call to
register all handguns and provide for publicly financed federal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's emerging role as progressive paladin was underscored
last week at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, where he received
the endorsement of Robert Reich, President Clinton's first Labor
secretary and one of the nation's best-known liberals, who said he
was drawn by Bradley's progressive vision.
</P>
<P>
   Crediting Clinton with fixing the economy and turning deficits
to surplus, Reich argued that a strong economy and brimming
treasury now permit bold strokes ``to tackle the nation's
unfinished agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is just the way Bradley sells himself. Asked at the same
event if the nation could really afford such an expensive health
care program, Bradley sounded a certain trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world with a trillion-dollar surplus . . . we can afford
that,'' he insisted. ``If not now, when? If not us, who?''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the nation can _ though the very presumption of a
trillion-dollar surplus assumes the federal government can stay
within spending targets universally seen as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the point is that Bradley's politics are hardly the
fiscally cautious neo-liberal nostrums of previous candidates who
have caught New England's bright collar comet. Instead, his
proposals reflect policy goals that should make him an easy
favorite of the Democrats' traditional base of lower middle-class,
working-class, and minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   But those groups are much more inclined to back Gore, notes
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, while Bradley, ``is more appealing to upscale
Democrats at this point than downscale Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Two things explain the disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Right now this race remains more about atmospherics than issues;
as often as not, Bradley supporters like their candidate less for
specific issue positions than because his mature, thoughtful,
authentic manner seems to make him a perfect antidote to the
Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore's vote, it's one he has largely inherited from
Clinton. But the worry for the vice president has to be this: Are
those constituencies truly for him, or is it simply that they have
yet to focus on what Bradley offers?
</P>
<P>
   It is to Gore's benefit to upset the current characterological
dynamic, which favors Bradley, and refocus the race on issues.
</P>
<P>
   To raise doubts among the college vote, Gore has attacked
Bradley's call for near universal health care coverage as an
extravagance the nation simply can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's a tricky argument for Gore, because opposing
Bradley's plan means arguing that universal coverage _ a goal Gore
embraced back in 1993 and 1994, when the federal government still
had a serious deficit _ is impossible now, in a time of surplus.
(Gore's more modest plan would cover 3 million fewer people.)
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has given his rival an opening by offering a plan
based on (sliding-scale) federal subsidies to allow poor and
modest-income families to purchase health plans. More
cost-effective approaches would be either a single-payer plan or a
mandate requiring employers to insure their workers. But either
would be certain to engender the sort of fierce business opposition
that helped defeat President Clinton's plan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than going either of those routes, Bradley has opted for
an approach that avoids antagonizing business. But because his plan
would subsidize many families that already have health care, it
carries a hefty price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign pegs the cost at about $65 billion a year or
$650 billion over 10 years; Gore argues, with some justification,
that the actual cost would be much higher, at least $1.1 trillion
over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   That expense presents a target for Gore. In the Oct. 27
Dartmouth debate and since, he has offered a not-so-subtle
class-based cost/benefit criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley spends the entire surplus on health care, Gore warns,
there will be no money left for other programs, such as saving
Medicare or improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers have to add up,'' Gore warned when he and Bradley
debated. ``Spending more than the entire surplus and then piling on
top of that proposals that may sound great but for which there is
no money is something that ought to be looked at very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Gore has tried to reinforce his black and Latino
support, which might be attracted to Bradley's anti-poverty
proposal and his focus on racial harmony, by attacking Bradley's
plan to replace Medicaid with a subsidy that would let poor
families buy private health-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   In an attack reminiscent of the fear-mongering ``Medi-scare''
campaign Clinton ran in 1996, Gore has accused his rival of trying
to ``tear down'' Medicaid in a way that would leave minorities
``out in the cold.'' In Boston on Thursday, Gore continued his
attack, saying Bradley's plan could spell disaster for those who
depend on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen when the near collision comes?
</P>
<P>
   Neither side knows _ and each is nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's health care plan wipes out a hard-won surplus in one
fell swoop,'' says Doug Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire press
secretary. ``That does not paint a pretty picture for Tsongas
deficit hawks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's camp thinks it will prove easier for their man to
snaffle Gore's less affluent voters with the enticement of big new
benefits than for Gore to make inroads into Bradley's
college-educated crowd, who probably have a fairly clear taken on
Gore already.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they tune into the campaign, they will see a candidate who
has an agenda of big solutions that speak directly to their
interests,'' says Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Who will prevail? It depends in large part on how effectively
each candidate makes his argument. Which is why it's worth noting
that so far, Gore has done a better job raising doubts about
Bradley's program than Bradley has in assuaging them.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than two months left till New Hampshire's Feb.1
primary, one thing is certain: By the time voters cast their
ballots, they will have been given plenty of reasons to rethink
their original preference _ no matter who that was.

THE STORY OF `JOE THE KING' IS REALLY FRANK WHALEY'S OWN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Whaley, writer and director of ``Joe the King,'' is at the
Lenox Hotel during the recent Boston Film Festival, about to
discuss his directorial debut. After shaking hands, a visitor
comments that with ``Joe the King,'' Whaley has made the feel-good
movie of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Set in hell, yeah,'' he says, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   All right, ``Joe the King'' is not the feel-good movie of the
year. It is a youth movie unlike any other, although it bears a
resemblance to the grittier aspects of ``Outside Providence.'' But
it is not a sweet coming-of-age movie. There is no hot teen sex, no
gross bodily fluids, no cheap yuks. There are no ``Dawson's Creek''
or ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' stars making the leap to movies. No
sentimentality. The young actors _ including Joe, played by Noah
Fleiss _ are relative unknowns. The name adult actors _ Val Kilmer,
Ethan Hawke, John Leguizamo _ are supporting characters.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie was not made for kids, Whaley says, ``I thnk
it's good for kids to see a movie like this. A lot of movies are
really frivolous. They don't show kids in an intelligent way. This
guy, Joe, is heroic in that he's able to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is highly autobiographical. Set in the 1970s, it
concerns the difficult life and trying times of Joe, a frequent
truant and budding juvenile delinquent who is on the path to a
career in crime and a life spent mostly in jail. The son of an
alcoholic father and a wayward mother, Joe is not necessarily an
evil kid. In doing what he thinks needs to be done to get by, he
makes some bad choices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Whaley was at the Sundance Film Festival,
nervously anticipating the screening of his film. ``I didn't show
any (advance) footage, so no one knew what the movie was about. (I
thought) the only way to sell it was to keep it quiet and make an
event out of it at Sundance,'' Whaley recalled. ``Before the
screening started, it was like Elvis was in there. They were
pushing and shoving to get in; every agent in town wanted to talk
to me; everybody wanted to have dinner with me. And then, once the
screening started, within the first 15 minutes, about 40 people
walked out. I was so distraught. A good friend of my brother's
(Robert, who has a role in the movie) was there and I was crying,
because it was my whole life'' up on screen ``and he said, `You
have got to stand behind your work and think about the people who
stayed, not the people who left. There are people in the audience
who were really affected by it, and those are the people you made
it for. So why are you being a baby?' But you don't see that. You
always remember the bad reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he says he realized that ``no matter what kind of movie
you make, what kind of painting you make, what kind of book you
make, not everybody's going to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whaley may have gotten the last laugh, because ``Joe the
King'' was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and shared the Waldo
Salt Screenwriting Award at Sundance. But the movie wasn't released
until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a movie of high dramatic conflict. ``I took a very
pure approach to writing,'' says Whaley. ``I did not think of plot.
I told the story from one point of view, where he travels down this
path. People come in here and there, but he keeps going.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for laughs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The film begins in a classroom where it's
tell-your-peers-what-your-dad-does day. Young Joe (played by Peter
Tambakis) is paddled bare-bottom by his teacher because he doesn't
want to reveal that his father is the school janitor. You might be
thinking this movie will evolve into a dark comedy, but shortly you
realize this isn't a story to be played for laughs. It hits you _
``like a ton of bricks,'' finishes Whaley. ``Although I tried to
infuse it it with several humor sprinkles throughout to mitigate
the darkness. I know just from watching a film that if it gets too
heavy, then the audience starts to go `Nahhhhh.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters all come from my childhood. I was Joe. Those
other two guys were my friends. We were loser kids but we kind of
found each other. I don't know what happened to them; they were
ghosts of my past. The father (in the movie) is actually a Disney
version. My father was a tough guy, a drunk. That was our home
life, pretty decrepit, pretty impoverished, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley's father is dead. His mother is alive, but Whaley says he
doesn't expect or want her to see ``Joe the King'' even though,
somewhat parodoxically, ``it is sort of a love letter to her,
because I look at her now and, as I get older I see this even more,
she is almost really heroic in that she kept a roof over our heads.
I have two sisters and a brother, and we are all adults, we are
working, we are happy, and so if not for her, we would all be dead
or in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley, who had many run-ins with the law before he was 18, says
he never ended up in reform school or jail. ``I just always talked
my way out of it. It was mostly shoplifting and there was a moment
where I sort of began the process of graduating to higher crimes. I
got in with a crowd that was into body parts, cars, and chop shops.
Easy, quick money. I learned to hot-wire, stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate took a curious twist. ``At the same moment, I found my
brother had joined the drama club in school because there was a
girl that he liked, and in those days I did everything that he did.
So I said, `I'm joining drama club too,' and I joined the drama
club, as I had a crush on a girl in there. It wasn't because of
acting; I didn't understand acting. I'd never seen a play, but for
the first time in my life, at 16-17, I didn't feel alienated. There
were people there whom I related to. I got a lot of attention. I
was such a shy, introspective, quiet kid and I finally found
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who headed the drama club challenged him to think
about his future. She had him look into an Education Opportunity
Program, a program for inner-city kids championed by President
Jimmy Carter, and Whaley was selected for it. He got a stipend,
books, and an education, studying theater at Albany State
University and graduating in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' he says, of the educational experience, ``saved my life.
If it wasn't given to me, I wouldn't have gone. I was on a
collision course. The judge in a family court said, `I'm not
kidding you, I'll give you one last chance and if doesn't work out,
I'm sorry.' I didn't want to go to jail because a friend of mine
did go to jail and got beaten up and raped.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Flawed but likable &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This, more or less, is Joe's life in the movie _ without the
going-to-college happy ending. Joe is sometimes likable, sometimes
not, but Whaley says ``for all his flaws'' he is sympathetic. ``The
only way the film works is, on one level, they must want to stay
with this guy. And I think because of what he looks like and
conveys in his eyes, they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Joe's criminal behavior morally justifiable?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not morally,'' says Whaley, ``because it is wrong to
steal. There are consequences to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley adds, ``I got lucky (finding Fleiss) and in that I saw a
lot of actors and Noah wasn't what I was looking for physically _ I
wanted somebody not so handsome and he was a good-looking kid _ but
he was very well behaved and memorized his script in a limited
amount of time. We needed an actor who was prepared and disciplined
who could also work with these other adult actors.'' And, he adds,
who could handle some pretty rough and gritty scenes.
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly, is Joe the king of? ``As I was shooting, I was
looking for a beautiful title and somewhere along the line `Joe the
King' came to me, it wasn't referenced to anything, although we did
throw a line in later about it,'' Whaley says. ``If I was to use a
metaphor, I would say Joe is the king of this little domain
underneath his house.'' (Joe stashes his prime treasure there,
recordings that he bought with stolen money to give to his mother.)
</P>
<P>
   A Syracuse native, Whaley, 36, has acted professionally for 15
years and has been in ``The Doors,'' ``Hoffa,'' ``Swimming With
Sharks,'' ``Reservoir Dogs,'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
He also appeared in the recent TV miniseries ``Shake, Rattle, and
Roll.'' But ``Joe the King'' was germinating for years. Whaley says
as an actor, writer, and director he's drawn to ``dead-end guys,
blue-collar guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley met Kilmer on the set of ``The Doors'' _ Kilmer played
Jim Morrison, Whaley played guitarist Robby Krieger, and the two
remained pals. He and Hawke, who plays Joe's guidance counselor,
are friends who met on the set of ``A Midnight Clear'' in 1991.
John Leguizamo, co-executive producer, plays Jorge, a busboy at the
restaurant where Joe works. Kilmer plays Joe's semi-bloated,
disheveled father. Whaley says Kilmer shed his glam image, put on
some pounds, and transformed himself into someone who ``destroyed
his life, destroyed his body, even if at one time he was a
striking, charismatic guy.'' The film, which cost $1.2 million, was
shot in 28 days on location on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   How does Whaley define success for the movie? ``If it plays in
(a small New York theater) for a couple of months, long enough for
all my friends to see it,'' says Whaley.
</P>
<P>
   Will it play in the malls and multiplexes? ``I doubt it,'' he
says, ``though I would love it to. `American Beauty' is playing in
malls . . .''

HIV MAY BE WITHIN IMMUNE SYSTEM'S CONTROL

 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A small but remarkable experiment is showing that some
AIDS patients may be able to control the disease on their own when
treatment with potent drugs is halted intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment represents the next conceptual push in AIDS
research, now that specialists are convinced it won't be possible
to eradicate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from patients'
cells with forseeable treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital say they were
highly encouraged by the results when they repeatedly stopped
triple-drug therapy in HIV-infected volunteers. They described
preliminary findings from two such patients Friday at a scientific
meeting in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus came back each time the drugs were stopped, but
in both cases, there were clear signs that the patients' immune
systems were battling to control the emergent virus, with
increasing success. In effect, unleashing the virus in a controlled
fashion may act like a vaccine booster shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that patients' reexposure to their own virus has
potentially the same effect that a vaccine would have,'' Dr. Eric
Rosenberg, who presented the new data, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver is called ``structured interrupted therapy,'' and
the ultimate hope is that it will allow at least some HIV-infected
patients _ those treated very early in the course of their
infection _ to be weaned permanently from antiviral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also expect the experiment will teach them what it
takes, immunologically speaking, to keep HIV in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic _ in fact, quite certain _ that we will get a
much better understanding of what's needed for viral control,''
said Dr. Bruce Walker, director of the MGH's AIDS Research Center.
``That will guide vaccine development.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to know if any AIDS patients will be able to throw
away their antiviral drugs. Still, the signs are encouraging enough
that other leading AIDS laboratories have embarked on similar
experiments or are gearing up to do them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structured interrupted therapy is what everybody's excited
about and working on,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal
government's leading AIDS researcher. ``We and a number of labs
have protocols to put people deliberately on intermittent
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fauci cautioned, ``we need to be really careful not to
make definitive statements until we see a trend. We need a lot more
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The MGH doctors have another 18 volunteers lined up to do
interrupted therapy. They stressed that HIV-infected patients
should not stop treatment outside of studies, because close
monitoring of viral loads and immune responses are crucial to keep
the virus within safe bounds and avoid the emergence of
drug-resistant viral strains.
</P>
<P>
   The new experiments were inspired by the striking observation
that some HIV-infected patients have controlled the virus all on
their own. One such patient, Robert Massie, is an Episcopal priest,
environmentalist, and former candidate for lieutenant governor of
Massachusetts who acquired the AIDS virus in 1978 from an infusion
of anti-hemophilia factor. Massie has been intensely studied by the
MGH researchers; his HIV-specific immune response ``is the
strongest we've ever seen,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Another inspiration is the so-called Berlin patient, a
30-year-old German man who has become an icon of hope in the AIDS
community. He took himself off anti-AIDS drugs in December, 1996,
after several on-and-off cycles of therapy, and has remained well
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him today and he's in perfect health,'' his physician,
Dr. Heako Jessen, said in a telephone interview last Thursday.
``His virus is controlled and his immune system is normal, perhaps
because this on-and-off therapy boosted his HIV-specific
immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessen, an independent practitioner who collaborates with the
MGH researchers, has interrupted drug therapy in 10 patients this
year. He reports longer and longer intervals before the virus
returns, some reaching three months so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the MGH, seven patients in all have stopped taking their
anti-HIV therapy for varying lengths of time, although Rosenberg
presented data Friday from only the first two at a meeting of the
Infectious Disease Society of America. To qualify, all such
patients must have been diagnosed very early _ during the flu-like
acute illness that usually occurs within weeks of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Rosenberg have found that such acutely treated
patients retain strong immune responses directed at HIV, especially
among so-called T-helper cells that orchestrate the entire immune
response symphony. Once patients have been infected for months or
years, they almost always have lost such potent HIV-specific immune
responses, even if they regain responses against tuberculosis,
tetanus, cytomegalovirus, and other bugs.
</P>
<P>
   So far the results of the MGH experiments are tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Patient 1, a 32-year-old Boston man, initially went off therapy
last July after 17 months on antiviral drugs that had suppressed
blood levels of HIV below the limits of detection.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later HIV began to show itself, rising slowly to
about 17,000 viral copies per milliliter of blood (a thousandth of
a liter). This was only a fraction of the 280,000 virus particles
that this patient had when he was first diagnosed, but Rosenberg
and Walker decided to start drug therapy again lest the virus get
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were encouraged by the fact that the virus had
returned slowly. When most AIDS patients stop multidrug treatments
(for instance, because of another illness or intolerance to the
drugs), the virus comes roaring back to pretreatment levels within
days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Patient 1 again stopped therapy in early January of this year
because of a liver ailment. This time something interesting
happened. After three weeks without drugs, HIV showed itself in the
patient's bloodstream, steadily mounting until there were 38,000
viral copies per milliliter. But just as the doctors were preparing
to start therapy again, his viral ``load'' began to fall
dramatically _ to 6,000 copies, then 400 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing it all on his own,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Patient 1 started taking antiviral drugs again when he was able.
Eight weeks later, he interrupted treatment again _ and this time,
his immune system kept the virus at low levels for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a gray zone of good but not perfect control,''
Rosenberg said. For now, Patient 1 is back on triple-drug therapy,
but he and Rosenberg plan another drug ``holiday'' soon to see if
his anti-HIV immune response is even more effective the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Patient 2, a 40-year-old man, also seems to show that the immune
system can be spurred into an effective attack against HIV by early
treatment and on-and-off drug cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with acute HIV syndrome in April, 1997, Patient 2 had
an initial viral load of more than 1 million copies. Drug treatment
quickly brought that down to undetectable levels, or less than 50
copies, where it remained for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment was interrupted last January 28, but within three
weeks Patient 2's viral levels had spiked to more than 100,000
copies. Drugs again brought that back down below detectable levels.
</P>
<P>
   When Patient 2 stopped taking drugs the second time, on June 2,
the virus remained hidden for two weeks but then crept back into
his blood at a low level _ about 200 copies. Over the ensuing
months, the viral level fluctuated in the hundreds to low
thousands, never rising above 6,500 copies.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, Walker noted, ``this fellow was at a viral
level which the US Public Health Service guidelines say would not
need to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   The MGH researchers are encouraged not only by the viral levels
in these patients, but by their rebounding immune responses to HIV.
Despite his good response, Patient 2, like Patient 1, decided to do
another eight-week round of drug treatment in the hope that a third
``booster shot'' of HIV ``will be the charm,'' as Walker put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four months off drugs was really liberating,'' Patient 2 said
in an interview. ``But I decided to go back on to see if at one of
these points my natural immunity will keep it in check and I won't
have to take drugs at all. But I know I'm in uncharted territory.''

THE PLANET'S TURN FOR THE BETTER 
</HEADLINE>

 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Predicting the fate of the Earth has long been a
gloomy business, a profession where bad things only seem to get
worse over time. From books like The Population Bomb to The End of
Nature, ecological pundits of the past 40 years have forecast a
dark future of pollution, extinction, and growing health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the 20th century comes to a close, some leading
researchers and policymakers see evidence that the world's
environmental tide may be about to turn. Already, the ``population
explosion'' is slowing down, as is the growth rate of gases that
cause global warming and the hole in the ozone layer. In western
nations, air, water, and land are getting cleaner, and even China
is showing new interest in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Though the problems can't be minimized _ more than 5,000 plant
and animal species worldwide are threatened with extinction _
environmental thinkers gathered for a major conference on the
planet's future at Columbia University last week said the emerging
successes offer hope for nature in the 21st century, like blades of
grass growing through cracks in the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all sorts of evidence . . . that things are working a
little bit better with a little less pounding on the environment,''
said William Clark, an authority on environmental issues at Harvard
University and a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ``genius
grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark predicted that, by the late 21st century, the global
population may finally level off, ending 200 years of dramatic
growth that has fuelled a vast increase in environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For your children, each passing year will add fewer people
than it did the year before. That is a statement that could not
have been made from this podium any other time in the last 1,000
years,'' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Equally striking was the optimism of James Hansen, director of
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the man who, perhaps
more than anyone else, popularized the issue of global warming with
alarming Congressional testimony in 1988 that emissions from cars
and power plants are causing the planet to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hansen predicted that the next 10 years will be the
hottest in US history, he was encouraged that releases of so-called
``greenhouse gases'' are growing much more slowly than 20 years
ago. Already, he said, the slower growth has delayed by 50 years
the date at which greenhouse gases in the air will double their
pre-industrial levels. ``I would prefer to think we have turned the
corner, and we have the potential to make greenhouse gas growth
rates decrease even further in the future,'' Hansen declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, assessing the health of an entire planet is a
complicated task confounded by conflicting information, and
optimism was by no means universal among the historians and
scientists at Columbia. However, Mikhail Gorbachev, the former
leader of the Soviet Union, seemed to capture the mood when he
suggested that humans can solve even the worst problems _ if they
choose to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has to face a difficult challenge but, as
recent history has proved, walls of difficulty, like the Berlin
Wall, can fall,'' said Gorbachev, who sent his remarks to be read
at the conference after he was unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The thread of optimism at the State of the Planet conference,
held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Columbia's Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory, is ironic, coming as it does at the end of a
century that, by many measures, did unprecedented harm to the
natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The world population grew almost fourfold in the 20th century,
to 6 billion, creating sprawling cities that erased the natural
landscape and sucked up natural resources on an astonishing scale.
Humans dammed up so much water that geophysicists say it has
perceptibly altered the way the planet rotates.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of oil and the modern chemical industry gave humans the
power to send pollution to the far corners of the globe. The
burning of oil and other fossil fuels increased the atmospheric
concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide by 30 percent,
while industry introduced 70,000 synthetic chemicals to the
environment, some of them deadly toxins such as dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   But, even as environmental problems intensified, promising
changes, especially in the industrialized west, foreshadowed a
recovery, said Jesse Ausubel, director of the Program for the Human
Environment at Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   For example, food production exploded in the 20th century,
allowing a single hectare of US farmland to feed 80 people where it
had fed only three before. Tens of thousands of acres of less
productive farmland were abandoned, bringing forests back in places
such as Massachusetts, which had been nearly treeless in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, US water withdrawals have been dropping since
the 1970s, said Ausubel, often due to simple plumbing changes. In
Boston, for example, an aggressive program of pipe repair has
reduced the city's water use to its lowest level since the 1950s,
eliminating the need to divert water from the Connecticut River to
Boston's reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as the US moved away from smokestack industries toward
a technology-based economy, industrial pollution has dropped
steadily, spurred on by increasingly strict environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   These improvements haven't come to the world's developing
nations, from Central America to China, where political leaders
often seek to emulate western-style industrial development, with
all its attendant pollution from coal dust in the air to oil in
drinking water supplies. Developing countries are now the fastest
growing source of greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   But, even in developing nations, the 20th century saw some
material improvements as infant mortality rates dropped, literacy
rose, and real incomes tripled. To be sure, 800 million people
still don't have enough to eat, but Maurice Strong, secretary
general of the landmark 1992 UN Conference on Environment and
Development in Rio De Janeiro, said he sees signs that developing
nation leaders understand that economic growth shouldn't come at
the expense of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see an immense surge in new interest in the environment and
sustainable development movement'' in China, said Strong, who
recently discussed the environmental crisis there with Premier Zhu
Rongji. ``Not because they have particularly listened to our
rhetoric, but because they have experienced (environmental
degradation) firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the buoyance at Columbia hinged on faith in
technology to produce environmental solutions that don't derail the
booming global economy. Speakers called for new technologies that
provide cheap, clean power, such as fuel cells, as well as
cost-effective ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest threat to prosperity is the rejection of
science,'' warned Rockefeller's Ausubel.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that the planet was never in as serious shape as
some have contended, because they always underestimated human
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purveyors of doom have discovered how to profit from
creating an endless series of false alarms,'' said William O'Keefe,
president of the 400-member American Petroleum Institute, noting
that the world is nowhere near running out of oil despite repeated
predictions to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark of Harvard argued that much of the environmental
progress in the west might not have happened without the public
outrage generated by authors such as Carson and Ehlrich, even if
they over-stated their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our Jeremiahs,'' said Clark, referring to the gloomy
Biblical prophet. ``They are why anyone listens to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a senior environmental official at BP Amoco, one of the
biggest oil companies, conceded that public pressure is a major
reason that his industry, one of the biggest polluters of the
century, is trying to become ``greener.'' London-based BP has
voluntarily committed to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases
by 10 percent, and the company is investing heavily in cleaner
energy sources such as solar power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reinventing the company. There's a lot of new thinking
going on,'' said Paul Rutter, BP's environmental technology leader.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent environmentalist, Lester Brown, president of the
Worldwatch Institute, sees the changing attitudes in the oil
industry as evidence that the world is on the edge of an
environmental revolution where corporate executives ``sound like
spokespeople for Greenpeace,'' and the world finally addresses
fundamental environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there are now some clear signs that the world
is in the early stages of a major shift in environmental
consciousness,'' wrote Brown in a much-discussed essay earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Brown is right, however, the world has its work cut out
for it. Though greenhouse gases aren't building up as fast as they
did 20 years ago, they could still raise the Earth's average
temperature by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, something that
Columbia University climate researcher Wallace Broecker calls
``poking the angry beast with a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more and more people are placing themselves in harm's
way if global warming produces higher sea levels and more violent
coastal storms as many predict. Already, growing populations along
rivers and the sea has helped increase the worldwide damage in
floods and other natural disasters from $2 billion to $92 billion
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The question, said one speaker after another, is whether
humanity is ready to do what's necessary to preserve the
environment. The issue, they said, is less scientific than it is a
question of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hass, the US poet laureate from 1995 to 1997, seemed to
sense both the promise and the peril of the situation in the poem
he wrote for the conference, ``State of the Planet:''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The earth and its heated atmosphere, its cargo
</P>
<P>
   of everything alive, is swimming in a sea we hardly understand
</P>
<P>
   Our own primitive astronomical maps of. The young know this
story
</P>
<P>
   From the disaster films they flock to see. Because we're humans,
there's always a love story in it somewhere,
</P>
<P>
   Even as the ship goes down. In fact, we are capable
</P>
<P>
   Of sending the ship down to intensify the story. . .
</P>
<P>
   Blessings on the ship. Terror for the ship, and pity for it
</P>
<P>
   And its hapless crew. For her, standing at the prow,
</P>
<P>
   Our lucky charm, and hope, and heiroglyph,
</P>
<P>
   The riddle we have to interpret, the future we have to answer
to.''

WHY STORMS ROTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. If storms rotate in opposite directions on each side of the
equator, what happens when one crosses the equator?
</P>
<P>
   B.L., Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They never do. Blame it on Coriolis.
</P>
<P>
   That's French Scientist Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis, who in 1835
figured out a way to mathematically explain the way the rotation of
the earth makes large weather systems spin in different directions
above and below the equator.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you're standing at the North Pole. You shoot a missile
straight at Dallas. But as the missile heads south, Dallas is
moving. The earth is spinning west to east. The people of Dallas
luck out. The missile misses to the west. From behind, it looks
like the missile curved to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Now stand in Dallas and launch your missile toward the North
Pole. Which way will it curve? TRICK QUESTION ALERT! If you guessed
to the left, the west, you're.......WRONG! Since Dallas itself is
moving to the east, to the right, anything launched from Dallas
will carry inertia that will also throw its course off to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's go to the southern hemisphere. A missile launched from
the South Pole at, say Rio de Janiero, will curve to the left as it
heads north. And a missile launched from Rio, heading south, has
that west-to-east inertia from the earth's rotation. From behind
it, that missile will be grabbed by that inertia and curve to its
left.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force bends things to
the right. Below the equator, they bend to the left. That's why
storms rotate counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and the
clockwise in the south.
</P>
<P>
   But the equator is a Coriolis-free zone. The Coriolis force
doesn't exist there. Imagine you're standing directly on top of a
spinning top. Your vertical axis and the axis through the top are
pointed in the same direction. You both have the same motion. You
spin like the top, and get very dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   But now imagine you can stand on the equator of the top, the
wide part in the middle. You're sticking straight out, horizontal,
parallel with the floor, perpendicular to the axis of the top. It
will carry you along as it goes round and round. You're standing
still, just being carried along for the ride. You're not dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   The top is the earth. The closer you are to the poles, the more
aligned you are with the vertical axis, and the more you spin. The
closer you are to the equator, the less you spin. The Coriolis
force is strongest at the poles, gone at the equator.
</P>
<P>
   So a hurricane heading toward the equator loses its spin. No
hurricane has ever gotten to within ten degrees of the equator,
according to the National Hurricane Center. And if one ever got to
the equator, it would break apart before it could ever get across
and start spinning the other way.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you know that bit about water in a toilet or sink
spinning in opposite directions in the northern and southern
hemispheres? Totally bogus. You just have a left or right-handed
sink or toilet bowl or drain. Coriolis only affects very big
systems, like weather.

HOLIDAY MOMENTS TO DIGEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pie-eating contest starts as soon as the ravaged turkey is
cleared away. You know the pie- eating contest. It's a Thanksgiving
moment, not a Kodak moment, unless a disciple of Diane Arbus
happens to be behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try a piece of my pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't eat another bite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to try my pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe just a tiny slice.''
</P>
<P>
   So you try her pie, and then you have to try somebody else's
pie, and then somebody else's, and they all want to know what you
think of their pies. You have to lie because you can't tell them
the truth, i.e., ``I think I may be sick.'' It would ruin the
Thanksgiving moment.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell has a lot to answer for. He enshrined the myth
of Thanksgiving in that famous Saturday Evening Post cover, the
happy family gathered around a turkey the size of Mount Rushmore.
Before he created that scene, people used to feel lucky to have a
chicken on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stakes have escalated to the point where everybody wants
a bird that will feed the starving millions. Which means that
somebody (guess who?) has to get up at 5 a.m. and wrestle the thing
into the oven. There is nothing that will get your holiday,
so-called, off to a more festive start than rising before dawn and
trying to get a grip on a cold, slippery 23-pound turkey. Talk
about a Thanksgiving moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare man who will find himself dealing with a giant raw
turkey in the hours before sunrise on Thanksgiving morning. That's
because Thanksgiving is for men, the way Christmas and Halloween
are for children. It's a sexual stereotype, I know, and I should be
ashamed of myself. But it's a stereotype because it's true.
</P>
<P>
   It's a day when men gather and do what men do, all the
traditional male Thanksgiving things. They go to high school
football games. They watch football on TV. They play touch
football. They talk about football. They drink beer. They smoke
cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Men want to help on Thanksgiving, but their timing is off. ``Can
I help?'' they ask, just as you've finished doing whatever it is
they might have helped you do if you'd known where to find them.
</P>
<P>
   But men do carve, and everybody knows that carving is the most
important job on Thanksgiving. It's a lost art, really. And if it
goes wrong, and the turkey ends up all crumbly, looking like
something that belongs in the cat's dish, it's not his fault. It's
your fault because you didn't cook it right. It makes for another
Thanksgiving moment to treasure for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Like the year your sister-in-law microwaved the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And the annual unveiling of your aunt's Jell-O mold. You can't
avoid it. No use protesting that you're allergic to molds.
</P>
<P>
   Or the first _ and last _ time your brother-in-law insisted that
you deep-fry the turkey whole, outdoors, in a vat of boiling fat,
the way they do it back home in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget the Martha Stewart-inspired Thanksgiving at
your cousin's house? How many miniature pumpkins are one too many?
</P>
<P>
   Or the year of the tofurkey _ when your kids suddenly decided
they were vegetarians?
</P>
<P>
   And there was that Thanksgiving you tried a recipe from The New
York Times, an easy way to cook a turkey in no time at all, in a
500-degree oven. All the smoke alarms went off, and the fire
department came and carried the smoldering turkey out of the house.
Later, you went out for Chinese food. What a good idea. The Chinese
food, that is. And the burning turkey, too.

`OPEN HOUSE' PITCH OMITS 2 KEY WORDS: TIME SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all heard the pitch: For just a little bit of your time,
you'll receive an assortment of fabulous gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Charves got the pitch recently from a woman named Holly at
the Colonial Acres Resort in West Yarmouth, Mass., a time-share
operation, although no mention of that was made in the pitch. In
return for coming to an ``open house,'' Charves was promised two
free roundtrip airline tickets to a destination of her choice from
a list including Florida, California, Hawaii, and the Caribbean; a
free three-day, two-night getaway to any of 45 US cities; and gift
certificates to the Red Lobster or Olive Garden restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Charves was skeptical _ ``I'm no idiot,'' she said _ but she
thought a trip with her children to Cape Cod and two free airline
tickets would be a productive outing.
</P>
<P>
   One of Charves's daughters has ataxia telangiectasia, a deadly
genetic disease that afflicts only about 650 children in the United
States. Charves wants to raise awareness of the disease, and
planned to donate the airline tickets to raise money for research.
</P>
<P>
   Charves said she asked Holly repeatedly whether the tickets were
really free and whether she had to buy anything to get them. She
even asked for assurances in writing and Holly sent her the script
of her pitch. ``It says flat out, two free airline tickets,''
Charves said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tickets weren't really free. The time-share industry may
be gaining respectability with the entry of big-name companies such
as Marriott, Hyatt, and Disney, but many resorts continue to
deceive would-be customers into thinking they are getting something
valuable for their time.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's trade group admits that the No. 1 consumer
complaint about time shares is deceptive marketing practices
(including promotional sweepstakes contests, as we wrote about last
week). And the Massachusetts attorney general has received several
dozen complaints about time-share resorts since 1996, including
four involving Colonial Acres.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McCauley, director of marketing for Colonial Acres, said
he goes to great lengths to treat would-be customers fairly. He
said the gifts he offers consumers have a retail value of about
$550. And to make sure his telephone solicitors don't mislead
people (they get paid based on how many people they bring to the
resort), he has a manager follow up with each person who agrees to
a visit. A letter is also sent to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is spelled out for them,'' McCauley said. ``We try
to do everything the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charves said she never received a follow-up letter or phone
call. What was sent _ the script that Holly had read _ showed how
deceptive the pitch is.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of a time-share presentation. ``All we are
going to do is walk you around the facilities and show you our
beach and models in the hopes that if you like what you see, you'll
come back and stay with us in the future,'' the pitch said.
</P>
<P>
   McCauley said ``time share'' is not mentioned because consumers
have the wrong idea about it. ``The words have the connotation of a
skull and crossbones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   The two free roundtrip airline tickets, offered by a company
called Fly Free America, are an homage to semantics. They are free
only if you spend a certain number of days at a resort in the
destination city and pay the resort's top room rate. But at those
prices, the tickets are hardly free.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you want to fly to Hawaii and stay at the Waikiki Joy.
Using Fly Free America, two people could fly to Hawaii for free in
March as long as they stay a minimum of 13 nights at the Waikiki
Joy at $280 a night. That works out to $3,640, not including room
or departure taxes and transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Ann Bellanti at Colpitts Travel in Dedham, Mass. was able to
book the same trip on American Airlines and a suite at the Joy for
$2,885, with transfers and taxes included, for a savings of more
than 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trips closer to home and of shorter duration are more
cost-effective, but still no bargain. Using Fly Free America, a
four-night stay at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando in
February would cost $1,400, not including taxes and transfers.
Bellanti was able to book the same trip on Delta for $1,323 with
taxes, transfers, and a free shuttle to Disney World included.
</P>
<P>
   The free three-day, two-night getaway to any of 45 destinations
doesn't include transportation and it hinges on a second time-share
solicitation. According to Mini-Vacations Inc., the company running
the program, guests select a destination and then are booked at a
motel there. The motel bill is paid for by a nearby time-share
resort, which then targets the travelers for another time-share
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The one gift with no strings attached was the $30 gift
certificate to the Red Lobster or Olive Garden restaurants. Charves
used her certificate at Olive Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For Colonial Acres, the restaurant certificate was probably the
most expensive gift offered. The company that owns Red Lobster and
Olive Garden sells the certificates to companies like Colonial
Acres at a 10 to 15 percent discount. Mini-Vacations Inc. said it
charges $3 for its getaway packages and Fly Free America charges
$7.50 to $10, depending on how many trips are purchased. The
estimated cost of the Colonial Acres pitch to the time-share
resort: About $40.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Phone bill aggravation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's incredible to us that a long-distance phone company called
International Plus, which targets Asian immigrants, has a slogan
with the words ``simple solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one case involving a Somerville couple who moved
here from Taiwan, this company refused the most simple solution to
a complicated problem that it created.
</P>
<P>
   Before contacting us, Hong Wang, 37, a hospital researcher,
tried for several weeks to resolve a $50 billing problem he had
with International Plus, also known as NOS Communications. After
canceling the carrier because of bad phone connections, he was hit
with an array of unannounced extra fees.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Las Vegas, told him the extra fees were
imposed because low calling rates are promised on the condition
that he stay with the company for six months and meet minimum
monthly usage requirements. Wang said he and his wife were never
told about these rules when a Chinese-speaking telemarketer sold
them on the plan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest bill, a 24-minute call to Taiwan, for example, was
recalculated at a rate of $1.74 a minute, instead of 29 cents a
minute. He was also hit with a $10 monthly management fee.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang declined to pay, the company threatened to take his
case to a collections agency that could begin legal action.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang asked for our help, we agreed to step in, largely
because we have long suspected that firms specializing in ethnic
marketing may take advantage of these new-to-America consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, we didn't have much luck either. After placing
numerous phone calls to the company's 800 phone number, it declined
to address the Wang case with a reporter and refused to give out
the phone number of company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Tuesday, after obtaining the headquarters phone
number through an Internet site, we reached a company attorney who
intervened. Wang was told later by the company he would get about
$50 in credit for the disputed fees. In the future, Wang said he
will be far more suspicious of telemarketing calls and demand all
rules in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we learned our lesson the hard way,'' Wang said.

BLEDSOE BEING HUNG OUT TO DRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They may as well take the No. 11 off his jersey and put
a big bull's-eye on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe is now the No. 1 target in the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a coincidence that the Miami Dolphins' defense
pummeled the Patriots' Pro Bowl quarterback, taking control of
their important AFC East game Sunday and going on to a 27-17
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami coaching staff spent last week looking at the film of
the New York Jets banging Bledsoe around last Monday night, and
decided to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked up some things from the Jets and put them into our
package,'' said assistant coach Dave Wannstedt. ``If you want to
beat these guys, you have to pressure Bledsoe and make some plays
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we told our guys. We have to make some plays
downfield, and we can do that if we can make him force the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened. Bledsoe threw five interceptions, and it
could have been eight.
</P>
<P>
   Once again he repeatedly was knocked to the ground. He has been
knocked down more than any quarterback in the league this season,
because opponents realize that if you stop Bledsoe, you stop the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins defense was magnificent. It gave up just 10 points
and was stung just twice (Miami quarterback Damon Huard gave the
Patriots their first 7 points by tossing a bad lateral that turned
into a fumble inside his 10).
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's 68-yard scoring bomb to Shawn Jefferson in the third
quarter, and Kevin Faulk's 43-yard run that set up a field goal in
the second were the only New England offensive plays of any
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe had just 60 yards passing deep into the third quarter.
At the start of the fourth quarter Monday night against the Jets,
he had just 88 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams in a row now have taken the Patriots' regular offense
apart. They didn't do anything against the Jets until they went
into a no-huddle, shotgun formation last week, and they went into
that mode out of their regular T formation by the third period
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defensive backs did a great job of covering the
Patriots' receivers. In certain passing situations they did
something novel, having a speed cornerback run with tight end Ben
Coates, who usually has a bigger safety or linebacker assigned to
him. Twice under pressure Bledsoe tried to force the ball into
Coates and was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   This game followed a similar pattern to the Jets loss. New York
vowed to take it to the Patriots physically, and the Dolphins were
urged by coach Jimmy Johnson to do the same thing. Johnson
predicted that if they beat up the Patriots for three quarters, New
England would be worn down by the fourth. He was correct.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling last week in Buffalo with one of the worst
offensive outputs in team history, the Miami coaches decided to cut
down the number of plays in their game plan to help Huard. At times
against the Bills he seemed confused and uncertain. They thought by
giving him less to do, they might get more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we need 21 points to win this one,'' Wannstedt said
before the game. ``Our offense has to do something early to give
our defense something positive. It's tough to play defense if you
don't think your offense can score any points.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami also believed it couldn't win if it turned the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Bledsoe was the focal point of their plan. They
wanted to knock him down as often as possible and make him move,
believing he doesn't throw as well when he's on the run. They also
wanted to be careful not to let Bledsoe step up in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the Patriots' offense had a couple of new
wrinkles designed to shake the Dolphins' confidence on defense.
Early on they came out in a no-back backfield on first down, but
the Dolphins sacked Bledsoe before he got the ball away. A couple
of plays later, they tried to throw a halfback option pass from
Lamont Warren back to Bledsoe. But Warren got hit and couldn't get
the ball away cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Patriots did well in the early going was run to
the right more than they usually have this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have tended to run to the left. Against the Jets,
on a key fourth and 1 in the first quarter, New York guessed left,
shot two linebackers into the hole, and stopped Terry Allen short
of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after recovering a fumble at the Miami 7 in the first
period, the Patriots used this tendency to score their first
touchdown. Fullback Tony Carter ran at the left guard, then Allen,
after a fake jab step left, got the ball and slashed over right
guard for 6 yards and the score. Inside linebacker Zach Thomas had
vacated the area after going for the fake.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the first quarter, Faulk used the same kind of
move on his 43-yard run. He started left, then darted over right
tackle. Again Thomas took the fake and was out of position. He
lunged and missed the tackle, and Faulk ran over safety Brock
Marion before being taken down deep in Miami territory, setting up
a 27-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Bledsoe didn't have much time to set his feet
and throw because of the Dolphins' excellent pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Huard was shaky starting out. He completed just two of his first
six passes for 7 yards. But in the second quarter, he started to
gain confidence, and finished the half 13 of 22, twice running for
first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots have to go to Buffalo, where the Bills play
some of the toughest defense in the league. There is no tougher
place to play than Buffalo if you are a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jets and Dolphins blitzed linebackers and defensive
backs to get after Bledsoe, the Bills can do it with just down
linemen. It's not going to get any easier.

VILLAGE SHELTERS FAMILIES EVADING THE REACH OF GOVERNMENT

   JINBIAN, China _ This tiny cluster of caves perched on a
hillside in northern Shaanxi province can barely be called a
village. But in its own way, it is a community for those who have
no other home.
</P>
<P>
   Jinbian has become something of a revolving-door refuge for
families who have violated China's one-child policy and are on the
run from government fines or sterilization; for societal misfits;
and for families whose disabled members were ostracized elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kong Baoqing, 27, came to Jinbian partly because her elderly
parents wanted to return home from the bitter cold of northern
Heilongjiang province and to escape the discrimination against her
mother, who is a dwarf. But Kong also wanted to have a second child
out of sight of local authorities there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are transients, so the government can't control us,'' she
had thought. But local authorities soon got wind of it and slapped
her with a $300 fine _ nearly half the average annual salary in
China _ and forced her to undergo sterilization surgery. Like other
flouters of the one-child policy instituted in 1979, she learned
that because of routine police checks, ``if you move here to an
abandoned cave, the government finds out within a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Kong's mother also violated family-planning rules by having four
children. But Kong says officials tacitly allow disabled people to
break the one-child rule _ partly out of compassion, and partly
because they believe disabled people need more help in old age.
</P>
<P>
   Kong has been allowed to stay in the village since her parents
originate from the region. But authorities refuse to give a
residency permit to Kong's husband and two children. It costs $25 a
term to send each child to school _ almost three times higher than
if they were legal local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought of building a real house last year but decided not
to, because then we'd be committed to stay,'' she said. ``If we
find a place to make more money, we will move on.''

<P>
   YAN'AN, China _ But for some smoky coal mines and petroleum
refineries, the dry, barren landscape that stretches for hundreds
of miles through north-central China looks much as it has for
centuries: rolling hills bereft of trees, rocky outcroppings from
yellow earth, and a mysterious motif _ thousands upon thousands of
arches carved into hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the curious pattern resembles a giant beehive.
But then the rustic wooden doors and colored quilts covering the
arches come into focus, and it becomes clear that peasants are
surviving in this harsh terrain just as their ancestors have since
prehistoric times: by digging a cave and calling it home.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five decades, China has hurtled from a feudal,
agrarian society to a communist, industrial model, and finally to
an increasingly market-oriented economy. Last week, China and the
United States signed a historic deal paving the way for Beijing to
enter the World Trade Organization, which in turn is expected to
further integrate China into the global economy. But a sizable
percentage of China's 1.3 billion people live in such isolated and
backward conditions that they are unlikely ever to benefit from the
fruits of freer trade and the boom along China's commercial
seaboard. There are no official figures, but some estimate that 40
million to 70 million Chinese peasants still live in earthen or
stone-front caves, mostly in the three neighboring provinces of
Shaanxi, Henan, and Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
   As China's economy marches forward, these present-day cave
dwellers don't even realize they have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Huo Laiyin, a 70-year-old peasant who lives in a cave in
Fanzhang village in northern Shaanxi, has heard of former leader
Deng Xiaoping, but never of his Open Door policy that began
expanding economic markets 20 years ago, fueling spectacular
growth. The prosperity that blessed China's cities in the past two
decades hasn't affected Huo; in fact, bad weather and soil erosion
mean her life has gotten worse. Her dry land became infertile and
her old cave started to crumble. She had to sell her only donkey
for money to buy food, and last year she moved into her brother's
cave.
</P>
<P>
   She gave up farming rather than pay taxes on land that yields no
crops. Her son cannot work because of a mysterious illness, and the
family cannot afford the $25 per term to send her 7-year-old
grandson to school.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest distance Huo has ever traveled is less than 20
miles to Yan'an, a city of fewer than 50,000 people. Unlike the
striving masses who fill China's major cities, she can't even dream
of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I even think of moving to Yan'an or living in an
apartment? I have no money, and I never will,'' she said, without a
hint of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Yan'an has a proud history as the mountainous redoubt of China's
communist revolutionaries while they were fighting the nationalist
rulers from 1936 to 1947. Mao Zedong slept in the hills in a cave
dug out of the clay-like loess, and his onetime base camp is now a
neatly swept tourist pilgrimage site. But while revolutionaries
lived in caves as a hideaway, families like Huo's have been living
here since Neolithic times _ out of topographical and economic
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   With few trees and not much building stone available, caves dug
out of the soil are the cheapest and most practical form of housing
here, costing $125 for skilled laborers to make the door and shape
the arch, and about $12.50 in taxes for the use of the land.
Sometimes a family will sell its cave before moving; but more
often, families abandon it when it is collapsing and dig a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Caves are also good for the changeable climate; the insulation
of the earth keeps dwellers cool in summer and warm in winter. They
are dark and poorly ventilated, but that doesn't seem to bother the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   So natural is a cave home to local people that even those who
build a freestanding dwelling have echoed the architecture of
caves, yielding the striking sight of arched, single-room,
earth-and-stone rowhouses that look like stables.
</P>
<P>
   The average earth cave is home to a multigenerational family and
consists of a single room about 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep into
the hillside. A ``kang'' _ a hard earthen platform carved out of
the back wall of a cave _ serves as bed, sofa, and dining area, and
is warmed by heat from an attached mud stove. Tureens balance over
the open fire, scenting the air with the smell of porridge. The
cooking utensils resemble ancient bowls and ladles. The massive,
circular grain-grinding stones outside each cave appear unchanged
since prehistoric times.
</P>
<P>
   The caves have no running water or bathrooms, and the brown mud
walls are decorated with newspaper or colored posters. Many caves
are electrified, with a single naked bulb hanging from a wire and a
cheap television set _ creating a bizarre juxtaposition of cave
dwellers watching historical costume dramas and soap operas
broadcast from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the government in Ningxia province launched a
five-year, $365 million program to voluntarily relocate one million
cave dwellers to new irrigated villages in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   But many cave people who had moved during an earlier pilot
project found the pioneer life too hard and moved back to their old
caves. The government says the new villages eventually prospered,
and there is a waiting list for people wanting to move.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Shaanxi cave villages, where the only sounds are of
roosters crowing, pigs squealing, and people chopping wood, no one
knows of any plans to move them. But they are counting on a
government vow to plant fruit trees to reforest the windswept soil
and yield a new harvest. Premier Zhu Rongji visited recently and
was struck by the barrenness of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Many older people here seem to have no sense of how hard their
living conditions are and have no particular interest in moving to
city dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In wintertime, a regular house is colder than this, and in
summer, our caves are cooler,'' said Yan Zhifa, 63, who has lived
in caves all his life. ``If you build a good, strong cave, you can
have several generations living there, maybe for 200 years. A
regular house needs repairs after five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who wears the blue Mao cap and plain navy buttoned shirt
still favored by older peasants, cannot grow crops on his eroded
parcel. He has to give the government $8 a year in cash for the use
of the land since he can't pay the tax in grain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because he has never seen anyone living any other way,
he has never thought to take advantage of the boom in China's
cities. ``We'd never dare to think like that,'' he said solemnly.
Nor does he blame the government for his condition; he just figures
this is the hand that life has dealt him.
</P>
<P>
   Yan says his life is unhappy not for a lack of material comforts
but because of loneliness. One of the downsides of modernization,
he said, is the desire among some young people, including his sons,
to live in their own caves, leaving widowers like Yan sleeping and
eating alone. And perhaps because of the influence of television,
the younger generation may be the first in centuries to try moving
out of caves entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city represents modernization, and of course we want to
develop,'' said Li Gaiqing, 36, cooking under a poster of Deng, the
leader whose modernization drive not only opened trade, but also
put a television in nearly every cave. ``It's just like food; once
you have enough to eat, you can think about eating good food. Once
you can live comfortably, you can think about a beautiful house.''

SUHA ARAFAT'S REAL MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was really newsworthy about Suha Arafat's anti-Semitic
blood libel wasn't that Hillary Clinton didn't condemn it. It was
that the Israeli government did.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady caught a lot of flak for not objecting when
Yasser Arafat's wife, during a ceremony in the Palestinian town of
Ramallah, blasted Israel for the ``daily and intensive use of
poison gas'' against Arab women and children. For good measure, she
also accused Israel _ in rhetoric straight out of the Dark Ages _
of having ``contaminated about 80 percent of water sources used by
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise that a woman who married the most
notorious killer of Jews in our time would spew such obscenities.
Nor should anyone have been astonished that Hillary failed to
pounce on Mrs. Arafat's words the way a savvy New York politician
would. After all, she's not a savvy New York politician.
</P>
<P>
   Only one detail made l'affaire Suha notable: The Israeli
government spoke up in protest. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office
issued a statement ``strongly condemning the unworthy statements
made by Suha Arafat. . . . Poisoning the public atmosphere does not
help the success of the negotiations.'' A stiff letter was
delivered to the Palestinian Authority. Israeli diplomats spread
the word that Jerusalem was angry.
</P>
<P>
   Par for the course, you might think. But it isn't. From Arafat
on down, leading Palestinians routinely traffic in disgusting
libels, anti-Semitic canards, and naked incitements to violence _
all of which have been strictly forbidden by the numerous peace
accords signed by Israel and the Palestinians. Yet rarely if ever
do Israeli leaders complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel carries out a clear policy of annihilating our people
and destroying our national economy by smuggling spoiled foodstuffs
. . . into PA (Palestinian Authority) territory,'' Abd al-Hamid
al-Qudsi, a deputy minister in Arafat's regime, said last year.
``Israel . . . aims to kill and destroy our people.'' Reaction from
the Israeli government? None that was detectable.
</P>
<P>
   A program on the PA-controlled television station instructs
viewers that ``the Jews are the seed of Satan and the devils.'' On
another broadcast, children sing at one of the Palestinians'
martial summer camps:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I came to you with my sword in hand.
</P>
<P>
   We will drive them (the Jews) out to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Your day is coming, conqueror, then we will settle accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Our accounts are unending in stones and bullets!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the constitution of Fatah, Arafat's wing of the
PLO, calls for the ``complete liberation of Palestine and
eradication of Zionist economic, political, military, and cultural
existence.'' In December, Al-Hayat Al-Jadeeda, the official PA
newspaper, published a Fatah communique: ``It is impossible to
struggle against (Israel) via negotiations. There is no alternative
but a struggle that will smash the Israeli aggression and emphasize
the readiness of our people to explode with force. . .''
</P>
<P>
   None of this drew a hot rebuke from the Israeli prime minister.
No Israeli diplomats protested the calls to violence by walking out
of negotiations with the Palestinians _ or by doing anything else.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Arafat bestowed the PLO's highest award on Khalil
al-Ra'i, a terrorist convicted of murdering an Israeli policeman.
The only word from Prime Minister Barak's office was that Israel,
as a sign of goodwill would soon release even more Palestinian
prisoners. A few weeks later, 199 Palestinian terrorists _ most of
them convicted killers _ were freed and sent by bus into
Palestinian territory. As they disembarked, they were handed guns
and welcomed into Arafat's militia.
</P>
<P>
   What are the Palestinians to think when so many openly
demonstrate their hatred of Israel, nurture in their children the
dream of killing Jews, and flout the treaties to which they have
pledged themselves, yet continue to be embraced by Israel as
``peace partners?'' The logical conclusion is that rejectionism
pays and that the ``peace process'' is a sham _ a fig leaf for slow
Israeli capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   So on and on it goes.
</P>
<P>
   September: An Arabic translation of ``Mein Kampf,'' complete
with a glowing introduction, climbs to No. 6 on the Palestinian
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   October: Farouk Kaddoumi, the head of Arafat's Political Bureau,
tells an interviewer: `Don't think the PLO has given up its rifle,
even though it currently proceeds with the (peace) process. We will
fight as long as our lands are occupied and we will use the
rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   November: The Palestinian education ministry issues a textbook
that teaches ``the basic similarity between Nazism, Fascism, and
Zionism.'' It fits nicely with earlier textbooks, such as the
language primer that tells fifth-graders, ``Remember, the final and
inevitable result will be the victory of the Muslims over the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of Palestinian _ indeed, Arab _ opinion confirm that
there is little desire for peace with the Jewish state. Much of the
Arab world still dreams of Israel's elimination. The hate-filled
rhetoric is not an act. But the Israeli government ignores it.
``These are only words,'' Shimon Peres says. ``Let them talk.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Suha Arafat's vile slander that so upset Israeli
officials. It was that she embarrassed Hillary Clinton in the
process. The next time Mrs. Arafat accuses Jews of gassing Arab
babies, she will make sure there is no American dignitary in
attendance. That, really, is all the Israelis ask.

A VOICE OF FAIRNESS AMID THE DECATUR DIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has been accused of meddling in a community's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He has been criticized as a publicity-seeker searching for an
issue to enhance his national image.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment he arrived in the central Illinois farming
town of Decatur, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was in the right place
for the right reason. He was there to expose an injustice delivered
to seven students who were initially expelled from school for two
years for brawling during a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Only after pressure from Jackson and Governor George Ryan did
the School Board agree to cut the expulsion from two years to one,
and allow the students to immediately enroll in an alternative
school. Yet Jackson knew that even a one-year expulsion is still
too severe a punishment for the brawl. There were no guns, no
knives, no drugs, and no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-second videotape of the fight, captured by a nearby
spectator, has been on virtually every newscast in the country. The
videotape, however, did not expose the true wrong: the School
Board's ``zero tolerance'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the expelled students were wrong to fight at the game,
and deserved a fitting punishment after due process. But there was
no fitting punishment, and no due process. The board's action
precluded both.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson said, rather than expell them and enhance their
chances of being dropouts or worse, a smarter punishment would be
to force them to stay in school under stricter conditions. ``If
there's hell in them,'' Jackson said, ``let's educate the hell out
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's arrival in Decatur did as much to bring a local
injustice to the nation's attention as did public airing of the
videotape of Los Angeles police beating Rodney King. In both cases,
those in power were caught delivering an injustice upon those
without power.
</P>
<P>
   Although the expelled students in Decatur were African-American,
Jackson was pragmatic and wise in stressing that the issue was
about fairness, not race. He reminded the School Board, and the
media, that in other, more serious incidents, the students involved
had received less harsh discipline.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he noted that a Decatur student, who is white, made
a bomb threat to the school, which is far more serious than the
highly publicized brawl. That student was expelled for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, knows that if he labeled this as strictly a
racial issue, he would set himself against conservatives who might
suggest that he is trying to use the ``race card'' to get the
students a lesser punishment. He could also lose credibility with
many African-Americans, who might accuse him of using racial
demagoguery to protect students who are guilty of starting a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Jackson is stressing the unfairness of the discipline
given the brawlers compared with punishments given other students.
He is letting the news media and television watchers see the
obvious: that it is about unfair treatment of individuals who
happen to be black. As Jackson puts it, ``This isn't about black or
white, it's about wrong or right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ongoing presence in Decatur _ a town in which blacks
make up 17 percent of the population, and 40 percent of public
school enrollment _ also has helped reveal other injustices against
the expelled students. None was given a chance to present his side
of the story. And the school reportedly released the offending
students' attendance and grades, in an apparent effort to show that
they were bad students as well as troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's filing of a lawsuit against the school administrators,
which seeks $5 million in damages for each of the six involved
students (one of the brawlers dropped out), will help assure that
the board's wrongful action will ultimately be more embarassing to
it than the release of their private records was to the students.
And attempts to justify the School Board's action by seeing four of
the students charged with felony counts of ``mob action'' will
prove futile.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson accompanied the students to alternative schools
last week, he is not giving up his fight to get them back into
regular classes in the Decatur school system. He wants them to be
eligible for reinstatement as early as January if they do well in
the alternative schools _ a compromise from his earlier position of
immediated reenrollment.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackie Goetter, president of the School Board, insists there
is no possibility of reinstatement before next spring. She said,
``There is nothing that the Rev. Jackson can say or do during his
visit to Decatur that would make me change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the School Board continues to dig in its heels,
Decatur, Ill., in 1999 may become what Selma, Ala., was in the
1960s. Because while much progress against racial injustice has
been made since Selma, the events in Decatur suggest we still have
a way to go.

   BOSTON _ Charles Ponzi did something few other criminals _ not
Al Capone or Jesse James _ could manage: He got his name attached
to his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi, who fleeced Bostonians out of millions in 1920, did not
invent what has come to be known as a Ponzi scheme, a scam in which
early investors are paid with money from new investors. The con had
been around for years, maybe centuries. But Ponzi did it on such a
grand scale, with such flair and in such full view of the world and
the media, that he earned his place in criminal history. ``He was a
celebrity and that only enticed more people into his scheme,'' says
William Galvin, Massachusetts secretary of state, who spends part
of his time trying to protect investors from modern-day Ponzi
imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi may have already been a crook when he left Italy in 1903
at age 20 for America. He participated in scams everywhere from
Providence to Montreal, where he wound up in prison for his
efforts. But Ponzi's ambition was as big as his adopted country. He
knew he was destined to be rich. He just needed the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   For Ponzi, the right idea turned out to be stamps, actually a
type of foreign stamps called International Reply Coupons. Through
some quirk in the laws, the coupons could be purchased overseas for
a penny or two and redeemed in the United States for 6 cents. In
theory, you could buy enough of the stamps to make huge profits. In
practice, Ponzi only needed the stamps for a cover story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was enough truth in the story to bring in the
gullible,'' says Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi set up an office at 27 School St. and created a firm
called the Securities and Exchange Company, a name meant to instill
confidence in potential investors. Then he made his offer:
Investors who bought into the company would get a 50 percent return
on their money in 45 days; a 100 percent return in 90 days. Banks
at the time paid 5 percent interest annually.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were slow at first, but Ponzi had the gift of gab and the
ability to tell people what they wanted to hear. If they were
skeptical, and some were, he could recount in great detail the
story of the stamps and assuage their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As time went on, Ponzi didn't need to do much selling: his
investors became his best sellers. They told friends, relatives,
and co-workers about the investment. If people actually wanted to
get their money back after 45 days, Ponzi was happy to oblige. He
had plenty on hand. In fact, most people chose to reinvest for
another 45 days, hoping for an even bigger score.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi started selling in December of 1919. By the spring he was
rich. He bought fancy suits and took to carrying a cane and a
gold-tipped cigarette holder. He bought an expensive car and hired
a chauffeur. He brought his mother over from Italy and purchased a
huge house in suburban Lexington for his wife, Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there was more money than he could spend. In May 1920,
he took in $442,000, according to biographer Donald Dunn, author of
``Ponzi: The Boston Swindler.'' By the summer he was taking in
$250,000 a day. He stuffed the money into closets and desk drawers.
Who said the streets of America weren't paved with gold? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity was a mixed blessing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi's wealth brought fame and attention from the newspapers,
which wanted to know more about the man with the Midas touch. The
celebrity was a mixed blessing: It attracted new investors but it
also brought scrutiny from law enforcement and hard-nosed
reporters. The Boston Post, smelling a rat, began publishing
skeptical stories about Ponzi, questioning how he could afford to
pay out such outlandish sums.
</P>
<P>
   A Post reporter interviewed Clarence Barron, the founder of the
financial publication, Barron's, who all but declared the Ponzi
plan a fraud. Barron checked with the Boston post office and found
out that hardly any of the International Reply Coupons were
actually being redeemed. ``Why don't the postal operations reflect
Ponzi's, if he truly is dealing in millions of coupons?'' Barron
asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the press wasn't Ponzi's only problem. As he knew better
than anyone, Ponzi schemes start well but end badly. You can rob
Peter to pay Paul, but eventually you run out of Pauls and the
whole thing collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi needed an exit strategy. At one point, in a very 1990s bit
of thinking, he considered taking his company public and using the
proceeds from the stock sale to pay off his debts. He also
contemplated taking over some local banks and using their money to
pay his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance. The Post, which won a Pulitzer Prize
for its Ponzi coverage, kept after him. Eventually the paper dug up
a prison photograph of Ponzi from Montreal. To add insult to
injury, Ponzi's public relations man deserted him and wrote an
article for the Post that said Ponzi was broke.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal with the state, Ponzi began giving back money to
investors. He gave back more than $3 million. Naturally there
wasn't enough to meet his obligations. When an auditor for the
state tallied up the figures he found that Ponzi had $3 million in
assets and $7 million in liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you are $4 million short,'' the auditor told Ponzi,
who reportedly replied, ``Gee. Then I guess I am not solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview just before he surrendered to police, Ponzi was
asked if he wanted to make a statement. The public deserves it,
don't you think? the reporter said. ``The public deserves exactly
what it gets, no more, no less,'' said Ponzi. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Suckers in all shapes and sizes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Spooner agrees. The well-known Boston stockbroker and
author says as long as there are people looking to get rich quick,
Ponzi schemes will thrive. ``P. T. Barnum was right,'' says
Spooner. ``There is a sucker born every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The suckers come in all shapes and sizes and from every social
class. In the 1970s a group of famous entertainers including Liza
Minelli, Andy Williams and Jack Benny lost millions when they
invested in a tax shelter plan that purported to invest in oil. It
turned out there were no oil wells.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy got a
number of financial heavyweights, including John Whitehead, the
chairman of Goldman Sachs and former US Treasury Secretary William
Simon, to contribute $100 million to a charity that promised it
would double donors' donations in six months. The money wound up in
the pocket of the foundation's creator, John Bennett Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Gullibility isn't strictly an American vice. In the mid-1990s
practically everyone in Albania poured money into a series of
Ponzi-style investment plans. By one estimate, $1 billion or 25
percent of the poor nation's gross national product was funneled
into the plans that promised high rates of interest and used new
money to pay off early investors. When angry Albanians found out
they had been duped, they rioted in the streets and threatened to
bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Nestor, one of Galvin's deputies, says there are some
common themes to all Ponzi schemes. They all sound too good to be
true, and they all guarantee high rates of return. In the real
world, says Nestor, there are no guarantees and high rewards only
come with high risk. ``We can regulate until we are blue in the
face,'' says Nestor, ``but if people are not careful they can be
ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi schemes have precious few winners. The list of losers
often includes the creator. ``Unless you have Whitey Bulger's
travel agent there is no way to get away with one,'' Galvin says.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ponzi didn't get away. He spent more than a decade in
jail. While he was in prison his mother died. When he got out his
wife divorced him and the government deported him to Italy. He died
in the charity ward of a Brazilian hospital in 1949. The last
picture of Ponzi, taken in the hospital, showed him with a big
smile on his face.

BRADLEY, GORE WIVES PLAYING KEY ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOISE, Idaho _ Politicians out here joke that you could put
every Idaho Democrat in a phone booth, with room to spare. This
state is so Republican that Democrats on the national ticket don't
bother to campaign here, and efforts to lure party bigwigs to Boise
almost always come up short.
</P>
<P>
   So snagging Ernestine Schlant Bradley, wife of the presidential
candidate Bill Bradley, to speak at the Ada County Democrats'
biennial dinner Thursday, was a huge coup. Then, suddenly, Tipper
Gore, wife of Al Gore, caught wind of the invitation and offered to
show up, too, hoping to deny Bradley any edge in the state's March
7 caucus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first face-to-face duel of the Democratic spouses,
and although both were too charming and cautious to draw blood, the
competition and chill between them, as each touted her husband's
superior vision, character, and record, was hard to miss for the
700 people who had packed the Boise State University ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing other than a friendly rivalry,'' Mrs. Gore said
coolly, as she kept a safe distance from Mrs. Bradley all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call it a friendly encounter,'' Mrs. Bradley crisply
corrected, adding that she had greeted Mrs. Gore with a little air
kiss, ``as is customary.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplished and telegenic, articulate and energetic, the wives
are proving to be the real ``alphas'' in the unexpectedly lively
contest for the Democratic nomination. It's only November, yet Mrs.
Gore and Mrs. Bradley are campaigning almost nonstop, traveling
solo to Democratic strongholds and to out-of-the-way places, and
serving as the most prized of surrogate speakers to groups of
political independents, party activists, and women. Each is on a
mission to humanize her husband, convey marital harmony, and build
personal connections, particularly with female voters, by sharing
their personal traumas (clinical depression for Mrs. Gore; breast
cancer and a mastectomy for Mrs. Bradley) and glimpses of their
private lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are at opposite ends of the playing field, so to
speak, but I really think Tipper and I are united in that we are
campaigning for our husbands, who are dearest to us,'' Mrs. Bradley
said in Boise, adding that she doubted the wives would ``put
ourselves through this'' for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster John Zogby says love and devotion may not be the
only motivators. ``Baby-boomer voters need to bond with the
candidates, so here we have their wives, merging the personal and
the political and being the ones to say, `We all have our problems,
we aren't running as Ken and Barbie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, Mrs. Gore and Mrs. Bradley emphasized that
they are not reluctant participants in the 2000 campaign, or
silently suffering spouses pulled into the political maelstrom by
their husbands' egos or ambitions. Unlike their Republican
counterparts, who say they'd be just as happy to return to
homemaking after the 2000 campaign, Tipper Gore and Ernestine
Bradley are in this race completely, aggressively, to win the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home this morning I said something to Al about the campaign
_ I wasn't criticizing him _ and he said, `Gosh, well, I'll try not
to blow the election for you,' '' Mrs. Gore said as she sipped Diet
Coke in her spacious, photograph-filled suite in the Old Executive
Office Building in Washington. ``It was very funny and kind of
cute. But it was also like he just realized how much this meant to
me, how passionately I am campaigning for a lot of issues I care
deeply about, and he appreciated my working so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   After being part of two national campaigns, and spending seven
years as vice presidential spouse, Tipper Gore, 51, was ready for
her husband's biggest race: She was primed on the issues and
prepared for the separations and strains that a campaign puts on a
marriage and family. Last spring, she revealed that she had been
treated for depression and taken medications after a 1989 car
accident that nearly killed her young son.
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Gore did not expect, however, was to have her husband
in the kind of fight that has sent her canvassing for votes in New
Hampshire, and dashing through five Iowa towns a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more like his first race for Congress,'' Mrs. Gore
said, recalling how she went door-to-door in her husband's
Tennessee district in 1976, jotting down names of potential
supporters and typing thank-you letters after the couple got home
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Bradley, 64, a professor of German and comparative
literature at Montclair State University in New Jersey, was
involved in her husband's three Senate campaigns. But it was never
like this, never a year's leave of absence from a 35-year academic
career, to sleep in a strange bed in a different city nearly every
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give up my job, to be on leave, is something very different
for me,'' Mrs. Bradley said as she rested in a Pittsburgh hotel
room between four public appearances that day. ``I don't think that
some of the other wives are working this hard. It's personal _ it's
about the way they see their husbands, their relationship, the
need. Every wife can sort of call her own shots, and I think that
is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bradley, a German-American who speaks with a slight accent,
said she ``could not conceive of not wanting to be totally there''
for her husband when he decided to run for president. After all,
she said, he had stood by her ``any day, any hour of the day,''
when she had cancer, and there had been ``no question'' about
Professor Schlant remaining in New Jersey to teach when Senator
Bradley moved to Washington in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to say he has been there for me, therefore I am
there for him. But we have the kind of relationship that if you can
help the other person, that's what you do,'' Mrs. Bradley said.
``If Bill, who is the soul-searching type, said he was ready to
offer his services to the country, I just do not feel that I could
now say, `Yeah, but I'm not ready.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spouses in the spotlight
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the public has come to expect a prospective
president's wife to behave more like a political surrogate and
policy advocate than a smiling, seen-but-not-heard spouse. Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Elizabeth Hanford Dole showed that candidate
wives can be savvy and have opinions, and a relentlessly probing
press has put spouses in the spotlight for details of their private
family lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has definitely been an evolution in the wives' roles,''
said Dianne Bystrom, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for
Women and Politics at Iowa State University. ``What makes Mrs. Gore
and Mrs. Bradley unique is that while they come from quite
different backgrounds, both are very comfortable communicating with
the public, and both are very bright and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Boise dinner, Mrs. Gore, who was greeted by dozens of
blue-and-white ``Tipper!'' signs provided by the Gore campaign,
impressed the audience with polish, poise, and professionalism.
Mrs. Bradley, who seems to flaunt a certain political naivete,
spoke with such passion and animation that some listeners said they
would consider supporting her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bradley is a scholar who spent 10 years writing ``The
Language of Silence,'' a book about the near-absence of images of
the Holocaust in West German literature. Mrs. Gore is an advocate
for the homeless and the mentally ill who a decade ago drew barbs
as she led a fight to clean up record lyrics. Both women are
grandmothers, yet both giggle when asked how they spend private
moments with their husbands.

FILMS RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
!! ``Felicia's Journey'' Bob Hoskins is creepily compelling as a
bachelor chef in grimy Birmingham who offers refuge to Elaine
Cassidy's pregnant Irish girl looking for her boyfriend. But the
pieces never come together satisfyingly, making Atom Egoyan's film
of William Trevor's novel seem over-stylized and too detached.
(PG-13) 
 
!!! ``Joe the King'' Less is more in Frank Whaley's
autobiographical coming-of-age film. The title character is a child
of the underclass who is anything but a king and can't even escape
into anonymity in his small upstate New York town. Noah Fleiss is
appealingly gallant as young Joe, and Val Kilmer delivers a bravely
self-abnegating performance as his alcoholic father. (R) 
 
!!! ``Last Night'' Don McKellar proves a simpatico director in this
film that drolly _ and then movingly _ goofs on Canadian politeness
and reasonableness, even when the characters are faced with the
knowledge that the world will end in six hours. McKellar, as a man
who just wants to end it all quietly and alone, projects disarming
modesty. Sandra Oh, as a woman stranded in the wrong part of
Toronto, unable to get home for a final dinner with her husband, is
affecting, too. (R) 
 
(FR) !! 1/2 ``The Legend of 1900'' Giuseppe Tornatore's gorgeous
fable about a foundling boy discovered on an ocean liner at the
turn of the century. As played by Tim Roth, he becomes a legendary
pianist who never leaves the ship, sailing through the ragtime and
jazz eras. There's a terrific keyboard duel with Jelly Roll Morton,
but the film is too long and too slack not to go adrift. (R) 
 
!! ``Sleepy Hollow'' Tim Burton's take on Washington Irving country
and the Headless Horseman legend is visually stunning, even if he
rips off his own ``Nightmare Before Christmas'' blatantly. Johnny
Depp and Christina Ricci are good-looking romantic leads, but the
motive behind a series of seemingly ghostly decapitations in 1799
is transparent, and the film seems pretty empty, despite the juicy
atmosphere. (R) 
 
!!! ``West Beirut'' Ziad Doueiri's engaging autobiographical film
about growing up during the chaos of the Lebanese civil war of the
1970s. With school shut down, he and his pals turned filmmakers get
into sweet trouble in this lovingly detailed chronicle. The movie
faces up to the danger that never lets them forget that their
neighborhood is not the playground it sometimes appears to be.
(Unrated) 
 
!! 1/2 ``The World Is Not Enough'' This 19th James Bond caper looks
snazzy, but barely gets by on the strength of its stylistic
flourishes, including a pileup of over-the-top wordplay. Pierce
Brosnan musters the necessary deadpan aplomb, but the plot,
involving Robert Carlyle's Russian terrorist trying to nuke Sophie
Marceau's oil pipeline, has a been-there, done-that quality. The
script is not enough. (PG-13)

   NEW RELEASES: ``Chinatown'' (25th Anniversary Edition, DVD) _
One of the best films ever made stars Jack Nicholson who is both a
private eye confused about reality and, despite a veneer of
cynicism, a rather innocent fellow. Director Roman Polanski,
screenwriter Robert Towne, Nicholson, producer Robert Evans,
production designer Richard Sylbert, and composer Jerry Goldsmith
collaborated on this seminal film. The new edition features
interviews with Evans, Polanski, and Towne on both the VHS and DVD
editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' _ Eric Rohmer continues to make anti-MTV movies
with confident aplomb. In an age of hyperspeed cinema, Rohmer
allows his characters and situations to take their time. This
romance is filled with the familiar Rohmer details, making it one
of the best films of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Zed and Two Noughts'' _ The first time I saw Peter
Greenaway's meditation I didn't have a clue as to what was going
on. Dead beasts, naked people, delectable food, and dozens of other
striking images make this an intriguing film that needs several
viewings to get part of the point.

   The demise of EgyptAir 990 is shaping up as one of the great
whodunits in the annals of aviation disasters. That is why
Americans have plunged into this terrifying tale, discussing it
last week as they gathered around fax machines and dinner tables at
a pitch not seen after the TWS and Swissair crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Why the intensity? Primarily because authorities have introduced
the possibility that a human _ not some mechanical failure _ caused
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the story also generates such heat because supporters and
opponents of this view offer equally compelling arguments defending
their respective cases.
</P>
<P>
   Tension forged from competing versions of events crackle through
the story. Either the National Transportation Safety Board or the
Egyptian government is utterly wrong about what happened in the
skies off of Nantucket early in the morning of October 31.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Egypt is America's best friend in the
Mideast. Its reputation is at stake. So is ours. As dramas go, you
can't do much better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the TWA nor Swissair crash carried this kind of torque,
notwithstanding the early charges of a missile attack on the TWA
plane that have been long since discredited. Here, in contrast, the
NTSB raises the specter of a villain lurking in the cockpit _
malignant flesh and blood prepared to commit suicide and kill 217
souls with malice aforethought.
</P>
<P>
   This macabre vision is further infused by the rampant fears in
the West of terrorists committing horrific acts in the name of
Islam. And terrorism is indeed another possible explanation for the
crash. There were over 30 Egyptian military officers on the flight,
including three brigadier generals.
</P>
<P>
   According to one NTRB source quoted early in the investigation,
the presence of this critical mass of military elite immediately
raised questions of foul play. Under that theoretical line of
reasoning, if co-pilot Gamil El Batouty really did cause the crash,
he could have done so for political rather than personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir 990 story is also personal in a way that TWA and
Swissair were not. We know the name of the man who may _ and it's
only ``may;'' we don't know anything for sure yet _ have
intentionally put the Boeing 767 into its fatal dive. There has
been massive media coverage of his family. We have learned that a
daughter has lupus and, according to a son, the father was bringing
automobile tires he purchased in the U.S back to Egypt with him. We
have even seen his Cairo apartment, and heard his wife describe
their close relationship. If he is the culprit, al-Batouti will be
an infamous one _ not another shadowy killer who goes down with the
plane or somehow slips into Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The ``criminal act'' scenario is the worst nightmare of every
flier who has ever harbored doubts about the guys in the cockpit,
any cockpit. How many of us will stare long and hard at our flight
crew the next time we board the New York shuttle? Is the pilot
having a bad day, we wonder? If nothing else, this plane crash has
buttressed the notion that just because you're paranoid doesn't
mean they're not out to get you.
</P>
<P>
   United States diplomats have been concerned about the speed with
which the NTSB has floated the idea that El Batouty or another
pilot may have sent the plane into a suicide plunge. So has Frank
Wisner, Jr., a former ambassador to Egypt and luminary of our
foreign policy establishment, who cautions against the suicide
theory. The NTSB is couching its statements with conditional verbs
as the case becomes increasingly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we don't know how to assess the significance of what
El-Batouty said _ or is believed to have said _ in Arabic before
the plane began its precipitous dive. Dueling experts fight over
meaning, and authorities dutifuly nod to ``cultural differences.''
Are our experts right or did they miss subleties that Egyptian
experts will detect?
</P>
<P>
   Americans who care about US relations with Egypt in particular,
and the Arab world in general, know that our government has to get
this right. The rest of us must probe the Egyptian charge that the
American media has rushed to judgment in condemning a senior pilot
of their national airline. Are the Cairenes right here, or are they
experiencing a national case of denial? Their cause was not helped
by an Eyptian government official who told CNN that there is a
``triangle of death'' over the Atlantic that swallowed TWA,
Swissair, JFK Jr. and now EgyptAir. Such fantasies rob this
investigation of the objectivity it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Americans lean toward the NTSB suicide theory because
we find the NTSB investigators credible. They are, after all, our
investigators. Besides, there appears to be no hint of mechanical
error.
</P>
<P>
   Given the stunning developments that have already appeared,
though, we are prepared for more precipitous plot changes in this
yarn. They could materialize in the findings of an exhaustive
US-Egyptian review of the voice recorder to be completed this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we remain glued to this story that gnaws at us.

PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN DID `FLAWLESS' RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You may not have noticed Philip Seymour Hoffman in
the roles that paid his rent for the last few years _ a boisterous
funnel-chaser in ``Twister,'' Robin Williams's stuffy classmate in
``Patch Adams.'' However, if you saw Hoffman's gofer with a crush
on Mark Wahlberg's porn star in ``Boogie Nights'' or his
sweaty-palmed obscene phone caller in ``Happiness,'' you probably
still remember them. When you can triangulate three standout
characterizations as an actor, you're on the map. As of now,
Hoffman is on the map. What will make it official is his drag queen
named Rusty, teaching Robert De Niro's stroke victim to sing as an
aid to the latter's recovery in ``Flawless,'' opening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Director and on this occasion writer Joel Schumacher says he
could have gone one of two ways with what became Hoffman's role _
find a drag queen who could act, or find an actor who could
research the drag and trans-gender aspects of the role. Most
important, after seeing dozens of transvestites, Schumacher quickly
decided to put on screen a Rusty who could, dramatically speaking,
go toe to toe with De Niro. That, Schumacher says, meant Hoffman, a
character actor who in his view will find work for the rest of his
life. Lest you think this mere directorial effusiveness, Schumacher
put his production schedule on the line. Rather than go with
someone else, he was willing to work around the shoot of ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley,'' in which Hoffman plays a playboy who makes
life difficult for Matt Damon's high-living schemer on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the scheduling worked out. Hoffman, stretched out
on a sofa in an East Side hotel, a few miles and a few worlds away
from his Greenwich Village flat, wearing a gray suit and white
shirt, straw-colored hair tousled, could pass for a bond salesman
after a long day on the job. It has been about a decade since
Hoffman left the suburb of Rochester, N.Y., where he grew up, but
the suburb hasn't entirely left him. He unself-consciously uses
expressions like, ``Alrighty,'' admits to being part of the
prevailing jock culture in high school, where he was too small for
football, did OK on the diamond at second and short, and went to
the mat for the wrestling team until a neck injury sidelined him.
Going where the girls were, he took up acting in search of social
success, decided after a production of ``The Crucible'' to keep
doing it, and did.
</P>
<P>
   He disarmingly admits to watching the recent World Series,
observing a few Chuck Knoblauch misplays, and fantasizing about
where he might have wound up if not for that neck injury. ``I grew
up in a big jock town, so it made a big impact on me,'' he says.
``I dreamed about what it would be like to be a professional
baseball player. That was the one sport I was truly good at. But I
didn't even finish playing high school ball, let alone college. If
I had kept it up, life might have been a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hoffman threw himself at acting, went wherever he could
find work, still considers himself less of a movie actor than a
stage actor. Part of the reason he stays in New York is to work
with an off-off-Broadway theater group, Labyrinth, where he made
his directing debut this year.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant at first
</P>
<P>
   He didn't exactly jump at the role of Rusty, he says. ``I read
the script and told Joel, `Well, that's something I can't do.' ''
Schumacher told Hoffman he was his only choice for the role.
``Well, he thinks I can do it, I said to myself. So why don't I
look at it more closely?'' With time, a lot of research in drag
clubs and copious backgrounding from trans-gender experts, Hoffman
agreed. While De Niro, whose extensive preparation and research for
his roles is legendary, studied the behavior of stroke victims and
their therapies, Hoffman watched documentaries and talked to a
variety of people from Rusty's world. ``I learned a lot about how
they think about themselves, behaviors, how they talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the externals. Then, underneath, I felt like I
could tap into certain aspects of Rusty's character by wanting to
please people that aren't going to be pleased by you, or trying to
be accepted by people who aren't going to be accepting of you. I
had never worn a dress before, and of course Rusty makes her living
in a gown at a club. I was nervous about being accepted by the real
drag queens in the film,'' Hoffman says. ``But they were
appreciative of what I was doing and I think we were pretty quickly
comfortable with one another. Rusty thinks he's a woman trapped in
a man's body. He's not altogether comfortable with the term drag
queen because he doesn't think it applies to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his heart, he wants to be Donna Reed, married to a straight
man, making dinner for their adopted kids. Bob's character comes to
me for voice lessons as part of his stroke therapy. He's this very
hetero guy, threatened by me, but he's forced to deal with who I
am. I enjoy playing people who are easy to dismiss as marginal.
They're struggling with their demons, too. I think that there are
universal themes that this movie talks about. I don't think it's
that much about masculinity issues, as more and more movies today
are. I think it's just about how two people can be very different,
but have to deal with one another, how they go about doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher got his idea for the film, he says, after a friend
suffered several strokes and was able to improve his speech
dramatically with singing lessons. The fact that De Niro signed on
first was initially inhibiting to Hoffman, Schumacher says. Hoffman
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little fear''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I would do myself that's anything like
Rusty,'' Hoffman said. ``The only thing I could connect with was
the emotional journey.'' He relied on an immersion in the character
to get him past his inhibitions. It worked, to the point where both
actors were able to improvise, in character, at the keyboard,
during the lesson scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little fear in the beginning,'' Hoffman says.
``Actually acting with De Niro was very nice. He's a great actor,
very respectful, very honorable, so it was kinda effortless. He
listens, he's open and game for anything. As a person, he's Robert
De Niro, though. So talking was weird. I was a little nervous. It
was always just a little bit there when I was talking to him,''
Hoffman recalls, believing yet not quite entirely believing that
one of the reasons Schumacher cast him was for his daring.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has much time to worry about it. He's too busy.
After ``Flawless'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' we'll see
Hoffman as a nurse in ``Magnolia,'' from his ``Boogie Nights''
director Paul Thomas Anderson. He just wrapped David Mamet's
``State and Main'' in Manchester-by-the-Sea. In it, he satisfies a
long-standing ambition _ playing a romantic role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me the other day about taking risks in my
choice of roles. I don't think of it as risk-taking,'' Hoffman
says. ``I just wanna make something creative and interesting and
new. I just take these parts I get and try to deal with them. If
that's risk-taking, then so be it. I just think it's the only way
to go about acting. Otherwise it's kinda boring. Unless you do
something special.''

A LEAP FOR AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been the century of American dominance in dance. From
Isadora Duncan to Mark Morris, jazz-tap to hip-hop, dance on film,
television, and computers and on the Broadway stage, America led
the way through most of the 1900s. No other country is even in
contention. Russian ballet may have ruled as the century opened,
but less than three decades into it, Russian ballet moved to
America, with George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest classical choreographer of the century, Balanchine
started his career in St. Petersburg and then brought his talents
to Paris. But he spent nearly 50 years, the bulk of his career,
making ballets in New York. His transplant was prompted not just by
a job offer from Filene's heir Lincoln Kirstein: He wanted, he
said, to come to a country where all the girls looked like Ginger
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   In 20th-century modern dance, Germany played a key role, through
such important choreographers as Mary Wigman and Kurt Jooss.
Jooss's 1932 ``The Green Table,'' produced between the two World
Wars, still stands as the greatest antiwar ballet of the century.
But the rise of the Nazis either stifled Germany's most creative
voices or sent them into exile. It was American modern dancers,
from Duncan to Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Merce Cunningham,
Trisha Brown, and the Judson Dance Theater, who wrote the script
for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Classical dance, like modern, has seen important choreographers
outside the United States in this century, starting with the
Russians. Mikhail Fokine, creator of ``Les Sylphides,''
``Petrouchka,'' and ``The Firebird,'' was even more significant as
a reformer: His ``Five Principles,'' published in a 1914 letter to
the London Times, argued passionately for a new movement vocabulary
for each new ballet, ``instead of merely giving combinations of
ready-made and established steps,'' he wrote. This was, in a way,
the antithesis of the Balanchinian delight in manipulating those
established steps. It was a modern dance credo. ``Modern'' also
describes the few works Vaslav Nijinsky made before insanity
silenced him, including the 1913 ``Rite of Spring,'' the century's
most scandalous ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and its outposts produced great storytellers in dance:
Frederick Ashton, John Cranko, Kenneth MacMillan, all masters of
the narrative in a century when abstraction came to the fore. Every
so often, a gifted ballet maker would pop up in some other country:
Birgit Cullberg in Sweden, say, or Jiri Kylian in the Netherlands.
Many would include French-born Maurice Bejart on that select list.
(I wouldn't.)
</P>
<P>
   But the action was, in the main, in the United States.
Balanchine dominated, his supremacy reinforced by the Ford
Foundation's unprecedented $7.75 million grant to American dance in
1963, which went mainly to Balanchine satellites, establishing his
style and repertory across the country. His fellow New York City
Ballet choreographer Jerome Robbins also ranks as one of the
century's greats. So does London-born Antony Tudor, who moved to
New York in 1939 and created a small body of brooding psychological
dramas for City Ballet's great rival, American Ballet Theatre. If I
had to pick a single performance from my decades of dance watching
to see again on my deathbed, it would be Gelsey Kirkland in Tudor's
heartbreaking 1975 ``The Leaves Are Fading,'' in which the
protagonist recalls the love of her youth. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Diaghilev's influence &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defining moment of 20th-century Western theatrical dance was
the May 19, 1909, Paris premiere of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets
Russes. In his 20 years of presenting performances in the West,
Diaghilev offered a world of spectacle, surprise, and virtuosity.
He, and his dancers, had a global influence. They toured
tirelessly: Anna Pavlova, after she left Diaghilev's troupe, became
the greatest ambassador ballet has ever seen. Ballets Russes
spinoffs survived through most of the century. In the 1950s and
'60s, when I was growing up in Worcester, a Ballets Russes
descendant still came to town every year. The troupe's annual
visits to small American cities sparked many future balletomanes'
interest, mine included.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballets Russes was an early case of dance going global, a
phenomenon furthered by film and television. Diaghilev also
championed collaboration. Choreographers, composers, and designers
had always worked together, of course, but Diaghilev pushed the
idea that they were equals. Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and Poulenc were
among the composers he commissioned; Picasso, Rouault, and Matisse
numbered among the designers. The notion of a team of titans
continued through the century, in, for instance, Martha Graham's
historic 1944 ``Appalachian Spring,'' with decor by the great
sculptor Isamu Noguchi and a score that would become one of Aaron
Copland's signatures. Later, there were Merce Cunningham's
collaborations with John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The modern dance that developed at the turn of the century
rebelled against the stale conventions of European ballet and the
even more pallid pre-Balanchine classicism that had survived the
trip across the Atlantic. But the battle between ballet and modern
dance is more in the minds of the media, and the public, than the
choreographers'. Fokine's reforms, for instance, were linked to
Duncan's ideas about unfettered expression. Balanchine collaborated
with Martha Graham in the 1950s. In 1973, Twyla Tharp created
``Deuce Coupe,'' which was performed by her own company and the
dancers of the Joffrey Ballet, together on the same stage. ``Deuce
Coupe'' was also notable for its score, by the Beach Boys, an
example of the 20th-century fondness for blending ``high'' and
``low'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decades of the century, few great choreographers of
strictly classical lineage emerged, and the ``crossover'' ballet
was born. Modern choreographers were tapped to create works for
ballet companies, and it turned out they weren't just filling gaps:
Tharp, Paul Taylor, Mark Morris, and other modern dancers have made
some of the best works that ballet companies now perform.
</P>
<P>
   Morris gets my vote as the preeminent choreographer at century's
end, either modern or classical. He can work in both idioms,
creating for his own troupe or for a top classical company. What
links him both to Duncan and to Balanchine, and distinguishes him
from his peers, is his intense musicality, whether he's
choreographing to trashy Thai pop songs or the baroque scores for
which he has a special affinity. In the late '80s, Morris and his
company were in residence at the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in
Brussels; they were, in effect, the national ballet company. In
Belgium, Morris made works including his magisterial 1988
``L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato.'' A European opera house
gave him the stability virtually all American choreographers lack.
We may boast the world's best dance makers, but there's no boasting
to be done about our shameful lack of official support for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's been the Russians who have occasionally come to
the rescue of American modern dance in this century. Rudolf Nureyev
and Mikhail Baryshnikov, the most celebrated of the
dancer-defectors and the men who revitalized male dancing in the
West, left Russia partly in search of the liberty to perform
something other than a Communist-dictated repertory. Their desire
to dance the works of Graham, Taylor, and Morris, and the
willingness of the public to pay almost anything to see the Russian
stars in their prime, at times helped keep American modern dance
companies financially afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Who can dance? Who can make dances? The 20th century has
broadened the answers to both questions. Early modern dance, for
instance, was a matriarchy. When European opera houses had a lock
on serious theatrical dance, women choreographers didn't stand a
chance. American women _ Duncan, Loie Fuller, Ruth St. Denis, and
others _ made their chance, along with a freer form of movement.
While men have caught up, modern dance has remained a field where
women have never occupied a secondary position.
</P>
<P>
   A secondary position was what black ballet dancers occupied
until New York City Ballet star Arthur Mitchell, the first
African-American to make it big in ballet, started the Dance
Theatre of Harlem in the wake of Martin Luther King's
assassination. Black dancers had been expected to dance black
material, as they did in the company of Alvin Ailey, whose 1960
``Revelations,'' set to spirituals, is a 20th-century touchstone.
Mitchell's point was that classical ballet was everyone's heritage,
that a black ballerina could dance ``Giselle.''

 UNDATED: ... dance ``Giselle.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His company helped unravel traditional hierarchies. Taylor had
done that, too, by choosing dancers for their differences rather
than their cookie-cutter uniformity. Choreographers including
Meredith Monk and Bill T. Jones began using heavy-set dancers. Liz
Lerman formed a company that included senior citizens. There are
now enough wheelchair dance troupes to stage wheelchair dance
festivals. These developments aren't merely PC: They go along with
a genuine interest in diversity because it's interesting, not just
good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Dance that was once ``ethnic'' is now ``art.'' African dance
turns up in mainstream theaters, on concert series with major
ballet and modern companies, and there's growing awareness that the
term ``African'' encompasses a great many styles of dance. It's a
big continent. There's also new awareness that traditional forms
aren't all that non-Western countries have to offer, that, say,
Japanese dance didn't stop with kabuki. Japan's haunting postwar
butoh dance won a wide public in the West _ and a loyal one. Butoh
has outlived fad status.
</P>
<P>
   American jazz-tap dance was revived in recent decades, as its
greatest practitioners were dying off _ but in time for young
dancers like Savion Glover to benefit from contact with the
legends. Native American dance was reformulated for the proscenium
stage, where it earned an enthusiastic audience. Vernacular modes
from other countries _ including Argentina's tango _ have earned
virtual cult status.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of dance in the 20th century grew to include
choreography on trapezes, underwater, and on ice. Ice dancing has
been around in one way or another since ice skates, but in the late
20th century it became a respected form rather than a novelty. I
treasure the memory, now more than a decade old, of John Curry
appearing between the parted curtains at the rear of the
Metropolitan Opera House and skating straight downstage in one
serene gesture, moving and still at the same time. Just as
Balanchine made ballet ever more athletic _ bigger, higher, faster
_ Curry and others made a form of athletics into art. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Furthering drama &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among Fokine's reforms was a call for dance to further drama
rather than interrupt it. In the 18th century, the
composer-choreographer Jean-Georges Noverre had fought for pretty
much the same thing. In the mid-20th century, so did Agnes De
Mille, in a string of Broadway hits that included ``Oklahoma!,''
``Carousel,'' and ``Brigadoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway musical became the forum for some of the great
dance of the century, starting with Balanchine's 1936 ``On Your
Toes,'' with its sizzling ``Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'' number.
Robbins's ``West Side Story'' is the zenith of dance as the very
heart of the musical, with choreographer doubling as director, a
practice continued in Michael Bennett's 1975 ``A Chorus Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The movies brought dance to audiences of unprecedented size, who
lined up to watch James Cagney, Gene Kelly, and other greats. Busby
Berkeley was the early master of the cinematic dance spectacle;
Fred Astaire, of dance intimacy on-screen. Astaire and Rogers rank
as one of the great 20th-century dance partnerships, right up there
with Nureyev and the incandescent Margot Fonteyn.
</P>
<P>
   The film with dance as its raison d'etre took root: The Gregory
Hines-Mikhail Baryshnikov ``White Nights'' is a good example of
recent vintage. Television, from Ed Sullivan to PBS's ``Great
Performances'' series, has brought serious dance into millions of
homes. But television has in general disappointed dance fans.
Rarely has it responded to excellence in choreography with
respectful camera work and full-length, not fractured,
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of film and video folk have experimented with dance,
sometimes with stellar results _ which tend to be shown in art
cinemas or university auditoriums rather than mass-market venues.
Film and video have also been invaluable in documenting dance,
which is rightly called the most ephemeral art. While there have
been efforts to notate and preserve it since the Renaissance, it's
only in the 20th century that effective systems like Labanotation,
a symbol-language arranged on a vertical staff, have been
developed.
</P>
<P>
   New technology can also prolong the life of a dance. Consider
something called ``motion capture,'' in which reflective markers
are attached to the dancer, their movements recorded by a dozen
cameras surrounding the stage, then channeled into a single file
that can drive a simulated 3-D figure on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Motion capture is used to preserve choreography, which became an
even more urgent matter in the age of AIDS, a plague that has
decimated the dance world. Motion capture is also used to create
work. A superb example is ``Ghostcatching,'' a recent collaboration
between choreographer-dancer Bill T. Jones and digital artists Paul
Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar. In this ``virtual dance installation''
you watch the lines of Jones's body and the path where he's been;
you watch him multiply and divide. You marvel at the poetry of the
piece, at how far beyond technical gimmickry it goes. You remember
that preservation is particularly pressing to Jones, who has been
HIV-positive for over a decade. You witness what may well be the
future of the art.

 BOISE, Idaho: ... their husbands.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We obviously do pleasurable things with each other _ you know
what I mean!'' Mrs. Gore said with a wide grin. Among those
pleasures was a rare day off recently when the Gores had lunch
together, played pool with their 17-year-old son, Albert, and just
talked. Mrs. Gore said she purposely took on extra campaign duties
this fall so her husband wouldn't miss any of Albert's high school
football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of trade-off that a lot of people don't believe
it is possible to make in a presidential campaign,'' said Mrs.
Gore, who also has three grown daughters, ``but we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year Bradley marriage, like Mrs. Bradley's campaign role,
by some measures has not been traditional. For Mrs. Bradley, it was
her second marriage; she was 39, he was 31. The couple lived apart
while each pursued careers, and their only child, Theresa Anne, 22,
lived with her father from the age of 10. At a luncheon in
Pittsburgh, women applauded Mrs. Bradley when she talked about her
commuter marriage and how she would ``cook all weekend'' in
Washington, filling the family freezer with food.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradleys may seem like a cerebral couple, but really, Mrs.
Bradley said, ``mundane'' things dominate their conversations.
``When we are together, we talk a lot about the issues _ so many
questions come up, and I don't always know the answer _ and we talk
about, uhm, personal matters,'' she said, playfully rolling her
eyes. ``And we ask each other questions, like `How do you feel, are
you OK, are you exhausted?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The character question
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Gore and Mrs. Bradley seem never to tire of vouching
for their husbands' character or sketching the human dimension of
two men who sometimes seem wooden and wonkish. Their other role is
to persuade women voters, who provided the margin of victory for
the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992 and 1996, to stick with a Democrat
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Both call their husbands ``authentic,'' one of the buzzwords of
the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is making a transition from being a sitting vice
president _ dutiful, steadfast, loyal, hard-working, been there on
policies that have benefited women _ and now he is leaving behind
being in the shadows, and he is emerging as his own person with his
own views, his own vision, his own record, his own life story,''
Mrs. Gore said, complaining that the press ``distorts'' Gore's
image and isn't giving him ``a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al is a great guy, compassionate, very smart,'' said Mrs.
Gore, who met Gore at a school dance and married him in 1970.
``Obviously character matters, but I think it does come through,
and I hope people get an authentic view of what kind of person he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bradley sums up her husband in three words: ``absence of
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking for some rah-rah-rousing kind of
personality, well, Bill is much more low key, more subtle,'' said
Mrs. Bradley, who speaks with some animation and looks listeners in
the eye. ``I say he is authentic because he is not posturing, he is
not trying to fulfill some kind of expectation that others have of
him. He is sincere and presents himself as who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Bradley, a former basketball star with the New
York Knicks, has a gender gap: He is much more popular with men
than women. While Mrs. Bradley denies she has been deputized to
close the gap, she often speaks to women's groups, and she
particularly likes talking about women's health issues and meeting
with breast-cancer survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill loves strong women. In fact, the stronger they are, the
better he likes them,'' Mrs. Bradley said. ``The reason he isn't
known that well to women is that women don't care about
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their husbands' maleness
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine Schlant was doing research for a film company in New
York when she met Bradley, who was nearing the end of his Knicks
career. She had never seen him play basketball. She laughs at the
recent ruckus over the feminist author Naomi Wolf advising Gore to
be an aggressive ``alpha male'' because, Mrs. Bradley said, she
wasn't sure exactly what kind of male her own husband was until she
saw him on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person, Bill was always gentle and kind and soft-spoken,
always considerate, and I would say to myself, `My gosh, I hope
they are not going to push him over,' '' Mrs. Bradley said. ``Then
when I saw him playing basketball, using these elbows and
everything else. I felt very good and thought, `That man is OK!'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very aggressive basketball player,'' Mrs. Bradley
recalled, ``so maybe he doesn't need to be an aggressive male off
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The alpha maleness of her husband definitely is not Mrs. Gore's
favorite subject. She will discuss his political record, his family
history, his positions on the issues with a gravity and authority
that clash with her perky, cheerleader image. But asked to comment
on Wolf's campaign advice, Mrs. Gore said: ``I am not going to go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please,'' she snapped. ``Number one, it's a media flap,
and number two, I think it's sexist. That is all I am going to say.
It's a distraction that nobody needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will she be trapped in what Mrs. Gore called ``a ridiculous,
National Enquirer kind of mentality'' that, in the wake of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, demands that politicians discuss the
intimacies of their marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in public life should be looked at and judged on their
records,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``We are focused, and we will continue
to be focused in this campaign. I am not going to let anything get
us off track.''

MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At 74, Rod Steiger has segued into an ongoing
string of paternal authority figure roles. Already this year, he
has been seen as a grandfather in ``Shiloh 2'' and a judge in
``Crazy in Alabama.'' On Wednesday, he'll be seen as a priest
aiding Arnold Schwarzenegger in the millennial devil movie, ``End
of Days.'' (Steiger mischievously offered to do a fight scene with
Schwarzenegger, but only if he won. It didn't happen.) Before the
year is out, Steiger will play a judge again, in ``Hurricane,''
opposite Denzel Washington's Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the
middleweight boxer imprisoned for nearly three decades before his
murder conviction was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   With his shaved head, sharp nose, and aviator glasses, the burly
Steiger, at the Palm Beach Film Festival earlier this year for a
career award, is a caricaturist's delight. He made his reputation
playing heavies or, at the very least, emphatic characters in ``On
the Waterfront'' (1954), ``The Big Knife'' (1955), ``Oklahoma!''
(1955), ``The Pawnbroker'' (1965), ``Doctor Zhivago'' (1965), and
``In the Heat of the Night'' (1967). In that film, his performance
as a Southern cop reluctantly partnered with Sidney Poitier's
Philadelphia detective won him an Oscar. His director in that film,
Norman Jewison, directed him in ``Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the only instance of things coming full circle for
Steiger. For decades, he was angry at Marlon Brando. The reason?
Brando wasn't there when Steiger shot his close-ups in ``On the
Waterfront.'' ``Because acting is reacting, I didn't get over it,''
Steiger recalls. ``Then last year in Montreal (where Steiger was
accepting another career award and Brando was filming), who sends
me this wonderful telegram but Brando? Then I get this note. I go
to a Chinese restaurant and sitting at a table is Mr. Brando. I
said to myself, `I guess I gotta thank him.' So we give big hugs
and I rub my bald head against his bald head, and I said, `I'm
really sorry you sent me the telegram because now I can't say any
more rotten things about you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Physically imposing though he still may be, Steiger allows his
face to soften more readily these days. He wears a gold medallion
into which is sculpted an image from Saint-Exupery's ``The Little
Prince,'' a favorite book that gave him hope. The medallion is also
engraved with the names of his grown daughter, his 7-year-old son,
and the date of his Oscar win. He speaks wistfully of hoping to
watch his son grow up. He writes poetry. Like another fabled movie
tough guy, Edward G. Robinson, he collects art, and has studied it.
Pushed to choose a favorite role, he cites the guilty Jewish
survivor he played in ``The Pawnbroker,'' adding that he stole his
unforgettable silent scream in that film from memories of Picasso's
``Guernica.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Steiger is making up for lost time _ eight years of
virtual immobilization from clinical depression. It got to a point,
he recalls, where he sat trying to figure out which method of
suicide would be the least messy. Eventually, he was led to
medication that corrected the chemical imbalance causing the
depression. His comeback film was ``The Specialist'' (1994),
opposite Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Steiger played a
Cuban criminal godfather in Miami. He has no illusions about the
quality of the film. ``It was like a $60 million commercial for
me,'' he says, chuckling. ``It said I was still alive.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Absent father &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steiger is also old enough to savor the irony in his current
string of father figures. ``My mother and father were a
song-and-dance team. I've never known my father. They split up in
my first year as a child. When I was on Broadway, in `Rashomon,'
somebody asked me what I would do if a man walked into my dressing
room and said he was my father. I said I didn't know. I probably
would go to pieces or (beat him up). I couldn't figure that one
out. Looking back, I lucked out. I was born on Long Island, in
Westhampton, but my mother moved to Newark. I was kind of on my own
since I was 10. My family was destroyed by alcohol. I grew up in
the Navy. I had one year of high school. I remember getting my
mother to sign a paper and lying about my age so I could enlist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served in the Pacific. I was on a destroyer. We escorted the
carriers. The Japanese would come in and spray us with bullets, but
they mostly would try to kamikaze the carriers. In the Philippines
we had a tornado that made the war look ridiculous. Waves 40 feet
high for three days. I learned that the wave doesn't go up. You go
down. Anyway, I survived the war. I fell into acting. I never
dreamed of being an actor. When I got out, my generation believed
you should make your own living if you're any kind of a man, find a
place you could sleep in that was fairly clean and you could pay
for. Somebody said civil service, they take veterans first. If you
have the IQ of a decimal point and you were a veteran, you were in.
I operated the check machine that sorted the canceled benefits
checks. Well, they had a theater group with all the pretty girls.
I'm talking a building that takes up a whole city block with about
8,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you'd ask one of the attractive women for a date,
they'd say, `I'm busy. I'm rehearsing.' Well, we found out about
the theater group and, needless to say, we descended like vultures.
We wanted to get lucky with the girls. So here we are, we're six
fiends, and somebody says, `What do you do?' And I said, look at
her, she's gorgeous, and I said, `I'm an actor.' So I started from
there and somebody told me to take it serious, and I did. I
realized I could get $85 a month and go to school, so I moved to
Manhattan and went to three different schools, the Actors Studio
included. I was in a play before I saw one. I gave myself two years
to just study and rehearse.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Steiger began appearing in plays, and on TV in that
medium's golden age, when live drama was shot on camera. The
live-TV experience was invaluable, he says, and became diluted when
TV went to tape. He was TV's original ``Marty'' and also played
Rasputin, Rudolf Hess, and Dutch Schultz for Walter Cronkite's
``You Are There.'' ``I love biography,'' Steiger says, ``studying
about all those people and their social settings. It's the best
possible education for an actor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A pass on `Patton' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steiger counts Al Capone, W. C. Fields, Napoleon, Hemingway, and
Mussolini among his favorite roles. ``I made many mistakes along
the way,'' he says, ``but the big one was after I had just gotten
the Academy Award and they sent me this script called `Patton.' And
I was this . . . pacifist (of sorts), and I said, `I'm not going to
do anything to glorify war.' I was a schmuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm fairly content. I got no complaints. Looking back, I
realize I had an incredible amount of rage. Because I felt my
family disappointed me. My mother! God help her. I learned later
that alcoholism was a disease. So the neighborhood used to laugh
and make jokes. I used to take her out of the bar and stuff like
that. But the last 12 years of her life, she went into AA and she
was one of the great sponsors they ever had. Anyway, I realize now,
somebody said to me, `Jesus! When you work, you're so intense. It's
abnormal. It's like your life or something.' And I realized only
two years ago that I'm trying to make sure the neighborhood never
laughs at the name of Steiger again. And I gotta tell you, I'll (do
anything) to make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rage came out, I'm happy to say, in a safe place. Had I
not been so fortunate to become an actor, I would have been one of
those people when they come into the bar, you try to get out
without him seeing you. And when he says, `What are you doing,
buddy?' you freeze and say, `Holy Christ, how am I going to get out
of this?' Somebody would have stuck a knife in my stomach when I
was 35 and that would be it.'' Not that Steiger's battles are
exactly over. Take, for example, his longstanding wish to direct.
It finally looks as if it's going to happen, with a film called
``Thanksgiving,'' about three aging lifelong friends. Steiger, who
wrote the film, will be one of its stars.
</P>
<P>
   Why so long? ``I've been asked to direct for 30 years. I mean,
I've had so many lunches, I felt I owned restaurants. Finally, the
last time a guy called, I said, `Look, let me save you the price of
a shrimp cocktail. I'll give you my whole theory of directing in
two words _ final cut.' Elizabeth Taylor said she'd like to do a
picture about Dorothy in Oz many years later. She said I saved her
life. That's an exaggeration, but a pleasant one. When I went to
see her about Oz, she was in bed, she hurt her back. I came back
two years later, she was in bed, resting. The third time, too.
Since my depression experience, I could tell isolation was
happening. So I said, `Would you like to go to lunch?' She said,
`I'd love to.' We went, we came back, and as I was leaving, the
staff said that except for AIDS benefits, that was the first time
she'd been out of the house in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she does the Dorothy-in-Oz picture. She's one of the
most courageous, naive in the best sense, romantic people I've met.
And intelligent. And funny. You can't be funny without
intelligence. People have written that we have a romance. We don't
have a romance,'' says Steiger, a veteran of four marriages and
four divorces. ``I don't plan on retiring, ever,'' he adds, not
that anyone was thinking he would. Like any good actor, especially
one who never does things in a small way, he has a vision of his
swan song. ``I want to just keel over and die while filming a
scene,'' he says. However it happens, he intends to have the last
word. His self-composed epitaph? ``See ya later.''

in London, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Sao Paulo and elsewhere,
brokers here will be trading directly from their own offices in a
kind of miniature Nasdaq. It is an impressive step, and one that
several Middle East stock markets are also expected to emulate in
the coming year. After long, sleepy histories, these stock
exchanges have caught the attention of government officials as
vital tools for selling state-owned companies and attracting
foreign investors as they move from centrally planned economies to
free enterprise. By Joseph B. Treaster.

RECONNECTING WITH DAVID MURRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Murray gets on a roll, his tenor saxophone
locks on to the rhythms of the earth. His notes cascade with an
unerring yet unpredictable flow, first with a volcanic fury, then
with a breeze, a sigh. He blows in phrases, each sentence complete.
Yet before marking that punctuation, his lines follow so jangled a
path, radiate in so many directions, they seem impossible to
resolve _ until, somehow, they are resolved, at which point, with
scarcely a breath, a new sentence, a new mystery, begins.
</P>
<P>
   The question puzzling many jazz fans in recent years: Whatever
happened to this guy?
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s, Murray staged his
musical-fireworks shows on a regular basis. He put out what seemed
like an album a month, led a half-dozen bands (duos, trios,
quartets, octets, big bands, funk groups), played sideman in
several more (most notably the World Saxophone Quartet). In New
York, you could see him play every Monday night at the Knitting
Factory, and only slightly less often at other clubs around town.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, he disappeared, flew off to Paris and Dakar,
joined up with Guadeloupean ka drummers, Djembe percussionists,
African rappers. A flurry of rumors circulated: He was fed up with
the Wynton-ized New York scene, he had tax troubles, he was fleeing
former wives or girlfriends. Whatever his reasons, went the
widespread whisper, Murray _ barely past 40 _ had given up the
ship, had abandoned not only America but jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He would still toss out the occasional tease. Last fall, he led
a big band and strings through some riveting arrangements of Duke
Ellington and Billy Strayhorn compositions. Now and then, with no
fanfare (who even knew he was in town?), he sat in on late-night
jam sessions at St. Nick's Pub in Harlem. Last month, he brought
his octet to the Iridium, one of Manhattan's most upscale jazz
clubs, to play his arrangements of John Coltrane's music (a CD of
which will be issued, on the Justin Time label, early next year).
</P>
<P>
   Some fans wondered: Could this be the start of a comeback, a
return to roots?
</P>
<P>
   Murray laughs at the question. As far as he's concerned, he
never left.
</P>
<P>
   He is sitting in his favorite Japanese restaurant in midtown
Manhattan a few hours before his Iridium gig begins. ``There's this
whole New York-centric thing,'' he says, shaking his head, ``this
idea that if it's not happening here, it's not happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not see me here, but I play someplace, with one of
my bands or another, every weekend. All summer, we did this
Ellington thing. I flew the big band across the Atlantic at least
12 times. If they couldn't make it, the octet did it. I talk with
people every day on the telephone. I know what's going on in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why did he leave the country? ``Because I met a woman, fell
in love, and we had a baby,'' Murray says. ``She lives in Paris, so
that's where I live.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Valerie Malet, was the chief assistant for the
biggest jazz organization in France, a government-subsidized group
that works with young people _ mostly African immigrants _ in the
impoverished suburbs of Paris. &QL; 
 &QL; 
His own kind of fusion &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murray met her on one of his bands' European tours. He
frequently conducts seminars when he tours, and in Paris, he got
particularly involved in Malet's group, organizing workshops,
combining the African pop music they knew with jazz standards and
some of his own compositions. He took the best dozen students to
Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Senegal, and linked them with young
musicians he had organized in similar workshops there.
</P>
<P>
   That link led to the Fo Deuk Revue, Murray's
Afro-Caribbean-funk-pop fusion band, which has toured widely, put
out two albums, and _ coinciding as it did with his romance and
subsequent move to Paris _ led many of his stateside followers to
conclude he'd left the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray insists, ``I'm just branching out. People try to keep
you in their box, they don't want you to branch out. But I don't
want to play with'' _ here he goes into a singsong speech pattern _
``this same quartet, these same three guys, that same riff, we're
going to make that same turnaround that same way. I don't want to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never stopped doing what I'm doing. I'm a jazz musician.
How can I stop playing jazz?''
</P>
<P>
   As Murray sees it, the change in scenery has done him nothing
but good. ``In New York, the phone is always ringing. . . . I have
more time in Paris to do research, read books. I have more time to
practice, too. I rarely practice less than two hours a day. I write
arrangements every day for a couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also currently organizing his next African project, in
Cameroon. ``They have a history of brass bands,'' he says. ``I'll
arrange traditional songs they know, with a jazz influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, I'm not sitting in a bar trying to learn French
and talking to everybody passing by. I'm over there working, every
day. I have problems sleeping because my brain keeps going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coltrane tribute is not a project he would have undertaken a
few years ago, for a variety of reasons. When Murray came of age on
the horn, in Oakland in the 1970s, tenor saxophone players tended
to model themselves after Coltrane or the other modern titan, Sonny
Rollins _ but rarely both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I knew was Coltrane-crazy, but I went the other way,
with Sonny,'' Murray recalls. ``I refused even to study Coltrane.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this split stemmed from the clash in loyalties that
erupts whenever two players compete for the crown, whether in jazz
or baseball. Part of it involved a radically different approach to
the main business of jazz _ improvisation. Coltrane elaborated on
the harmony of a tune, twisting and extending its chords to their
ultimate limits and building new chords, and variations on those
chords, on top of that. Rollins explored the melody, taking it
apart and piecing it back together in endless combinations, probing
the essence of a song. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Intent on melody &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``avant-garde'' musicians of his generation, Murray is
distinctive for how deeply he burrows into song forms. Few horn
players since Ben Webster blow a ballad more soulfully; even
Murray's more out-there excursions remain anchored to a melodic
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, melody is everything,'' he says. ``Lots of time, you
have guys play squeaks and squawks _ it's not connected to
anything. Everything I play is inside the structure. Every note has
to mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another reason for Murray's hesitation at approaching
Coltrane. ``I always felt a lot of people hit the wall because of
Trane,'' he says. ``It was clear why they got into it. Coltrane
created his own lexicon, he was the future. Here you are, sounding
like an automobile _ he's got a spaceship going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're flying a spaceship, navigation becomes a
different sort of art and, if you lose your grip for a second, you
get stuck in a rut's orbit or crash and burn into the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me this long _ I'm 44 years old _ to feel confident
enough to take on his music without its obliterating me as a
player,'' Murray says.
</P>
<P>
   He started by studying transcripts of ``Giant Steps'' and
``Countdown,'' Coltrane's toughest solos, and playing along with
the records. ``Listening to him is one thing,'' Murray says,
``playing it is another. Getting into Trane's mind _ that man's
computer was wired different from anybody's I'd ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he arranged harmonies, counterpoints, call-and-response
riffs for the rest of the octet. Then they rehearsed, improvising
further as their grasp of the material tightened.
</P>
<P>
   One night at the Iridium, as the octet plowed into the ethereal
first movement of ``A Love Supreme,'' Murray slipped into the zone
_ the one that modern jazz often aims for but rarely occupies _
where melody and harmony merge, the notes off the horn vaporize
into pure passion, pure velocity, and the band's staggered cadences
meld into the form of pure rhythm. It was Rollins transposed over
Coltrane. It was David Murray _ it was jazz _ at their most
electrifying.

WORTHY BIO OF A SENATE LION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- &UR;  &LR; To understand the importance of the best book
written about a significant legislator in ages _ Adam Clymer's
``Edward M. Kennedy'' _ here's a short tale about what the senator
does for a living that occurred too late for inclusion in Clymer's
definitive work.
</P>
<P>
   By semiofficial account, the latest Kennedy caper began in
January and ended last week. It began with a letter to the
bipartisan Medicare Commission (naturally, he arranged for
Republican co-writers) and ended in the last of the late-night
talks on Capitol Hill over a budget package.
</P>
<P>
   In between, you don't want to know how many meetings and
briefings Kennedy arranged between leading congressional figures
and leaders of hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care
front-liners. It is, however, worth noting that he had three
face-to-face meetings with President Clinton on the issue _ one in
late September, one in late October, and the last just three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was literally the health of the basic elements of the
health-care infrastructure, severely put at risk by the unexpected
impact on providers of cutbacks made two years ago in order to
produce the balanced budget deal. That impact was doubly severe in
states with disproportionately large health-care institutions that
serve national needs, not merely local ones _ as in Massachusetts,
which first elected Kennedy 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whennator started 10 months ago with just a few natural
allies, he had neither the ear of Congress's big shots nor the
initial sympathy of the Clinton administration. But by the time he
was finished, it was as if the two official ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue were competing to meet his exquisitely documented concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative package _ to improve the dangerously weakened
financial position of major teaching hospitals, nursing homes, home
health-care providers, and major pediatric facilities _ was worth
about $20 billion over 10 years when introduced in October by
Kennedy and Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. When the
last negotiating session concluded a week ago, the experts were
still figuring out details, but the figure I got was a cool $27
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the health-care infrastructure remains, but its
truly threatening severity has been significantly ameliorated. And
Kennedy will be back in the trenches next year.
</P>
<P>
   In his just-published book, Adam Clymer tells dozens of these
kinds of stories, many with warts attached, but most the kinds of
insight-loaded yarns that cause you to shake your head in
near-wonder. No one has ever bothered to do the hard work to piece
together a serious examination of the Kennedy's career and life _
yet he makes any short list of the most important legislative
figures in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer, a New York Times reporter, is one of those relentless
journalists who understands that the hard way, the inductive way,
is the best way. He loves the game with a passion but is one of the
few who can operate effortlessly in that critical area where
politics and policy mysteriously meet.
</P>
<P>
   In a silly age of buzz, hype, gossip, and garbage, Clymer's book
supplies an uplifting end to a somewhat shabby decade of American
biography. The triumphs, tragedies, successes, flops, and misdeeds
are all there in profound perspective. Clymer breaks enough new
ground to build a small city on. But one story, involving health
care, illustrates both Kennedy's most recent success and the roots
of his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   It involves Columbia Point, the failed public housing project in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood that back in 1966 produced at
least one huge success _ a health clinic. Simply by existing, the
clinic meant that mothers with kids had ready access to basic
services, instead of spending hours on buses and the subway getting
to facilities downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was there in August and in December, back when Medicare
and Medicaid were in their infancy. But he also had gotten a $51
million appropriation through Congress to help establish another 30
such neighborhood centers around the country. As Clymer tells it,
Kennedy carefully nurtured the effort until by 1995 there were some
850 clinics in urban and rural areas serving 9 million people.
</P>
<P>
   And for good measure, when Reagan tried to end it all, Kennedy
took him on (with carefully recruited Republican support as usual)
and clobbered him.
</P>
<P>
   Health care is a good for-instance, because the failure to
obtain national insurance is an enduring Kennedy frustration (his
first bill was introduced nearly 30 years ago). But he never gives
in, and he toils with the same grass roots mania he first displayed
organizing the West for his brother in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing only accomplishment and not longevity, and spanning
an incredible range of huge domestic and foreign policy concerns,
his full career is without parallel. In actual, measurable impact
on the lives of tens of millions of working familes, the elderly,
and the needy, Kennedy belongs in the same sentence with Franklin
Roosevelt.

A NECESSARY EVIL 
A History of American Distrust of Government 
By Garry Wills 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 366 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Weaver and David Koresh believed in armed
self-sufficiency. Among the materials found in Timothy McVeigh's
car after the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City was
a note containing the following sentence: ``Obey the Constitution
of the United States and we will not shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   All through American history since the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, and even before that, opponents of a
strong central government have often sought to justify their
opposition by suggesting that the philosophical underpinnings of
the nation harbor within them an antigovernment strain that is an
essential and healthy part of the national character.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Wills has taken upon himself the task of demolishing that
argument, and in ``A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust
of Government'' he generally succeeds. The Founding Fathers did not
design the federal government to be either weak or inefficient, and
did not plant in the Constitution the seeds of its own destruction,
Wills argues persuasively.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, James Madison is portrayed by Wills as fashioning
a constitution as strong as politically possible. He was trying,
Wills writes, ``to cut back on states' rights, offering palliatives
to the Antifederalists as a way of bringing back his own favorite
plan of federal power.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when modern insurrectionists, nullifiers, vigilantes,
and other opponents of the federal government point to the
Constitution itself for justification, Wills says, they usually
rely on the interpretations of the Antifederalists, who lost the
argument.
</P>
<P>
   An insightful historian and potent polemicist, and winner of the
1993 Pulitzer Prize for ``Lincoln at Gettysburg,'' Wills in this
book rolls out artillery that at times seems trained on a target
too small. McVeigh's act in Oklahoma City was horrible and
demented; how important is it to invalidate some of its rhetorical
trappings?
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Wills draws on sources ranging from Plato to Jefferson
to Mencken to antiabortion zealot Randall Terry _ a canvas that may
be viewed as impressively broad or as oddly scattered. Certainly
there are passages in which Wills bounds down a tangent to make a
point he is eager to get on paper. Reporters call this emptying the
notebook. Wills goes out of his way to attack columnist George Will
and several academicians, including Bruce Ackerman and Akhil Reed
Amar of Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a section on gun control, he wanders back to Tombstone
and Dodge City to counter Hollywood history, saying most cowboys
either had a rifle or were unarmed. ``Handguns were banned in the
cattle towns,'' he says. ``The `Wild West' was the birthplace of
strict gun control laws.'' After portraying a domesticated Wyatt
Earp who ``repaired boardwalks in the offseason,'' Wills goes on to
a scholarly examination of the Second Amendment, which he says is
regularly misinterpreted by the National Rifle Association and its
partisans. ``History, philology, and logic furnish no solid basis
for thinking the Second Amendment has anything to do with the
private ownership of guns,'' he says. This is not new. Robert Bork
has cited consistent Supreme Court rulings that ``there is no
individual right to own a firearm.'' But it is one of Wills's most
vigorous forays.
</P>
<P>
   A few others limp noticeably. One is Wills's fatuous suggestion
that the Vietnam War was actually lengthened by leftist protests,
based partly on the reflection that they hardened the editorial
opinion of the National Review. Another is the tortured logic
advanced by Wills to say that the Supreme Court, when it nullifies
a law passed by Congress, is not exercising a judicial prerogative
but a legislative one, because the Court was created by the
Constitution, a legislative document.
</P>
<P>
   Wills's own argument is that a strong federal government is a
necessary good, and that antigovernment values have victimized
``millions of poor or shelterless or medically indigent who have
been told, over the years, that they must lack care or life support
in the name of their very own freedom. Better for them to starve
than to be enslaved by `big government.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As we approach another presidential year, and the turn of the
calendar, Wills's is a worthwhile contribution to the national
debate.

A RABBI WITH ADVICE FOR JEWS WHO MARRY OUTSIDE THEIR RELIGION

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Mass. _ Given the title of Rabbi Devon Lerner's new
book _ ``Celebrating Interfaith Marriages'' _ you just know she is
going to rattle a few cages.
</P>
<P>
   For the average traditional Jewish parent, the prospect of an
interfaith marriage in the family is hardly cause to celebrate. The
Arlington rabbi has herself presided over a couple of interfaith
weddings in which the Jewish parents were so opposed to the
marriage that they refused to come to the ceremony. Rabbi Irwin
Fishbein showed up at one interfaith ceremony and discovered that
the groom, who was Jewish, had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family had held him in a motel till the ceremony was
over,'' says Fishbein, director of the Rabbinic Center for Research
and Counseling in Westfield, N.J., which collects data on
intermarrying couples.
</P>
<P>
   The examples, of course, are extreme cases. But the fact is that
the Jewish community generally has discouraged interfaith
marriages, and most rabbis refuse to officiate at them, either for
theological reasons or out of a belief that such marriages will
contribute to an erosion of the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Lerner approaches the matter from a different, less
emotional perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interfaith marriages are a fact of life,'' she states
matter-of-factly in the introduction to her book, a practical
manual for creating a Jewish/Christian wedding ceremony. ``Today
more than 50 percent of Jewish men and women are marrying
non-Jewish, mostly Christian partners. . . . I wrote this book to
help meet this growing demand and need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner's book deftly sidesteps the debate among religious
leaders about the propriety, or validity, of such marriages,
although she does suggest that, in general, Jewish clergy are more
opposed to or conflicted about them than Christian clergy are,
particularly Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the book is full of utilitarian advice about
nuts-and-bolts matters such as how to choose an officiant, types of
interfaith ceremonies, how to handle conflicting Jewish and
Christian traditions, suggested blessings and prayers, and small
details for planning an interfaith wedding, ranging from
``placement of the ritual items'' to ``who wears yarmulkes'' and
``lighting the unity candle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so few resources out there for couples who want to
honor both traditions in their weddings,'' says Lerner, who is both
a social worker and a rabbi ordained in the Reform branch of
Judaism. She has served congregations in Atlanta, Richmond, Va.,
and in Lexington. She has been officiating at interfaith ceremonies
since her ordination in 1979. ``It's too much to ask (interfaith)
couples to create their own ceremonies. They don't know where to
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner says she first confronted the issue more than 20 years
ago when her brother married a Christian and ``I realized I needed
to develop an understanding of this matter that felt important and
authentic to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has officiated at more than 200 interfaith
marriages, among them those in which one partner is Jewish and the
other is Catholic, Protestant, or Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Lerner does place stipulations on the weddings she
performs. One is that she will co-officiate with Christian clergy
only if ``there are no prayers said in Jesus's name. Some Jewish
people are uncomfortable with the name of Jesus and the presence of
the cross,'' she says, ``since historically many Jews have been
killed in Jesus's name.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will she marry every interfaith couple who knocks on her
door. ``One of my requirements is that the couple has to make a
decision about how they are raising their children,'' she says.
``It has to be one faith or the other, but not both. My experience
tells me that if you raise children in both religions, they will
grow up to be very tolerant of different religions, but they won't
have the traditions of either parent.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not shy about stating her preference that the kids be
brought up Jewish. ``I say to them, `Of course, I'm biased.' But I
honor their decision. My concern is that children will have a
religious grounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she knows that her stipulations would fail to appease
most other rabbis. Orthodox and Conservative rabbis refuse to
participate in interfaith ceremonies because they believe that
Jewish law forbids their involvement. And while 43 percent of
Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis (the liberal branches of
Judaism) do officiate at such weddings, according to a 1999 survey
of 1,929 rabbis conducted by the Rabbinic Center for Research and
Counseling, only about 10 such rabbis are in Greater Boston,
according to Rabbi Fishbein. ``New England happens to be very
conservative,'' he says. ``It just doesn't have a very strong
reform tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since most interfaith couples do not raise their children as
Jews, Reform rabbis often see each interfaith marriage as one less
Jewish family for the next generation,'' Lerner writes in the book.
It is a realistic concern, she notes, given that less than 3
percent of the American population is Jewish, and given that the
sting _ and the impact _ of the Holocaust is still very fresh for
Jews. ``Often,'' she says, ``I hear people say, `I don't want to
finish what Hitler was trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she understands these concerns, she doesn't share them
all. ``I'm not as worried as a lot of people are,'' she says. ``I
feel that if we have something to offer _ something precious _
Judaism will always be there. I've seen how interfaith marriages
really bring a lot of important insights into the Jewish community,
and revitalize us. I can't tell you the number of times I've heard
Jewish couples say that the Christian partner has gotten them more
involved in their Judaism, and made them think about their
traditions in new and positive ways.''
</P>
<P>
   She allows that her position on such marriages has placed her
``a little bit on the fringe'' of mainstream Jewish clergy,
``although not because I've gotten that feeling from my
colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucking tradition ``has been scary at times, but I get wonderful
feedback. I feel so strongly that this is the right thing to do. I
think it is important to be welcoming to people of different faiths
within the Jewish community. And the Jewish partners often feel
rejected if they can't find a rabbi to perform the ceremony. In any
wedding, the number one priority is the couple's relationship. If
they truly love one another and respond to each other's traditions,
they can have a wonderful life together.''

Y2K LONG SHOT: US-RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It would be the world's most extreme Y2K computer
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As improbable as it may be, the possibility of a mistaken launch
of nuclear missiles just as the world celebrates the new millennium
has antiatomic activists pushing anew for disarmament of all US and
Russian nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say flatly that Y2K computer problems will not
cause any accidental launch of a nuclear missile.
</P>
<P>
   But arms control specialists cannot completely rule out a Y2K
doomsday scenario, which could start with computer malfunctions in
Russia that cause early-warning systems to give erroneous
indications of a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under this hypothetical scenario, Russian President Boris
N. Yeltsin could order the activation of the country's ``dead
hand'' system, which ensures nuclear retaliation in case an attack
kills the entire Moscow leadership. Next, the Y2K bug could shut
down the communication between Russia's central command and the
dead hand computer apparatus, which would proceed to launch
missiles on the basis of the false indications of an incoming
attack.
</P>
<P>
   And that, according to some disarmament activists, could bring
nuclear holocaust as Russia sends hundreds of nuclear missiles
toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Much would have to go wrong for such a cataclysmic event to
occur, but such technical and human error is not absolutely out of
the question, some arms specialists warn.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, to add another layer of safety to prevent an
accidental launch, President Clinton and Yeltsin created a joint
Y2K control room at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.
There Russian and US officials will sit side-by-side beginning in
late December to minimize the chances of a Y2K-triggered false
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But the scenario described above is based on a ``Dr.
Strangelove''-like system that exists in Russia, notably the dead
hand computer program, which remains in the hands of Moscow despite
the joint command center in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   And the scenario comes against a backdrop of rising Russian
anger against the United States, the most recent point of conflict
occurring last week in Clinton's pointed criticism of the war in
Chechnya. Pentagon officials say Russia has embarked on a campaign
of nuclear muscle-flexing to show its displeasure, including a
recent test of two submarine-launched missiles and Russia's threats
to send nuclear bombers to Cuba and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But an ongoing worry persists around Russia's deteriorating and
incomplete early-missile warning system, underscoring the dangers
of having an estimated 5,000 Russian and US nuclear missiles on a
hair-trigger _ Y2K or no Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   While the missiles are no longer targeted on cities and nuclear
sites, they are loaded with guidance systems that, on the United
States side, can be programmed in as little time as 10 seconds,
literally a flip of the switch and then two computer keystrokes,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the Y2K risks are low, it's important for people to
appreciate the overall risks here,'' said Bruce Blair, a Brookings
Institution senior fellow and a recipient this year of a MacArthur
Foundation ``genius grant,'' who has written extensively about
possible doomsday nuclear scenarios, including the dead hand
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Blair and others, Y2K is a unique event, and thus
the threat cannot be calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inestimable,'' Blair said. ``Anyone who claims to know
the probability of Y2K early-warning failure in Russia is pulling
it out of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, US and Russian officials have tried to assure
the public that Y2K poses no risk of a nuclear shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
   Following a federal government report on the Y2K problem earlier
this month, the White House said in a statement: ``Y2K problems
will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves. Nuclear
weapons launch requires human intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the worries of Y2K problems with Russia's nuclear system
``have gotten blown way out of proportion. We expect minor glitches
in Russia, nothing of great severity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Colorado center, American officials will share data from
the US global early warning network.
</P>
<P>
   But distrust lingers, even at the joint command center. US
officials will not share everything from the early-warning network
for fear of giving away secrets to the Russians, and the Russians
have rejected US requests to set up another joint Y2K control
center in Russia because of their own wariness of giving away
intelligence secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Ill feeling has gradually built up between the two nation's
militaries since the early euphoria following the breakup of the
Soviet Union. It deepened among the Russian military hierarchy in
recent months with the expansion of NATO eastward to include three
more countries; with NATO's war against Serb forces in Kosovo; and
with US intentions to build a national missile defense system that
would violate the antiballistic missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Five US arms control specialists, some working for the Clinton
administration or Congress and some at universities, have said
recently that their contacts in Russia have dried up because
Russian intelligence agents have told scientists to cease contacts
with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the possible Y2K threat has galvanized many
antinuclear activists, including Helen M. Caldicott, author
Jonathan Schell, and former arms negotiator Paul Nitze, who have
called on Clinton in full-page newspaper advertisements to
``de-alert'' thousands of nuclear missiles. De-alerting literally
means taking missiles off high alert, removing the hair trigger by
dismantling missile components.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts
Democrat, introduced a resolution calling for immediate de-alerting
of nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But US and Russian officials have rejected the idea. US Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen said in Moscow recently that de-alerting
was ``off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles, according to Pentagon officials and arms control
specialists, lie in verification and lack of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the US and Russia see each as potential
adversaries, this is going to be the situation'' of missiles on
hair-trigger, said Theodore A. Postol, a MIT professor of science,
technology, and national security policy. ``That will also be the
situation if one side sees itself as vulnerable to a damaging
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   That now would be Russia, because its nuclear forces are
``extremely vulnerable to a US strike,'' Postol said. Many Russian
nuclear missiles are either in silos or are collected together in
corrugated steel buildings, making them a possible lucrative target
in a nuclear war. Many US nuclear missiles, in comparison, are on
submarines, which can evade detection.
</P>
<P>
   A US arms control official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said de-alerting would be extremely difficult in practice because
of the difficulty of verification. ``You have to imagine all sorts
of shenanigans there would be over verification,'' the official
said. ``Once you mention the word `verification,' the idea loses
some of its attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some arms control analysts, there seems little reason to
keep so many missiles on high alert a decade after the fall of the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the threat? Does anybody think there is going to be a
bolt-out-of-the-blue attack?'' said Joseph Cirincione, senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a
Washington think tank. ``Does anyone believe that the Russians
would do this for some reason, that they would try to do a
preemptive strike? I think it's just insane at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, the Brookings analyst who has had extensive contacts with
Russian counterparts, said while both the United States and Russia
find a preemptive strike scenario ``bizarre,'' the issue cannot be
totally dismissed because of Russia's rising distrust of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Y2K doomsday scenario, which has been so roundly
dismissed by US officials, was cause for losing sleep, Blair did
not respond reassuringly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you sleep at night? Why should you sleep if nobody
knows? Maybe you need a sleeping pill,'' he said. ``You can hope
and trust that the probability is extremely small. But we certainly
don't know that.''

   SCI-MEREDITH-WINE (Davis, Calif.) _ Dr. Carole P. Meredith, a
geneticist at the University of California's department of
viticulture and enology, has used a new method of unraveling the
grapevine's tangled family tree to demonstrate that several of the
world's best-known wine grapes are not pure strains but hybrids
between other varieties. Recognizing that the DNA fingerprinting
method used in forensic cases could be adapted to the vine, she has
roamed through the leading Californian and French varieties,
conducting paternity tests and establishing quite unexpected
liaisons between grapes of very different repute. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ At Beth Israel Medical Center in
Manhattan, a different kind of support group for women with breast
cancer has formed, one in which the patients and their partners are
all women. The notion that lesbians need or want a separate support
group may seem puzzling to the larger heterosexual world, but the
women who met at Beth Israel said they needed their own group not
because they were uncomfortable with straight women, but because
straight women were uncomfortable with lesbians. By Denise Grady.

   SCI-GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ American and Australian
scientists are reporting evidence that the biggest global warming
in the last 100 million years may have been touched off by a sudden
blowout of greenhouse gases from the ocean floor around 55 million
years ago. The warming wiped out many species of marine life and
created climatic conditions that led to an explosive expansion in
the number and variety of mammal species. Those who have
investigated the ancient warming spike say it reinforces a belief
that has lately been growing among climate scientists: that a
gradual warming of the climate can abruptly soar to new heights
once a certain threshold is reached. By William K. Stevens. (1220

embracing healing methods once dismissed as alternative medicine
and combining them with standard treatment. By Leslie Berger. (1350

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Hot
flashes are a staple of menopause, experienced by at least 75
percent of American women at some point. Estrogen in appropriate
doses can eliminate them, but millions of menopausal women cannot
or will not take it. For such women, there are a number of simple,

   SCI-DRINKING-WATER (Undated) _ Industrial solvents and related
chemicals are present in the ground water used to provide drinking
water for 35 million to 50 million Americans, according to the
United States Geological Survey, which is about to publish the
first national report card on the presence of these chemicals. The
chemicals, called volatile organic compounds, generally occur in

FEDERAL DRUG AGENCY BATTLES LEGALIZATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA

 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voters in California, Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, Nevada,
Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized the use of
marijuana for medical reasons. It hasn't made any difference to the
Drug Enforcement Administration. To the DEA, marijuana is a
Schedule I drug, and, therefore, must be strictly regulated by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Controlled Substance Act of 1970 also listed peyote, a
hallucinogenic cactus button, as a Schedule I drug. But Congress
exempted the Native American Church from the prohibition against
the use of peyote. Members of NAC use peyote as a sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also allowed states to create their own exemptions for
the use of peyote. In Arizona, members of The Peyote Way of God and
The Peyote Foundation can use peyote. In Minnesota, members of the
American Indian Church can use peyote as a sacrament. In Oregon,
those with sincere religious intent may use peyote. In Colorado,
New Mexico and Nevada, those who are members of bona fide religious
organizations may use peyote as a religious sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   One can be exempt from the legal restrictions on a Schedule I
drug for religious reasons, but not for health reasons. There's
something seriously wrong here.
</P>
<P>
   The medical marijuana prosecutions in California are a warning
to the tens of thousands of seriously ill citizens who use
marijuana to ease their pain and nausea. The case of author and
publisher Peter McWilliams of Los Angeles is illustrative of how
federal drug agents and federal prosecutors are targeting those who
are ill and using state authorized medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of his ability to defend himself in a federal trial, on
advice of counsel, McWilliams has thrown himself to the mercy of
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McWilliams was diagnosed with AIDS and the AIDS-related
cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In that same year, California
passed Proposition 215, which allows seriously ill patients, with a
doctor's recommendation, to grow and use marijuana. McWilliams was
arrested by federal drug agents and originally charged with
numerous marijuana crimes.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams used marijuana to control his nausea with his AIDS
medications. It's the only anti-nausea drug that has worked well
for him. Since his arrest, McWilliams' health has declined
precipitously because he has had to use an anti-nausea drug that is
much less effective for him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge George H. King ruled that McWilliams
could not mention his illness or Proposition 215 in his defense
during the trial. The judge also ruled that McWilliams could not
argue medical necessity as a defense. In other words, McWilliams
was not allowed to defend himself in court. According to
McWilliams, it's the draconian nature of the laws in drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Nov. 19, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture
and distribute marijuana. In the plea agreement, McWilliams waived
his right to appeal. He now faces a maximum of five years in
federal prison. At the scheduled hearing on Feb. 28, Judge King, if
he is so inclined, can take McWilliams' health into account and
give him less time in prison _ or even home detention. McWilliams
sees any mandatory prison time as a probable death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   That's the warning to the citizens of America: Cross the federal
marijuana laws and your state laws won't protect you. It doesn't
matter if you suffer from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma or multiple
sclerosis; you will end up in prison. Non-violent marijuana
offenders often receive longer prison sentences than those who
commit violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report from the National Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Medicine acknowledges that ``marijuana's active
components are potentially effective in treating pain, nausea, the
anorexia of AIDS wasting, and other symptoms.'' The federal drug
czar, Barry R. McCaffrey, in a Nov. 16 debate on ABC News, said the
report ``condemned the dangers of smoking marijuana.'' It didn't.
The report says that dangers to health associated with chronic
smoking of marijuana ``awaits the results of well-designed
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the popular movement to legalize the use of
medical marijuana continues. The states of Massachusetts, Minnesota
and New Hampshire have legislation pending that would legalize the
use of marijuana to treat the effects of serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And the state Senate in Hawaii has adopted a resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to pass legislation allowing individual states to
determine their own policies with regard to medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., introduced a bill in the U.S. House
(HR 912 _ Medical Use of Marijuana Act) on March 2, in order to
move marijuana from a Schedule I drug of the Controlled Substances
Act to a Schedule II drug of the act. The bill would allow ``the
prescription or recommendation of marijuana by a physician for
medical use,'' and allows ``producing and distributing marijuana
for such purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's bill has 11 co-sponsors, only one a Republican, Rep. Tom
Campbell of California. Currently, the bill languishes in the House
Subcommittee on Health and Environment. Meanwhile, citizens who are
ill face drug prosecution if they turn to medical marijuana, as
provided by state law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the DEA's chief administrative law judge, Francis L.
Young, ruled that because marijuana is a safe therapeutically
active substance, marijuana must be transferred from a Schedule I
to a Schedule II drug, according to the Controlled Substances Act.
Schedule I drugs have no known medical use. The judge wrote: ``It
would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to
continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this
substance.'' That was 11 years ago _ nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Drug busts often lead to the defendant losing most of his
property to forfeiture laws. Since the Clinton administration made
marijuana busts its priority, according to the National
Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws (NORML), someone is arrested
on a marijuana charge every minute.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1980 the Justice Department bragged that it had
obtained drug-related forfeitures that amounted to over $90
million. Clearly marijuana and other drug busts are a cash cow that
the federal drug agencies don't want to give up. No wonder the DEA
resists moving marijuana to a Schedule II drug.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the people to act in their states and petition
Congress to pass the Medical Use Marijuana Act.

geneticist at the University of California's department of
viticulture and enology, has used a new method of unraveling the
grapevine's tangled family tree to demonstrate that several of the
world's best-known wine grapes are not pure strains but hybrids
between other varieties. Recognizing that the DNA fingerprinting
method used in forensic cases could be adapted to the vine, she has
roamed through the leading Californian and French varieties,
conducting paternity tests and establishing quite unexpected
liaisons between grapes of very different repute. By Nicholas Wade.

created climatic conditions that led to an explosive expansion in

STATE, FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SENDING TEAMS TO MONTANA MINING TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ State and federal authorities say they will send
teams of health and environmental investigators to this tiny
northwestern Montana town to evaluate whether asbestos from a
closed mine still threatens its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Montana Gov. Mark Racicot and EPA Region 8 Administrator Bill
Yellowtail both expressed concern after the Post-Intelligencer
reported last week that 192 people have died and 375 more have been
diagnosed with fatal diseases because of the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the people of Libby to know that we take very seriously
these threats to their health and we are going to bring to bear the
resources of EPA to solve the problem and prevent further harm,''
Yellowtail said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement released by his office, Racicot said,
``The state of Montana is concerned about the recent disclosures of
the public-health issue in the Libby area.''
</P>
<P>
   Tons of asbestos were released into the air during more than six
decades of vermiculite mining at Zonolite Mountain, three miles
east of Libby. The W.R. Grace Co., which owned the mine for 30
years, closed it in 1990 and sold the property four years later.
</P>
<P>
   After many Libby residents told the Post-Intelligencer of their
fears that the dangers still exist, the newspaper took air and soil
samples on a public road near the abandoned mine's tailing pile.
When analyzed by EPA-certified laboratories, the samples showed the
presence of tremolite, the rare type of asbestos that is found in
the vermiculite ore from the mountain, at levels far beyond
federally established safety limits.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer also reported that documents from Grace
and the state showed that asbestos had washed into the Kootenai
River, which flows through Libby, and more is likely to wash into
the scenic river during next year's snow melt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply distressed by these revelations,'' Yellowtail
said. ``We are mobilizing in cooperation with the State of Montana
to investigate the reports of asbestos contamination in Libby.''
</P>
<P>
   Libby officials, including Mayor Tony Berget, told the
Post-Intelligencer last week that they believe there is no
continuing danger. If there were, they say, Racicot, who is from
Libby, would have told them.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the Montana Department of Environmental
Quality and the state health department ``will be sending teams''
to a public meeting in Libby on Dec. 1 ``to address the concerns of
the local residents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be able to identify which entities should be
involved in the process to address this issue as well as determine
what precisely that process should be,'' the governor's statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's leading environmental group, the Montana
Environmental Information Center, said it was ``less than
impressed'' with the governor's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc Racicot has ignored repeated requests from his former
neighbors to help fix the problem here and, for all too long he has
remained silent,'' said Jim Jensen, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is over for the finger-pointing around the table. We
can no longer tolerate everyone saying the health of the citizens
of Libby is someone else's responsibility,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public exposure of the issue in the newspapers has
obviously forced the governor to take this situation seriously for
the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said ``it's great that the EPA is finally sending in the
cavalry, because the state of Montana does not have the money to do
this job.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the EPA should bring in its Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the EPA's job and it's their moral obligation to clean
up the contamination so that this community and its children and
grandchildren can have healthy and hope-filled futures.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen and other environmental health experts say the focus of
EPA's team and other investigators must be on whether the people of
Lincoln County are still at risk from the sparsely covered tailings
pile at the mine and from the asbestos that may still contaminate
parts of downtown Libby. It was there that Grace bagged and shipped
the vermiculite material they marketed as Zonolite, and
experimented with the asbestos to see if it had a marketable use.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some miners and their family members died or
became ill after working at the mine is no secret. W.R. Grace still
insists it did nothing wrong, adding that it spent millions of
dollars in improvements at the mine and was responsible to the
workers and the community. But it admits that exposure to tremolite
caused deaths and illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   People exposed during the operation of the mine will continue to
die for decades, doctors say. The latency period, the time from
when exposure occurs to when the disease is diagnosed, is often 20
to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the most stringent laws nor the most dedicated
investigators can do anything about those exposed years ago. Once
the disease gets a firm foothold, its path is predictable. The only
question that remains is what form will the eventual death take _
asbestosis, mesothelioma, lung cancer or failure of the heart
weakened by the diseased lungs.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive epidemiological study would be the only way to
determine the actual numbers of people who died or contracted
disease from exposure to tremolite from the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight was the number of deaths used in many of the civil
actions brought against Grace. The number was identified by Dr.
Alan Whitehouse, who treated hundreds of workers from the mine and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse, a highly credentialed lung specialist, said in court
testimony that the figure of 88 ``was conservative'' and came from
his study of death certificates where he was able to study the
corresponding medical records.
</P>
<P>
   It was rare, even in the 1970s and '80s, for death certificates
to list the cause of death as asbestos-related. Many just listed
``cancer'' or ``heart failure'' or some other diagnosis which
offered no clue to the deceased person's exposure to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer was able to expand the number of deaths
to 192 by comparing the names on Whitehouse's list with information
from interviews with surviving family members and physicians at
several major Northwest hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But even that number may be low.
</P>
<P>
   People from across the country who read the Post-Intelligencer's
stories have called or e-mailed the newspaper with sometimes
tearful reports of their loved ones from Libby who died after
working at the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Others told the newspaper about family members who had died from
diseases related to tremolite, but were not miners.
</P>
<P>
   The families of three men who worked for Burlington Northern on
the hundreds of trains that carried ore from Libby attributed the
men's deaths to asbestos exposure. The family of a Montana highway
department worker who often worked near Libby called to say that
the man had died of an asbestos-related disease.

 &HT;    GEORGIA REPUBLICAN TRAVELING WITH CLINTON FIND HIMSELF IN
STRANGE, FRIENDLY WATERS
 &HT;    (350&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With CLINTON-1123.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Georgia Republican Jack Kingston had his
doubts about touring southern Europe with President Clinton and
several hundred of the Democratic Party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressman has found his comfort zone expanding on a
trip that has taken him from Athens to Florence to Sofia since
Friday, as one of a handful of congressional guests of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Being whisked through the wonders of the ancient world aboard
the modern magic carpet of Air Force One, after all, has its
pluses.
</P>
<P>
   When Kingston got off the world's most famous Carolina blue and
white jumbo jet Sunday night in Sofia, he was welcomed by an honor
guard, dressed in high boots and ceremonial caps with long
feathers, rolling out the red carpet _ literally _ to the stirring
music of a military band.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the commercial flight Kingston took a few
days earlier _ the airline lost his luggage, Kingston said _ en
route to Athens, where he linked up Friday with Clinton's
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Kingston wound up at a dinner with Clinton, his
National Security Advisor Samuel Berger, Chief of Staff John
Podesta and a dozen other Clinton confidantes at the Tzar Ivan
Assen II National Rotisserie Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dined on goose livers _ ``to prove I'm a real
Bulgarian,'' he said _ but Kingston was more impressed with the
ambience than the local cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. He was seated beside Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, and
the two passed a memorable evening, he recalled, warmed by a
hickory fire and the soothing strains of a Strauss waltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great conversation,'' said Kingston, a father of
four. ``She's a bright young lady and very balanced, and loves her
mom and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he stopped by an upscale crafts arcade in downtown
Sofia top pick up some trinkets for the folks back home _ some
silver filigree butterflies and crosses, and a brightly colored
lacquered box.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no time for shopping,'' said Kingston, who represents
constituents along the Georgia coast, ``so I'm just clearing the
shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, a guy could get used to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing,'' confided Kingston, who voted a year ago to
throw Clinton out of office. ``I never met so many nice Democrats.
It's scaring me.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He even had kind words to say about his one-time political
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference Sunday in Florence to discuss progressive
governance with several of his European counterparts, Clinton stole
the show, Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question that the president was center stage,''
said Kingston, who is on the trip representing House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. Kingston sits on three Appropriations
subcommittees, including Foreign Operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just no question that when the president spoke,''
Kingston said, ``his vision, which is worldwide, was respected.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been all glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand demonstrators turned out to protest Clinton's visit
to Athens _ none came near Kingston or Clinton _ where Kingston met
with Greek opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed, among other things, Greek-Turkish tensions on
the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cyprus question is a tough one,'' Kingston said. ``But the
Greek people were appreciative of the fact that the president was
there, despite the demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent last week in Istanbul and Ankara, is trying
to broker peace between long-term rivals Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a remarkable rapport with both countries,''
Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get one more glimpse of the Clinton charm abroad when he
travels with the president on Tuesday to neighboring Kosovo.
Clinton led his NATO allies in a 78-day air war last spring to
drive out Serb troops and paramilitary thugs who were raping,
killing and otherwise terrorizing the ethnic Albanian majority
there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to give a speech to citizens of Kosovo then host a
Thanksgiving week meal for some of the 6,300 U.S. peacekeeping
troops stationed in the cold and bleak Yugoslav province. He's
almost certain to get a hero's welcome _ more good news for
Kingston to report back home to Speaker Hastert.

MOSQUE

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The doors of the Holy Land's most revered churches
were closed Monday in a historic protest that left pilgrims caught
in the middle of a religious dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On the stone streets of Jerusalem's Old City, monks stood in
their doorways and told inquiring visitors they were ``on strike.''
Church workers shouted down foreigners trying to pray in the
courtyard of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, believed to the site
of Christ's crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the Old City at Dormition Abbey, the site of the
Virgin Mary's eternal sleep, a flyer on the closed iron gates
stated, ``Thank You for Understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while the holy family found shelter in a Bethlehem manger
2,000 years ago, the iron door to the church now at that site was
shut Monday. Regular worshippers were allowed in most sites but
foreign pilgrims and tourists, despite having traveled thousands of
miles, were not.
</P>
<P>
   Father Claudius Baratto, spokesman for the Franciscan Custody of
the Holy Land, said it was likely the first time in history that
the approximately 30 shrines of his order were voluntarily closed.
Some of the sites, mainly in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth,
date back to the Fourth Century.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian
churches called the two-day strike. It was to protest the proposed
construction of a mosque near the principle church in Nazareth, the
biblical town of Christ's youth. Muslims in the largely Arab city
demand that a large mosque be built close to the Roman Catholic
Basilica of the Annunciation.
</P>
<P>
   The closure comes at a tense time, when local authorities and
churches are starting to see the arrival of millions of pilgrims
and tourists expected in the millennial year.
</P>
<P>
   Christian denominations have long squabbled among each other at
the holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have so far failed to persuade the
denominations at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher to install an
emergency exit, even though severe crowding already occurs. Many
roads and buildings are still under construction in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of Jewish-Christian friction have surfaced as well. The
government's Chief Rabbinate recently warned hotels they could lose
their Kosher certification if they display Christmas trees in
public places. Many Jewish Israelis opposed the Christmas tree
decree. But, a Rabbinate official, Yaakov Sabag, said the trees
could insult some Jews ``like the Swastika hurts peoples'
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   While Catholic and orthodox churches were closed Monday,
Protestant holy sites, visited mainly by foreigners, stayed open.
There are relatively few local Protestants and they have not been
heavily involved in the Nazareth dispute. But, some foreign
evangelical Protestants openly blame the Muslims for the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The church closings signaled the increased pressures of the
millennium. The debate over Nazareth has been going on for two
years, with Muslims constructing a prayer tent near the proposed
mosque site and staging protests. On Easter, riots broke out in
which stores and homes of Christian Arabs were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Local Catholic leaders, meanwhile, have threatened to try to
cancel the expected March visit to Israel of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 100,000 Christian Arabs in Israel, mostly
Greek Orthodox and Catholic, find themselves outnumbered 9 to 1 by
Muslims and often find the growing number of mosques intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed mosque is planned to be taller than the large
Basilica of the Annunciation. Catholics fear that it will
overshadow the church and disrupt it with loud-speakers sounding
the call to prayer. They planned to use the area, which a court
ruled was state land, as a visitors plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to mediate the dispute, the Israeli government
proposed that the mosque be built on a third of the land, but after
the millennial year 2000. Also, the Muslims were required to take
down their prayer tent. On Tuesday, the Israeli government is
allowing the Muslims to lay a cornerstone for the new mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Interior Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami has promised, also, to
build a police station on the plaza to provide safety.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly pledged to work with both sides on finding a
solution. But, the current compromise does not satisfy the concerns
of the Catholic leaders, supported by Greek Orthodox and Armenian
churches.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse Israeli officials of trying to divide the Arab
community and use the church dispute to win over Muslim voters.
They say relations have been good between most Muslims and
Christians, but that Israeli officials have encouraged extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government supported a small group of fundamentalists who
are intent on building a mosque only a few meters away from the
historic church,'' the church leaders wrote in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it clear discrimination against the Christian
community,'' they wrote. ``It is equally an abandonment of the rule
of the law by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sad, very sad,'' said Metropolitan Timothy(cq no
family name), a leading bishop in the Greek Orthodox Church. ``I
don't know what will be the effect, but this is the only way the
community found to express our sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists and pilgrims were both disappointed and puzzled by the
closed doors. Outside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where
Catholics believe Christ was crucified, groups stood before the
massive metal doors.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried to pray in the courtyard, which is only allowed on
Good Friday. No exceptions were made today, as church workers
threatened to remove anyone praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion should unite people, not keep them apart,'' Merlin
St. Martin, visiting from London, England.
</P>
<P>
   At Protestant sites, the traffic was heavy as usual. The Garden
Tomb, where Protestants believe Christ was crucified, was crowded
with the usual busloads of pilgrims, including a group from Hobe
Sound, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different faiths should have the freedom to visit the
sites they wish,'' said Cliff Churchill, 47, the academic dean at
the Hobe Sound Bible College.

A-TO-Z LOOK AT GRAND CAYMAN 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Grand Cayman _ The jingle rattles in your head:
``The Cayman Islands. ... Those who know us love us. ... The Cayman
Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   But just what do you know of these three little islands about
150 miles south of Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the Caymans consist of 76-square-mile Grand
Cayman, home to George Town, the country's capital; 15-square-mile
Cayman Brac; and 11-square-mile Little Cayman. Total population is
about 35,000, most of whom embrace their continuing status as a
British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Though small, the islands boast some of the world's best
snorkeling and diving, a standard of living and a literacy rate
that are among the highest in the Caribbean, and a refreshingly
friendly approach to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   To jump-start your love affair, we offer an A-to-Z look at Grand
Cayman, the most frequently visited island.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A _ ACCESSIBLE
</P>
<P>
   Cayman Airways flies Boeing 737s and prepares passengers for an
island holiday by serving complimentary rum punch and other fruity
concoctions. Call 800-422-9626; access www.caymanairways.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B _ BEACHES
</P>
<P>
   Miles and miles of platinum-colored shores make Grand Cayman a
beachcomber's paradise. The most popular is Seven Mile Beach, a
striking mix of fine hotels, festive dining and nonstop water
sports _ with nary a bothersome vendor in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Its name is a bit of a stretch, as the beach is only 5 1/2 miles
long. If you are not staying at one of the condominium or resort
hotels along this area, a lovely public beach has ample parking, a
picnic area, a playground and restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   C _ CONCH RULES
</P>
<P>
   You can fritter away hours of your vacation sampling the many
versions of the popular fried dumplings known as conch fritters. Or
try conch chowder, marinated conch, conch cocktail, cracked conch,
conch stew and conch ceviche.
</P>
<P>
   Conked by conch? Other traditional Caribbean fare here includes
turtle, oxtail, johnnycakes and meat pies.
</P>
<P>
   And don't skip breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   As a British colony, the Caymans enjoy the traditional English
breakfast. Stop by one of the island's many pubs for a ``fry-up,''
with its heart-stopping portions of sausage, bacon, fried eggs,
black pudding, mushrooms, baked beans and baked tomatoes. At the
Landmark, a second-floor pub serves breakfast to soccer fans who
gather around big-screen TVs. Call 345-949-2582.
</P>
<P>
   For an even more exotic experience, stop by the Champion House,
where locals line up for ladles of traditional Caymanian breakfast
fare such as boiled dumplings, braised kidneys, chicken gizzards,
boiled green bananas, rice and beans, fried plantains and pastries
_ all served buffet-style.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the habit-forming hominy and corn-meal porridge; the
callalou, resembling spinach in taste and texture; and the ackee
and codfish, a pungent saute of salty codfish, peppers, garlic,
onion and ackee, a red fruit native to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be surprised that, despite the bustle, the dining room
is empty. Islanders prefer their breakfast to go. Call
345-949-7882.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D _ DIVE IN
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Cayman Islands visitors report that they come
for the crystal-clear waters, healthy coral reefs and diverse
marine life that create ideal diving and snorkeling conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder: Grand Cayman is the birthplace of Caribbean
diving, which began with a single dive shop in 1957. Today, more
than 40 companies provide services here. Divers can select from
more than 130 sites, many less than a half mile from shore. Most
dives concentrate on undersea cliffs where marine life flourishes
and visibility ranges up to 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A recommended reference is ``Lonely Planet's Pisces Diving and
Snorkeling Guide to the Cayman Islands'' (Lonely Planet, $14.95).

</P>
<P>
   E _ Eeeeee!
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound snorkelers make when they brush up against
their first stingray.
</P>
<P>
   The Caymans offer an opportunity to see exotic sea creatures
such as eels, sharks, stingrays and sea turtles without wandering
too deep or too far from shore.
</P>
<P>
   In the shallows of Grand Cayman's North Sound is a remarkable
place called Stingray City. Here dozens of Atlantic Southern
stingrays swarm, looking for handouts as delighted snorkelers
squeal with excitement. The rays, some as wide as 5 feet, are
harmless unless you step on them or grab them by their whiplike
tails.
</P>
<P>
   A Stingray City sandbar provides a spot for nonswimmers to
``play'' with the stingrays.
</P>
<P>
   Several snorkeling/diving tour operators offer excursions to
Stingray City, varying in price according to the number of snorkel
sites. A half-day tour with three stops starts at about $25. We
used Capt. Marvin's Watersports (345-945-4590).
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman Islands Department of Tourism publishes an excellent
full-color guide that describes dozens of sites for snorkelers of
all abilities. Call 800-346-3313.

<P>
   F _ FISHING
</P>
<P>
   Anglers are attracted to the Cayman Islands by their abundance
of gamefish such as wahoo, dolphin, blue marlin and tuna, many of
which can be found as little as a quarter-mile offshore. More than
a dozen outfitters specialize in shore, reef and deep-sea fishing
excursions.
</P>
<P>
   While local fishing tournaments are popular, the big event is
the Cayman Islands International Fishing Tournament each spring.
The 2000 event is scheduled April 29-May 7, and a $250,000 cash
award awaits the angler who can top the tournament's 584-pound
record for blue marlin.

   G - GOLF RELIEVES GREEN ENVY
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean World magazine's readers have voted the Links at Safe
Haven the best golf course in the Caribbean for two consecutive
years. Designed by Roy Case, the 18-hole, par-71 championship
course may be more blue than green, with water hazards dominating
all but two holes. For a tee time, call 345-949-5988.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of golf, retire to the Links' restaurant, where
panoramic views and a French-Asian fusion of flavors make for a
memorable meal. Keep it light _ perhaps chilled tropical gazpacho
and a Caesar salad topped with blackened chicken _ so you'll have
room for the raspberry sorbet. Dinner specialties include roasted
duck and grilled ostrich sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency's Britannia Golf Course can be played as a
nine-hole regulation course or as an 18-hole course using a Cayman
ball. A Cayman ball is designed to travel half as far as a regular
golf ball. The Brittania course is the Caribbean's only course
designed by Jack Nicklaus. Call 345-949-8020.
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon is the island's second nine-hole course. Designed
by Greg Norman, the private course will be for guests of the
Ritz-Carlton resort, expected to open in mid-2001.

<P>
   H _ HELL, IT'S HERE
</P>
<P>
   Some tourist traps pretend to be paradise. This place is Hell.
Yes, that's the official name of a pit stop on van tours. A
devilish rock formation is the reason some guidebooks recommend a
visit, but it's actually nothing more than a collection of T-shirt
shops brimming with postcards.
</P>
<P>
   And what's this?
</P>
<P>
   A post office in Hell.
</P>
<P>
   How convenient.

<P>
   I _ INTERNATIONAL BANKING CENTER
</P>
<P>
   London, Tokyo and New York have long been known as banking
capitals. But did you know Grand Cayman ranks fifth in size among
international financial centers? That's thanks to the country's
tax-free policies and 1960s-era legislation that approved banking
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Today 550 banks, more than 400 insurance companies and nearly
900 regulated mutual funds are among the 31,000 registered
companies doing business in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why business suits outnumber swimsuits in George
Town.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   J _ JUST LOOKING
</P>
<P>
   Duty-free shopping is appealing, but you should know going in
that the Caymans are expensive when compared to other islands.
</P>
<P>
   The country's strong economy and the Cayman Islands dollar's
fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar (CI $1 equals U.S. $1.25)
mean you won't find the bargains of, say, the Bahamas or Mexico.
What you will find are some choice goods at a choice price. So be
choosy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider jewelry featuring Caymanite, a unique-looking
semiprecious stone found only in the Cayman Islands. The Cayman
Islands National Museum has a nice, well-priced selection.
</P>
<P>
   Seek out locally produced treasures such as folk art, thatch
brooms and waurie boards, which are used in a West Indies game
similar to backgammon. Another popular purchase is jewelry made
with antique coins and other items recovered from shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's way off the beaten path, don't miss Caribbean
Charlie. This wonderful shop on the north side of Grand Cayman
sells whimsical hand-carved birdhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Charlie Ebanks, the birdhouses pay tribute to local
landmarks. The creations are painted by Ebanks' wife, Elaine. Her
palette is vivid and reflects the islands: Pink is for the conch,
green for the sea, blue for the sky, and yellow for the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Ebankses add another birdhouse to their
repertoire. Charlie also creates custom tables, beds, chairs and
other furnishings. Call 345-947-9452.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware as you shop that some items for sale won't make it past
U.S. customs. Any goods made from turtles (including shells, food
products and jewelry) are banned.
</P>
<P>
   And before buying black coral, make sure the seller is licensed
to harvest it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   K _ KAYAKING AND OTHER ADVENTURES
</P>
<P>
   Activities on Grand Cayman are not limited to snorkeling and
diving. Kayaking, water-skiing, parasailing and windsurfing are
among recreational possibilities. Other options include horseback
riding, golf, tennis, hiking and bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
   Your hotel's concierge or tour desk can suggest places to rent
gear and hire guides. And if you tire of fun in the sun, the
Stingray Bowling Centre &AMP; Arcade offers indoor distractions. Call
345-945-4444.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   L _ LOADS OF LODGING
</P>
<P>
   Island accommodations run the gamut from four-diamond luxury
digs to self-service condominiums. But budget-minded travelers will
be hard pressed to find lodgings for less than $100. Even a
normally bargain-priced chain such as Sleep Inn charges rates
starting in the off-season at $120 for a double. The Cayman tourism
office has an extensive lodging guide that lists rates.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing rates, be sure to inquire about added taxes and
surcharges. A government tax adds 10 percent to all room rates, and
most hotels add a 10 percent to 15 percent gratuity.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to films such as ``The Firm,'' the Hyatt Regency is the
hotel that comes to mind when most people think of Grand Cayman.
You'll need a map to find your way around the sprawling Hyatt
resort, which boasts five restaurants, a fitness center and spa,
several boutiques, a dive shop and an extensive children's program.
Call 345-949-1234 or access www.hyatt.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another highly regarded Seven Mile Beach hotel is the Westin
Casuarina Resort. The hotel is noted for its beach-front location,
friendly staff, full-service spa and Casa Havana, a Cuban-flavored,
open-air restaurant. Call 345-945-3800; access www.westin.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a more intimate experience, consider Annie's B&AMP;B,
one of a handful of guest houses on Grand Cayman. Annie Moulton's
place is in the Snug Harbor neighborhood, a few blocks from Seven
Mile Beach. It provides guests with a full breakfast, towels and
folding chairs for beach outings, and use of a washer and dryer.
Its spotless rooms have private baths, and two sitting rooms are
available for guests' use. Call 345-945-5505; access
www.anniesplace.ky.

<P>
   All-inclusives are just beginning to gain momentum on Grand
Cayman. Two sister properties are the Beach Club on Seven Mile
Beach and Spanish Bay Reef at the island's northwestern tip. The
resorts' packages include lodging, all meals and beverages
(including alcohol), use of snorkeling and diving equipment,
introductory diving and snorkeling lessons, unlimited daytime shore
diving for certified divers, use of nonmotorized sport equipment
and airport transportation. Call 800-482-3483; access

   M _ MASTIC TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   The island's natural wonders aren't limited to the water. The
Mastic Trail takes adventurous visitors into a dense forest and
through a mangrove swamp that recalls a time before tourists and
mass logging. Along the two-mile trail, you are likely to see
parrots, frogs, lizards and the West Indian woodpecker, as well as
mango, papaya and royal palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   You can hike the trail on your own, but you'll get a better
understanding of local flora and fauna by taking a guided tour.
Silver Thatch Excursions, founded by biologist Geddes Hislop,
offers a three-hour tour for $50; participants should be reasonably
fit and wear sturdy walking shoes.
</P>

   N _ NATIONAL MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman Islands National Museum focuses on the islands'
residents and their seafaring tradition. One exhibit introduces the
``catboat,'' a vessel that was painted blue to allow anglers to
sneak up, catlike, on turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in the Old Courts Building, the museum pays tribute to
``founder'' Ira Thompson, a cabdriver who began gathering Caymanian
artifacts as a hobby in the 1930s. The Cayman government bought his
collection in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $5, $2.50 for children. The museum is closed on
Sundays. Call 345-949-8368.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O _ OUT AND ABOUT
</P>
<P>
   You'll find plenty of variety in the local dining scene, where
menus offer everything from burgers to racks of lamb. Indulge in
the local cuisine, but be prepared for sticker shock: With the
exchange rate, the $12 entree really costs $15, and most
restaurants add a gratuity to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of our favorite restaurants:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lighthouse at Breakers is a 25-minute drive down the
southern coast from George Town. The atmosphere is far more casual
than the fare, which includes Chicken &AMP; Shrimp Stir Fry, Lobster
Gnocchi and Lobster Quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   The charming ocean-side restaurant earns kudos for its
vegetarian selections and freshly baked bread and is widely known
for its extensive wine selection.
</P>
<P>
   It's open daily. Call 345-947-2047.
</P>
<P>
   _ While fresh seafood specialties such as Lobster Bisque and
Basil and Pistachio Crusted Sea Bass are tempting, we have to
wonder whether it isn't the floor show that keeps the Wharf packed.
Floor show is a misnomer; this is a sea show. In the evening, huge
tarpons begin circling the outdoor dining area, which juts over the
ocean. They come to be fed, and their feeding is the show.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant employee throws out freshly cut fish, and the
tarpons react with lightning-quick speed. The Wharf also allows
young diners to feed the tarpons.
</P>
<P>
   It's open for dinner daily. Call 345-949-2231.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey Bogart rules the roost at the romantic Ristorante
Pappagallo. Bogart is an African gray parrot who greets diners at
the door; he is joined by a feathered menagerie that includes
colorful macaws and comical cockatoos.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a natural lagoon and topped with a dramatic thatched
roof, the restaurant is stunning. Its menu focuses on northern
Italian specialties and fresh seafood, and its wine list is
extensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's open daily. Call 345-949-1119.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   P _ PEDRO ST. JAMES CASTLE
</P>
<P>
   Another misnomer, Pedro St. James is not a castle. Built in 1780
as a private home, it is the country's oldest stone building. On
Dec. 5, 1831, Caymanian democracy was born when a group meeting
here decided to form the islands' first elected parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can explore the three-story coral-stone house, which
has wide verandas, mahogany floors and a first-floor jail. A
well-done multimedia production shares 200 years of history in 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time on the Pedro St. James ocean-front grounds,
landscaped with native cacti and trees. Purple bougainvillea and
yellow allemanda offer tropical splashes of color.
</P>
<P>
   It's open daily. Admission is $8, $4 for children. Call
345-947-3329.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q _ QUEEN ELIZABETH II BOTANIC PARK
</P>
<P>
   We discovered the beauty of the traditional Caymanian sand yard
during a visit to this spectacular 65-acre nature preserve. The
park features several habitats, including a Floral Colour Garden, a
woodland trail and a wetland area that attracts many bird species.
</P>
<P>
   The sand yard's collection of conch shells, vines and palms
creates fantastic shadows that rival any showy blooms. It fronts a
colorful and carefully restored Caymanian house, focal point of the
park's Heritage Garden, which explores island life through displays
of fruit trees and medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
   Another park highlight is its iguana habitat, which showcases
the endangered blue iguana. Although the iguana looks scary, the
park's most threatening inhabitants are a trio of poisonous plants
that visitors would be wise to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The park is open daily. Admission is $7.50, $5 for children.
Call 345-947-9462.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R _ RUM CAKES
</P>
<P>
   You can almost wring liquid from these super-moist cakes, which
are made with specially blended Tortuga Rum. At the ``factory'' and
a satellite mini-bakery, picture windows allow visitors to watch as
the batter is poured into tiny bundt pans. Skip that and head for
the free samples.
</P>
<P>
   Here and at a dozen other Tortuga Rum Co. stores, you'll find
several flavors of Cayman Island Rum Cake, the island's
biggest-selling export. Besides the original-, chocolate- and
coffee-flavored cakes, Tortuga Rum also produces truffles,
rum-flavored coffees, fudge and barbecue sauce.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get to Grand Cayman soon, go online to order a rum
cake at www.caribplace.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   S _ STINGRAY BEER
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Cayman Islands' first micro-brewery provides a
quick lesson in beer production. Watch as brewers add a bit of
barley, a dose of wheat, a dash of hops and a hint of yeast to
water to produce a heady beer. Stingray is served in many
restaurants and bars. The brewery is closed on Sundays. Call
345-947-6699.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   T _ TURTLE FARMING
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned Cayman Turtle Farm is the only one of its
kind in the world. Started in 1968, the farm is home to 18,500
green sea turtles, the largest weighing more than 600 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to producing turtle meat, a staple of the Caymanian
diet, the farm releases 25 percent of its hatchlings to the wild.
It also is involved in research and conservation, working with
other countries to protect endangered turtles such as the Kemp's
ridley.
</P>
<P>
   The farm's collection of native wildlife includes Cayman green
parrots, iguanas, agoutis and hickatees.
</P>
<P>
   The farm is open daily. Admission is $6, $3 for children. Call
345-949-3893; access www.turtle.ky.

   U _ UNDERSEA TOURS
</P>
<P>
   Don't dive or snorkel? That doesn't mean you have to miss the
underwater wonders of Grand Cayman. Three companies offer views of
marine life that aren't all wet.
</P>
<P>
   The Nautilus is the world's largest semi-submersible and the
latest arrival on the undersea-tour scene. Its design allows for
above-water viewing on deck and underwater discovery in a spacious
cabin six feet below the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   Nautilus offers several types of excursions, ranging from a
one-hour tour to a dinner cruise. It also hosts a weekly comedy
show featuring the island's Big Kahuna. Call 345-945-1355.
</P>
<P>
   _ A similar experience is provided by the Seaworld Explorer,
which has an underwater observatory and a covered deck and offers
one-hour tours. Call 345-949-8534.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlantis Submarines operates a 48-passenger submarine that
takes tourists to depths of 100 feet. Night dives focus on corals,
sponges and other nocturnal marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis offers a terrific experience, but some passengers may
be uncomfortable with the tight quarters. Children must be at least
3 feet tall to be allowed on the sub. The company also has a
three-person submarine that takes guests to depths of 1,000 feet.

   V _ VISIT CAYMAN BRAC AND LITTLE CAYMAN
</P>
<P>
   These two islands _ separated by just five miles, but 90 miles
from Grand Cayman _ appeal to travelers looking for a peaceful
playground.
</P>
<P>
   Like Grand Cayman, they beckon to divers. Just off the north
coast of Cayman Brac, you can explore the cannons, missile launcher
and decks of a sunken 330-foot Russian frigate. Little Cayman
boasts the Bloody Bay Wall, a 1,200-foot vertical wall that teems
with marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Cayman Brac should not miss its parrot reserve,
which opened in 1996. Brimming with silver thatch palms, cacti,
wild banana orchids and agaves, the park is home to about 400
parrots.
</P>
<P>
   Island Air offers daily flights between Grand Cayman and its
sister islands. Call 345-949-5252.

<P>
   X _ X MARKS THE SITE OF PIRATES' PLUNDER
</P>
<P>
   During the 1700s, the islands were known as a pirates' paradise
because of their remoteness. Grand Cayman celebrates its
swashbuckling history with the annual Pirates Week National
Festival, a raucous 10-day extravaganza that includes parades,
street dances, heritage festivities and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too early to begin planning for next year's festival,
Oct. 27-Nov. 5. For information, write to Pirates Week National
Festival, Box 51 GT, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, British West
Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Other annual events on Grand Cayman include the Orchid Show
(345-947-9462) in February; Cayfest 2000 (345-949-5477) in April;
International Aviation Week (800-346-3313) in June; and Taste of
Cayman (345-949-8522) in July.

</P>
<P>
   Y _ YIELD TO CRUISERS
</P>
<P>
   While the Cayman Islands limit the number of cruise-ship
passengers to 6,000 per day, George Town can get a little crowded
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Just avoid downtown during
midmorning and late afternoon, when the day-trippers are in
transit.
</P>

   Among cruise lines calling regularly on Grand Cayman are
Carnival, Celebrity, Crystal, Holland American, Norwegian, Premier,
Princess and Royal Caribbean.

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not in the least superstitious, but I know enough not to
open an umbrella indoors, leave shoes on a table or a hat on a bed,
touch somebody with a broom or rock an empty rocking chair. When
any of these sure-fire invitations to misfortune occur, I _ like
anyone who hears a sneeze _ say, ``Bless you!'' The latest medieval
research tells us that this phrase _ in German,  &UR; Gesundheit &LR; , ``a
state of good health'' _ keeps the Devil from possessing your soul.
</P>
<P>
   But folklorists know there are more specific expressions that
are used to ward off evil in special situations. At a gathering of
media biggies, I posed this query to Corinne Boggs Roberts: When
you are walking along hand in hand with a friend, and an obstacle
like a tree or a lamppost forces you to break your handclasp
momentarily, what expression do you use to ward off a quarrel or,
worse, permanent separation? Without hesitation, Cokie, as she is
known to intimates, replied, `` &UR; Bread and butter &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bartis, at the American Folklife Center of the Library of
Congress, explains, `` &UR; Bread and butter &LR;  go together, a sign of
unity.'' He finds a citation in the seven-volume Frank C. Brown
Collection of North Carolina Folklore: ``If two persons are walking
and they come to an object (high object) in their path, and one
goes on one side and one on the opposite side, they will have a
fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   A California source shows the expression to be national: ``When
something goes between two people while walking, and nothing is
said afterward, the two will quarrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of bytes of e-mailed expostulations will be onloaded
to my head from folklorists certain that the only expression to be
used in that case is  &UR; needles and pins &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Hold your ire. According to a 1920s usage cited in the
Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE), when two people
accidentally said the same thing in unison, ``one would then say
`needles' and the other `pins,' then hook little fingers and make a
silent wish.'' (I used to say ``Snap!'' before hooking pinkies.
Today I say, ``Great minds think alike,'' and eschew the digital
signals.) ``When walkers were separated and did not use this phrase
or  &UR; bread and butter &LR; ,'' DARE adds, ``it was believed they would
have a quarrel.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDS WITH
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. John Kerry has an affinity for the vice president's
positions,'' writes Carey Goldberg in The New York Times, ``and is
friends with him.''
</P>
<P>
   That locution grates on the ears of Kenneth Smith of Newark,
Del. ``Since we have never met,'' he writes, ``it follows that I am
not  &UR; friends with &LR;  you.'' He finds his singular  &UR; I &LR;  ill fits the
plural  &UR; friends &LR;  and prefers to put that as the all-plural ``we are
not friends'' or the all-singular ``you are not a friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   I checked with the usagist Jacques Barzun, who is a friend. He
is untroubled by the number disagreement of this spreading idiom
but finds a shade of difference in meaning: `` &UR; Friend of &LR;  refers to
an established relationship.  &UR; Friends with &LR;  gives the connotation
of `friendly toward,' referring to the attitude rather than the
firm relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the element of abstraction.  &UR; Friends with &LR;  is an
outgrowth of  &UR; friendly with &LR; , implying interaction between people.
You can be a  &UR; friend of &LR;  the Constitution or a  &UR; friend to &LR;  man, but
you cannot be  &UR; friends with &LR;  either abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm  &UR; friends with &LR;  her,'' in my book, is not incorrect, but is
informal. ``We're friends'' or ``she's a  &UR; friend of &LR;  mine'' is
unassailable in any company.
</P>
<P>
   REVELATION DISCLOSURE
</P>
<P>
   In a reminiscence of the late Judith Campbell Exner, a put-upon
paramour of President Kennedy, I wrote that ``responsible
newspapers subsequently revealed that ((Sam)) Giancana, the woman's
Chicago lover, was also the Mafia don who took a contract from the
CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   A careful reader questions my use of the verb  &UR; reveal &LR; . Wouldn't
a better choice have been  &UR; disclose &LR;  or  &UR; divulge &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   The root of  &UR; reveal &LR;  is the Latin  &UR; velum &LR; , ``veil''; to  &UR; reveal &LR; 
is to strip away the veil. The early use of  &UR; revelation &LR;  had to do
with the unfolding of divine will or the making-known by some
supernatural agency. That meaning still clings to the central sense
of the word today; to  &UR; reveal &LR;  is to allow a vision of what is
beyond the range of ordinary human reason or sight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disclose &LR;  is its workaday synonym; no heavenly choir is singing
in the background. The root meaning is ``to unclose,'' which means
``to open''; the most common sense is ``to make known what was
previously unpublished, deliberately held back or kept secret.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Divulge &LR;  can be tracked back to the Latin  &UR; vulgus &LR; , ``mob''; it
means ``to make known to the multitude,'' with the whiff of a
suggestion that the informant should have kept his information to
himself. It implies either a breach of confidence or other
impropriety in the communication. (I like Merriam-Webster's New
Dictionary of Synonyms, but will not  &UR; divulge &LR;  my source.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a writer (called `contributing editor') on Time
magazine,'' notes Allan Ecker of New York, ``the managing editor
was T.S. Mathews, a brilliant man. He always struck out  &UR; revealed &LR; 
(`The sergeant  &UR; revealed &LR;  that no gun had been found on the scene')
and substituted  &UR; disclosed &LR;  or just plain  &UR; said &LR; . According to
Mathews,  &UR; revealed &LR;  was `reserved for the five books of Moses and
the poetry of William Blake.'''
</P>
<P>
   I'll go with that. Not every full disclosure is a full
revelation.

HOW A HARDWORKING MAN LEARNED _ THE HARD WAY _ TO PUT HIS HEALTH
FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after my chest was split open for heart bypass surgery, I
think I understand a little how women must feel after a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning when I take a shower, I see my reflection in the
bathroom mirror. My eyes invariably lock onto the thick, wrinkly
scar that runs from just below my throat to a spot 2 inches above
my navel. Bypass scarring is minimal compared with the loss of a
breast, but it's still my body I see in the mirror, damaged and
different and never to be the same again. I swallow hard; I guess I
will for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of heart surgery is as traumatic as heart illness
itself, maybe more so. The emotional distress before the operation
is different from adjusting to a new lifestyle with physical
limitations afterward. Heart disease can take us by surprise,
especially when we don't know how to recognize the warning signs
or, worse, ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to me should interest you if you are making the
same mistakes or care about someone who is. The consequences can be
awful.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAKING OF A WORKAHOLIC
</P>
<P>
   Compulsive overachievers like me are usually born not quite as
good-looking, intelligent, coordinated or glib as some of our
peers. As children in the 1950s to mid-'60s, we were raised to
believe that, despite our limitations, anything was possible if we
worked as hard as we could. Talent could be secondary to
determination. Parents and teachers repeated the message, and we
believed it.
</P>
<P>
   For us, ``no excuses'' became a philosophy, not a brand of
jeans. Co-workers who called in sick handed us the advantage
genetics hadn't. Self-esteem was measured by how much physical
and/or emotional pain we ignored while we worked harder than the
next guy, which is why some of us die or come close to it when
we're in our late 40s and early 50s.
</P>
<P>
   In my first 16 years at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, I believe
I missed four scheduled workdays, two when relatives died. I always
arrived around 7 a.m. so I could get in an extra few hours' work
before the office phones started ringing. At night, I wrote books
at home, six between 1992 and 1998. I averaged three speeches a
month, to church or civic groups. I also tried not to neglect my
family, which meant I often did my writing between 10 p.m. and 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With so much time devoted to work, there wasn't enough for
regular exercise. Maybe two Saturday mornings a month, I played
tennis with a friend. Otherwise, my main physical exertion was
opening the refrigerator. I was addicted to unhealthy food _
barbecue and enchiladas, ice cream, pastry and mashed potatoes
swimming in gravy and dotted with thick hunks of butter.
</P>
<P>
   I believed that I deserved those treats because I worked so
hard. My weight increased, from 200 pounds to 220, then 230,
finally reaching a point at which I avoided scales.
</P>
<P>
   Middle age only increased my frantic pace. Journalism is a
profession in which, in the words of the late, great writer Jerry
Flemmons, ``The young eat the old.'' In my early years at the
Star-Telegram, I'd gleefully shouldered older writers aside. Now I
was obsessed with not letting that happen to me. I began
volunteering to write stories no one else on the staff would dare
to do, such as living on the streets of Fort Worth for a week as a
homeless person. My objective was to give readers an insight into
social problems that needed to be addressed. But it was also
self-serving; I was hopeful that Star-Telegram management would
consider me irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   I was 46 years old when I spent a week on the streets in 1997.
At the end of that week, my feet were sore (I walked an average of
18 miles a day); I lost 17 pounds (weight I quickly regained); and
had a dislocated shoulder suffered in an attack by a drug addict
outside a homeless shelter. Because my wife had ordered me not to
go _ Nora predicted I would get hurt during the course of the week
_ I never told her about the injury, and wrote around the incident
in the Star-Telegram story.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder popped back into place, but there was muscle damage
that a doctor told me required surgery. I just ignored the pain
instead, and it prevented me from playing tennis. I became a total
couch potato.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1998, I could play tennis again. But now, there
was a new problem. During my matches, I felt pressure against the
base of my throat, like someone pushing a thumb against my
windpipe. I could still breathe and wasn't feeling faint, but the
sensation was constant and annoying. Occasionally, I noticed the
same pressure when I wasn't exercising.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEN, AGONY
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Nov. 21, 1998, I went out to play tennis
with my friend. As we began knocking balls around the court, I felt
the pressure on my throat, and this time it was so intense, it made
me dizzy. I said I didn't feel good, and that we'd have to quit.
Inside, I fumed. Enough was enough. I was going to get in shape!
</P>
<P>
   But I had already run out of time.
</P>
<P>
   I got up at 6 a.m. Sunday. Too heavy to jog comfortably, I
decided to walk two or three brisk miles. I was quiet leaving the
house, so I wouldn't wake my wife.
</P>
<P>
   The throat pressure was there from my first step. I kept going,
but about three-quarters of a mile from my house, I was brought to
my knees by a sudden, searing pain that erupted behind my left
shoulder blade. It was agony like I'd never felt before. I thought
I was dying.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't black out, although I came close. The pain didn't go
away, but it diminished. It was still dark; nobody else was around.
I staggered to my feet. Step by step, stopping every time the
pressure in my throat increased, I lurched home and collapsed on
the porch.

PERSONAL HEALTH: WHAT WOMEN CAN DO TO TAKE THE STING OUT OF HOT
FLASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot flashes are a staple of menopause jokes, but there is
nothing funny about them, and certainly nothing imaginary. They are
experienced by at least 75 percent of American women at some point
in menopause, including just before and just after. (They can also
be brought on by the popular breast cancer drug tamoxifen and by
the bone-building drug raloxifene.) They can vary from occasionally
annoying to life-disrupting, and they can last for as little as a
few days or as long as 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes are especially disruptive for women awakened
repeatedly with night sweats, leaving them unable to get restful
sleep. A desire to suppress hot flashes is the main reason women
start hormone replacement therapy; estrogen in appropriate doses
can eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
   But there are millions of menopausal women who cannot or will
not take estrogen. Many have had breast cancer or know they are at
high risk for developing this disease, and because breast cancer
cells are stimulated by estrogen, these women and their doctors are
reluctant to risk it. Other women experience unpleasant side
effects from hormone replacement or are simply uncomfortable with
the idea of dosing their bodies with hormones that nature has
turned off. For such women, there are a number of simple, safe ways
to reduce _ and sometimes even eliminate _ hot flashes without
having to take hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes occur because the brain decides that the body is
overheated. It sends out signals that dilate outer blood vessels
and induce sweating, which results in heat loss. Skin temperature
may rise as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit. To a bed partner, a woman
having a night sweat may feel like a radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a hot flash is felt most intensely in the upper body,
especially in the face, neck and back. A woman may experience a
feeling of intense heat for a minute or more or, in more severe
cases, she may become very flushed and dripping wet. Her heart may
beat faster, she may experience palpitations and, in rare cases,
she may faint. Hot flashes may occur a few times a day or six or
more times an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what some people think, susceptibility to hot
flashes is unrelated to a woman's emotional, mental or physical
well-being, although these factors may aggravate the problem. Nor
are flashes the sole result of estrogen deficiency, since there are
many women equally estrogen-deficient who get few or no hot
flashes. Studies by Dr. Robert Freedman and colleagues at the Wayne
State University School of Medicine in Detroit suggest that women
with and without hot flashes are distinguished by differences in
their body's thermostat, which is controlled by the central
sympathetic nervous system in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In women with hot flashes, Freedman found, the central
sympathetic nervous system is more active and, as a result, the
brakes on the body's heat dissipation response fail to work
properly. He noted that the drug clonidine, which suppresses
central sympathetic nervous system activity, reduces hot flashes,
whereas the herb yohimbine, which stimulates this system, provokes
hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Freedman's studies found that in menopausal women
without hot flashes, as well as in younger women, there is a range
of body temperatures _ a neutral zone of about 0.4 degree Celsius,
or 0.7 Fahrenheit _ within which they neither sweat nor shiver. But
in women with hot flashes, there is no such range. Thus, the
slightest rise in body temperature _ as little as 0.1 Celsius,
which may occur, say, after drinking a hot cup of coffee or eating
a big meal _ can provoke a hot flash as the body tries to lower its
internal temperature. And if the hot flash drops the body
temperature too much, these women then shiver.
</P>
<P>
   Keep a diary for a few days, recording the time and
circumstances surrounding each flash. Every woman is different, and
what provokes a hot flash in one may not do so in another. Still,
the following measures are effective in reducing the frequency and
intensity of hot flashes in many women:
</P>
<P>
   DIET _ Limit or avoid caffeine (in coffee, tea, soft drinks and
chocolate), alcohol, spicy foods, very sugary or salty foods, hot
liquids and very large meals. Add soy-based foods to your diet;
they contain weak plant estrogens, which may be helpful in
reasonable amounts (one or two servings a day) and are not harmful
to a woman who has had breast cancer. Ground flaxseed is also a
good source of plant estrogens; it can be added to cereal, muffin
mixes and bread dough.
</P>
<P>
   CLOTHING _ Avoid synthetic fabrics that do not breathe, like
polyester and nylon, especially in blouses and dresses. Stick to
natural fibers: cotton, rayon and silk. Make sure bedsheets are 100
percent cotton and blankets are a natural fabric as well. Avoid
turtlenecks and long sleeves (except in an outer garment you can
remove). Learn to dress in layers so you can easily take garments
off and put them on again as your body temperature shifts.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING _ Don't. Nicotine constricts blood vessels, which can
intensify and prolong a hot flash.
</P>
<P>
   EXERCISE _ Although intense exercise can cause a rise in body
temperature that may provoke a hot flash, over all, women who are
physically active tend to have fewer and less intense hot flashes,
perhaps because their bodies become more tolerant of temperature
extremes and more effective at cooling down.
</P>
<P>
   ROOM TEMPERATURE _ The warmer the room, the more hot flashes you
are likely to have. Lower the thermostat at home to less than 70
degrees during the day and 65 degrees at night. Sleep with a window
open even in winter, and in hot weather, use a fan or air
conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   COOLING DEVICES _ Keep a thermos of ice-cold water nearby at all
times, and take a cold drink as soon as you feel a flash coming on.
Carry a battery-operated fan that will fit in your purse, or use a
paper folding fan to cool yourself down.
</P>
<P>
   RELAX AND VISUALIZE _ Stress is a common inducer of hot flashes.
That's why women sometimes become drenched in sweat while making a
business presentation or speech. Practice meditation techniques to
calm yourself and keep you from overreacting to stressful
situations. As you feel a hot flash coming on, imagine yourself in
a cool or cold situation or picture the heat escaping through your
hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW, DEEP BREATHING _ In studies supported by the National
Institute on Aging, Dr. Freedman has shown that hot flashes can be
cut in half by consciously reducing breaths to six or seven a
minute, letting the abdomen rather than the chest expand with each
inhalation. Practice the slow-breathing technique for 15 to 20
minutes twice a day and use it when you feel a hot flash coming on.
</P>
<P>
   HERBS AND VITAMINS _ Anecdotal reports attest to the ability of
vitamin E, at doses of about 800 international units a day, to
reduce hot flashes. B vitamins and vitamin C may also be helpful.
Claims about herbs are based mainly on small, poorly controlled
studies and sometimes simply on folklore. One exception may be
black cohosh, which German tests have found effective and which is
now being tested in a well-designed study at New York Presbyterian
Hospital. Although it has estrogenlike effects, it does not raise
blood levels of estrogen, according to the lead researcher, Dr.
Victor R. Grann, an oncologist.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS _ Two are effective: megestrol acetate (Megace) and
clonidine (Catapres). Megace is a synthetic progesterone used to
treat breast cancer; possible side effects include weight gain and
menstrual bleeding. Catapres, which lowers blood pressure, reduces
the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and cuts hot flashes
by about 50 percent. Possible side effects include drowsiness and
dizziness if blood pressure falls too low. It is best taken orally
at bedtime.

<P>
   &UR; A Pesticide Filter &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A car's air filter is a simple device, usually just a ring of
paper through which all of the air entering the engine must pass.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Ohio State University have studied what amounts to
a similar filter for farmland. But it is one that treats exiting,
not entering, air, and is made not of paper but of evergreen trees.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied how effective rows of evergreens were in
reducing the movement of pesticides beyond fields where they were
sprayed. Using droplets of dye in wind tunnel experiments, they
found that pine trees and other evergreens collected two to four
times more droplets than deciduous trees like maples.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen needles, the researchers noted, have more surface area
than flat leaves, and create swirling air patterns that lead to
more droplets' being deposited. (Evergreens have another advantage
as well; they never lose all their needles.)
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who plan to build a longer wind tunnel for more
studies, suggest that windbreaks made of evergreens could be useful
in limiting the drift of pesticides off agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Is Anyone Out There? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that if aliens were to somehow pick up the
jumble of radio and television signals that emanate from Earth,
they would learn much about civilization. But they might get the
wrong idea _ that all humans sound like Rush Limbaugh, say, or look
like Fred and Ethel Mertz.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago this month, scientists sent a deliberate
and much more powerful message, aimed at a specific location in the
sky. It wasn't nearly as funny as an ``I Love Lucy'' rerun, but
after all, it was meant to inform aliens, not entertain them.
</P>
<P>
   The three-minute message, which was sent from the Arecibo radio
telescope in Puerto Rico on the occasion of a ceremony marking a
major upgrade to the instrument, included in simple binary form the
formula for DNA, a diagram of the solar system, a human stick
figure and other information. It was aimed at a cluster of about
300,000 stars near the edge of the Milky Way, more than 20,000
light-years from Earth. The idea was that any civilization with an
Arecibo-size dish or better should be able to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the signal still has a way to go. And even when it
gets to that part of the galaxy in 200 centuries, the cluster will
have moved. The transmission was more a demonstration of the power
of the telescope and less a serious effort to communicate with
other worlds. But that did not stop many scientists from leaving
the tent at the ceremony and gazing up at the telescope as the
message left Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Good Show &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid meteor shower last week lived up to expectations,
with some observers reporting peak rates that exceeded the
predicted range of 1,000 to 1,500 meteors per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The show was particularly impressive in parts of the Middle East
and southern Europe, where rates of 1,600 to 1,800 meteors per hour
were reported early Thursday morning. In North America, the highest
counts were 40 to 50 meteors an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some predictions as to when the peak would occur were highly
accurate, including those by astronomers at Armagh Observatory in
Northern Ireland.

MEDICINE AND MARKETING, OPEN DOORS TO MEDITATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By LESLIE BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As her meditation session drew to a close, Mary Bryant found it
difficult to get up from her chair. Not only was it hard to break
the calming spell cast by her instructor, but Ms. Bryant was still
stiff from running the New York City Marathon and pushing, for the
whole 26 miles, a flower-strewed wheelchair dedicated to a late
friend and fellow breast cancer patient.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the tall, slender Ms. Bryant summoned her resolve and
managed to stand while repeating her teacher's suggested thought,
``I am here now.'' She added her own twist, ``I am here now, and I
am cancer free.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a fitting mantra for the inaugural meditation class at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's new integrative medicine
service in Manhattan, where patients can also get massages,
acupuncture, nutritional advice and a crack at playing Tibetan
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   With its muted earth tones, river rock fountain and artfully
lighted shelves of crystals, the center, which opened on Nov. 1,
more closely resembles a spa in Big Sur than part of a huge
Manhattan hospital. Yet it is the latest example of a national
trend in which conventional medical institutions are embracing
healing methods once dismissed as alternative medicine and
combining them with standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Meditation, the discipline of directed attention that began in
India about 2,500 years ago, is among the most popular techniques
now going mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not invasive, it has no side effects, it has tremendous
benefits that are very well documented and it's something patients
can do on their own so it doesn't cost anything,'' said Dr. Barrie
R. Casselith, chief of the new program, who holds a doctorate in
medical sociology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cancer treatment,'' Dr. Casselith quickly added.
``It deals with quality of life and helps with symptoms. It can
relieve pain, lower blood pressure and heart rate. It can make
people feel calmer, it enhances mood. It does lots of good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her counterpart at Beth Israel Medical Center, Dr. Woodson
Merrell, called meditation ``perhaps the most powerful tool for
health.'' Merrell is executive director of Beth Israel's planned
Center for Health and Healing, to open in April.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress gave the National Institutes of Health $10
million a year for five years to expand a network of mind-body
research centers and provide training for health workers in a
variety of meditative approaches. One of the most popular
techniques used, though there are scores of styles, is a form
called mindfulness meditation, in which the patient learns to be
aware of sensations and thoughts and temporarily tune out everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot keep up with the demand of health professionals to
learn this,'' said Dr. Herbert Benson, the cardiologist who coined
the term ``relaxation response'' and founded the Mind/Body Medical
Institute at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who helped popularize meditative techniques, whether
they consist of prayer, exercise or more traditional Eastern
meditation skills, first documented the physiological benefits of
the techniques and their effect on stress nearly 30 years ago.
Since then, he said, his findings have been repeatedly affirmed,
most recently in a study presented in October at the annual meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   During the study, conducted by a team of Harvard researchers,
five people who have been meditating daily for at least five years
were placed inside a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, or MRI.
During a 42-minute period they were asked to stare at a dot on a
screen, randomly to generate a mental list of animals, and to
meditate. The resulting pictures of their brains showed that the
regions that process emotion and influence cardiorespiratory
function were most active during meditation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, said Dr. Sara Lazar, an author of the study,
they verify ``what meditators have been saying all along: that they
feel calmer and that meditating brings about specific, quantifiable
changes in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, skeptics view the current romance with meditation as
inspired by money as much as by open-mindedness. ``It's good
marketing,'' said Dr. Richard Sloan, a psychologist and director of
behavioral medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
``There's no doubt the relaxation response has an impact on the
autonomic nervous system, but there's a question whether that
translates into a health benefit or whether it's just ephemeral.''

<P>
   The Rev. Larry VandeCreek, director of pastoral research for the
HealthCare Chaplaincy, cited a 1993 study published in The New
England Journal of Medicine that found the general public was
spending huge amounts of money on alternative medicine. ``There's
certainly some cynicism here, trying to capture or recapture a
piece of the market,'' VandeCreek said. ``But I think there may
also be some sincere attempt to do what's best for the patient, and
if some of these interventions are helpful, then they ought to be
used.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether meditation is offered as a purely secular relaxation
technique or a more spiritual exercise also remains a sensitive
subject. At Columbia-Presbyterian's Center for Meditation and
Healing, in Manhattan, Dr. Joseph J. Loizzo, a psychiatrist, begins
classes with the ritual ringing of silver Tibetan bells and
recently led one pair of advanced students in a discussion of Tara,
the Buddhist goddess of compassion. Tuition for an eight-week
course is $950.
</P>
<P>
   A practicing Buddhist and firm believer in the power of
meditation to overcome depression and mood disorders, Loizzo
nonetheless prescribes antidepressants when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me the first time I met him, `Are you spiritual?'''
said a former patient who now studies with Loizzo once a week and
meditates twice a day. The 41-year-old schoolteacher, who asked not
to be named, had been hospitalized for depression and began
meditating to wean herself from the drug Effexor. ``I used to feel
that depression was always out there and that I was one of the
people it could get,'' the woman said. ``Now I understand you can
heal from within, that we have a lot of resources we can use.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sloan-Kettering, where administrators carefully discuss
meditation in strictly nonreligious terms, Barbara Parisi, a
patient, began meditating to stave off anxiety but said her daily
practice had since gained a spiritual side.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parisi, 50, who has lung cancer and meditates during her
weekly chemotherapy sessions, likes to picture herself in her
garden or floating among stars and clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's godlike, it's love, it's connection to other human
beings and life,'' she said. ``You feel so vibrant and so full and
so good. It makes me feel that even if I don't win this battle, it
will be all right because there's a sense of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryant, a fashion model in her 30s who had a mastectomy and
chemotherapy in the last year and is going through follow-up tests,
talks about meditation in more practical terms. ``The uncertainty
is terrifying,'' she said. ``We have the strength inside to handle
it, but you have to clear your head to find the strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan-Kettering spent $500,000 to renovate what had been a
prostate cancer clinic, adding a small studio for meditating, yoga
and exercise. Patients pay $80 for each hour they spend there.
Insurance coverage varies greatly; some companies pay for some
services, but Medicare does not. ``It's evolving, and some
insurance companies are more accepting of it than others,'' said
Simone Zappa, the program director of the Integrative Medicine
Service.
</P>
<P>
   During its first meditation class, Dr. David Payne, a
psychologist, led Ms. Bryant and two other women in an hourlong
mental body scan in which they focused on their sensations from
head to toe and were urged to ``bring a sense of honor and
respect'' to their bodies. All three women were smiling broadly and
sitting as still as statues by the end of the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe I'm cancer free,'' Ms. Bryant said. ``But I feel
it's important to stay strong to keep my immune system strong to
help fight the disease.''

<P>
   The roar of the crowd, the crack of the bat _ and that
unpleasant little squirt of tobacco juice many batters like to let
loose just before they step into the box. It just wouldn't be
baseball without them.
</P>
<P>
   But, hard as it may be for baseball fans to believe, chewing
tobacco, or consuming nicotine in any form, may make it harder for
people to perform complex tasks involving hand-eye coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco-chewers proved slower at learning and adjusting to
changing visual patterns on a computer screen. They also exhibited
slower, jerkier movements and were less accurate over all than
non-users, reports a study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco this
month.
</P>
<P>
   It is intriguing, said Jose Contreras-Vidal, the lead author of
the article, that so many tobacco-chewing batters can perform a
feat far beyond the ability of most other people, tobacco-using or
not. Batters routinely hit balls streaking in at more than 90 mph
on any one of a number of trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the explanation may lie in the overall consistency
of what batters see when they step into the box, however varied the
pitches. But he also wondered whether refraining from tobacco could
still make a difference. ``Maybe they could be even better,'' said
Contreras-Vidal, of the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects were asked to draw the straightest path from a central
point on a computer screen to changing targets. No differences were
seen in a first round of tests between tobacco-chewers who had
abstained for at least eight hours and non-users. But after the
test was changed, and some participants were allowed to chew
tobacco, they were found to perform significantly less accurately.
Their problems continued even when they repeated the first test.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REMEDIES: Taking Vitamin E, for Better or for Worse &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin E supplements are among the most popular
over-the-counter remedies, taken in the belief that they may help
with everything from dry skin to the effects of aging. But not all
vitamin E is created equal. A new study raises questions about how
useful the vitamin can be in helping people with crippling
arthritis of the knee and also offers evidence that some forms of
it may actually worsen osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   In a study presented last week to a meeting in Boston of the
American College of Rheumatology, researchers focused on a
component of vitamin E called gamma tocopherol, which is
increasingly being found in preparations of vitamin E, along with
alpha tocopherol, the most common ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joanne Jordan, an arthritis specialist at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who presented the findings, said
much more study is needed. But she added, ``Based on the results of
our study, we would suggest that you take the alpha tocopherol and
stay away from the gamma tocopherol.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research had suggested that a higher amount of vitamin E
in the diet might help slow the progression of arthritis in the
knee. But that study did not include blacks, Dr. Jordan said, and
it gauged vitamin E intake by asking people what they ate rather
than by drawing blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   The new study of 400 people was evenly divided between blacks
and whites with arthritis. Researchers studied X-rays of the
subjects' knees and tried to correlate the degree of their disease
with the components of vitamin E in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK: Stress of War Might Cause Heart Disease &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The war never seems to end for some combat veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of evidence has indicated that veterans who
suffer post-traumatic stress disorder are at risk for a variety of
health problems, from infections to digestive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study adds weight to the theory that the veterans may
be more likely candidates for coronary heart disease. The research,
in a report in the current Annals of Behavioral Medicine, suggests
that the stress disorder and other kinds of severe psychological
stress may actually cause heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The research was part of a series of studies done by Joseph
Boscarino, a Vietnam veteran and epidemiologist. Now in private
industry, Boscarino did the studies at Catholic Health Initiatives,
a health network in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is confirmed, then doctors need to consider this as a
risk factor'' for heart disease, Boscarino said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers based their conclusions on data from a large-scale
study done for the National Institutes of Health in 1986 and 1987.
More than 4,000 Vietnam combat veterans were examined to determine
the health effects of their experiences an average of 17 years
after they had fought.
</P>
<P>
   Although earlier studies using information from those
examinations also theorized a higher risk of heart disease for
veterans with stress disorders, Boscarino said the new one was more
definitive because it looked at electrocardiogram data from the
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Those data showed abnormal results in 28 percent of the veterans
with stress disorder, 24 percent of those with depression and 22
percent of those with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NUTRITION: Newest Superfruit: The Pomegranate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Make way for the latest entrant to the pantheon of fruits and
vegetables that may fight disease: the pomegranate.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, a
major research center in Haifa, have issued two new studies
suggesting that components of the fruit could be effective in
fighting disease and slowing aging. The studies found evidence that
pomegranates contain high levels of chemicals that may help combat
cancer and hardening of the arteries, and slow the aging process at
the cellular level. (One study was reported in the July issue of
The Journal of Ethnopharmacology; the other has been accepted for
publication next month, according to officials affiliated with the
institute.)
</P>
<P>
   The researchers chose the pomegranate for study because it has a
long history of use as a folk medicine in the Middle East, Iran and
India. They found that flavonoids, antioxidants that are believed
to have a beneficial effect, exist in higher concentration in
pomegranate wine than in wine made from grapes. They also found
high concentrations in pomegranate oil and juice.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists cautioned, however, that more study needed to be
done to prove that there were health benefits, and that people
would have to eat the fruit regularly and over a long period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have AIDS, or the infection that causes it,
information can be the most important weapon of all.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has become easier to get. A new Web site offers doctors
and patients a wealth of information, regularly updated, about
various HIV therapies that are approved or are still in the
experimental stages.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site should improve access to what has long been a
valuable resource for fighting the disease: the HIV/AIDS Treatment
Directory, published since 1985 by the American Foundation for AIDS
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site (www.amfar.org/td/) offers users the ability to
search a database of clinical studies of experimental therapies,
which may be especially useful for patients who are not responding
to conventional treatments. People using the Web site can
anonymously enter information about where they live and the
specifics of their conditions, like their blood counts. They will
then be told which programs may be the most appropriate. The site
also contains links to published studies. Unlike the print version
of the directory, which was updated twice a year, the Internet one
will be changed continually. But the print directory will still be
published and be available free to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is a nonprofit group that says it has spent more
than $161 million to fight AIDS, mostly by helping to finance
almost 1,800 research teams.

 DAM-LADN  
Unnatural wonder, Hoover Dam, which energized Las Vegas _ literally
_ ranks as a construction marvel of the 20th century  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By Eric Noland 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
BOULDER CITY, Nev. _ Taming the natural world.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was practically a compulsion of man at the start of this
century. A canal was carved through the then mosquito-infested
swamps at the Isthmus of Panama and completed in 1914. The Holland
Tunnel, more than 1 1/2 miles in length, was burrowed beneath New
York's Hudson River in 1927. The Empire State Building climbed to
an unthinkable height of 102 stories in that city four years later.
Two bridge projects were begun across belligerent San Francisco Bay
in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   But the feat widely regarded as the most remarkable of that era
is Hoover Dam, a wedge of concrete jammed into the Colorado River
over a Godforsaken canyon on the Nevada-Arizona border. Even now,
more than a half-century after its completion, it remains an object
of fascination, attracting more than a million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   They peer over the 726-foot face of the dam or take a tour
through the bowels of the power plant, where water is forced
through steel pipes as wide as 13 feet in diameter and 560-ton
rotors turn in gargantuan generators.
</P>
<P>
   If they linger long enough to hear the human stories behind its
construction, visitors learn that Hoover Dam is more than an
impressive feat of engineering. It is an enduring tribute to the
individual workers who labored through backbreaking tasks in
torturous conditions to get it built. Most had little alternative;
the Depression directly coincided with the dam project, and anyone
who griped or faltered could be (and often was) replaced in a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what had to be accomplished with 1930s technology: In
often-searing desert heat, four diversion tunnels, 56 feet in
diameter and averaging more than 4,000 feet in length, were hacked
and blasted through the rock walls of the canyon. Dump trucks
poured hundreds of loads of rocks into the Colorado River to create
a temporary dam and force the river into the tunnels. The riverbed
was scooped out, down to bedrock some 75 feet below. Finally,
concrete was poured into a maze of wood forms _ tons of concrete,
enough to build a two-lane road from Los Angeles to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The dam, a National Historic Landmark administered by the U.S.
Department of the Interior, is an easy excursion for visitors to
Las Vegas _ it's a 31-mile drive southeast via U.S. 93. Hoover Dam
is a worthy diversion if only because it was solely responsible for
putting the glitter in the gulch.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas was nothing more than a dusty, bawdy frontier town of
5,000 when the dam contract was awarded. It quickly swelled with
laborers and their families, and later embraced workers seeking
unrestrained recreation. When the dam was completed and the power
switches flipped on, there was ample juice for the neon that would
follow.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive visitors center was erected at Hoover Dam four
years ago, complete with a new, roomy elevator that descends 50
stories through the canyon wall to the power plant. A hard-hat tour
was added a year later, supplementing a standard tour that has been
popular for years.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute standard tour, which costs $8 for adults, leads
visitors _ in groups of up to 60 _ to the power plant at the base
of the dam, onto a balcony that overlooks the eight generators on
the Nevada side of the plant, out onto a ramp that provides a view
up the mammoth face of the dam, and into a tunnel where a viewing
platform takes in one of the enormous penstock pipes through which
water is fed to the generators from Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
   For $25, the hour-long hard-hat tour is limited to 16 or so
visitors and navigates the warren of tunnels and walkways deep in
the dam's heart. (You get to keep the hat.) Unless you're an
engineering buff or profoundly curious about this operation, you
can probably dispense with this tour; you'll find the standard tour
to be perfectly adequate. Dam officials also advise people who
suffer from claustrophobia to steer away from the hard-hat tour.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, the hard-hat excursion was conducted by Bruce
Laughlin, a brusque, burly sort who wears aviator sunglasses
indoors and whose protective headgear is a hard-plastic cowboy hat.
At several stops, he held forth on the intricacies of hydroelectric
power generation, and while a few in the group seemed to grasp the
concepts, the rest of us were content simply to gaze around. (Gee,
that's a really big bolt.)
</P>
<P>
   The tour also provided perhaps the tiniest inkling of what the
working environment might have been like. Black Canyon was chosen
as the site of the dam because at that point the Colorado cut
through a narrow cleft in the rocks. Today, at the base of the dam,
the dark, rocky walls rise steeply on both sides, blotting out any
shred of a breeze and funneling the oppressive desert sunlight onto
this spot as if with a magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   Just walking across the outdoor ramp causes beads of sweat to
sprout beneath the free hats. Now imagine what it would be like to
wield a jackhammer or shovel in these conditions for eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin was not without a sense of humor. At one point, he led
the group through a pipelike air shaft near the top of the dam. One
by one, we approached a metal grate and took in a dizzying view of
the Colorado River far below. ``Try not to lean on the grate,'' the
guide said from the darkness behind us. ``We don't know if it's on
real tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Several tidbits of information were dispensed. On this blowtorch
of a day in early September, we were told, demand for power would
run high when Southern California's air conditioners started coming
on in the early afternoon. ``We'll be running all 17 generators at
full power later today,'' Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked of the El Nino year of 1983, when the Colorado
River was swollen ominously by runoff from the Rocky Mountains. The
waters of Lake Mead rose to within seven feet of the top of the
dam, and the spillway had to be activated. (Farther upriver, Glen
Canyon Dam's diversion tunnel linings were severely damaged, but
Hoover Dam's half-century-old construction barely flinched.)
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin also addressed the two most-asked questions by visitors
to Hoover Dam: How many people died building it, and how many
workers are entombed in it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the latter query is none. The dam was built in a
series of interlocking blocks and columns _ if a continuous pour of
concrete had been used, the core would have risen in temperature as
it was hardening, and the concrete would have taken 125 years to
cool. Thus, when a load of concrete was dumped into each form, it
spread out and was never deeper than six inches.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say there was not a burial fatality, though.
According to Joseph E. Stevens' excellent book, ``Hoover Dam: An
American Adventure,'' (University of Oklahoma Press; $17.95), a
wooden form gave way during one pour and a worker was swept off a
scaffold in an avalanche of wet concrete. His dead body was dug out
16 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of fatalities in Hoover Dam's construction is a
subject of debate. One popular item of lore records the first death
as J.G. Tierney, a Bureau of Reclamation employee who fell from a
barge and drowned in the Colorado River during a geological survey
of prospective dam sites in 1922. It records the last victim _ No.
112 _ as Patrick Tierney, an electrician's helper who fell from one
of the intake towers back of the dam in 1935. Patrick was J.G.'s
son.
</P>
<P>
   But this coincidence is almost too convenient _ to make it work,
you have to ignore a death on an earlier survey mission.
</P>
<P>
   A more reliable figure is 96 _ the recorded number of industrial
fatalities on the construction job itself. Most were the result of
falls, according to Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder there aren't more today, with the top of the dam
crawling with tourists on a daily basis. If you suffer from
acrophobia, a look over the 4-foot wall at the top of the dam's
face will turn your knees to gelatin. The words ``Please Keep Off
Wall'' are stenciled into the concrete at regular intervals, which
can mean only one thing: People have been known to climb up there
to pose for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, out of the heat, the Hoover Dam visitors center provides
numerous opportunities to learn about not only the engineering
particulars but also of the human stories of the construction. (For
those who opt not to take tours, admission to the visitors center
alone is $4 for adults.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features here is tucked away in a theater on the
exhibit level. It is a 60-minute documentary film created by the
Public Broadcasting System as part of its ``The American
Experience'' series. Every visitor should block out an hour to
watch this in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   The film includes priceless black-and-white footage of the dam's
construction, plus a glimpse at the plight of family members who
lived out of cars, in cardboard hovels at a riverside camp called
Ragtown, and later in the sterility of the company town that was
built for the workers, Boulder City.
</P>
<P>
   There are also present-day interviews with men who worked on the
dam. One such fellow says grimly, ``There were three shifts a day,
every day, with two days off a year _ the Fourth of July and
Christmas . . . optional.''
</P>
<P>
   For the consortium of six contractors that was entrusted with
building the dam, the timing of the project couldn't have been any
better. The federal government authorized the project exactly 17
months after the stock market crash of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before ``safety net'' referred to social policy,
people were desperate for work. They descended on this barren
corner of the Mojave Desert by the hundreds, and created a vast
waiting list at the dam's hiring office. Six Companies, led by
superintendent of construction Frank T. Crowe, exploited this
buyer's market odiously.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, there were deaths by heat prostration because water
wasn't made available at remote reaches of the job site, even at
times when temperatures climbed into the 130s. (One unconscious man
transported to a Las Vegas hospital registered a temperature of 112
degrees.)
</P>
<P>
   During the excavation of the diversion tunnels, men suffered
acute carbon monoxide poisoning because Crowe insisted on using
gasoline-powered trucks to haul out the rubble, in open defiance of
Nevada mining law. Six Companies faced stiff federal fines for
missing various construction-phase deadlines, and Crowe _ who
earned the nickname ``Hurry Up'' among the workers _ was loath to
endure the delay (much less the expense) that would be required to
convert the trucks to electric motors.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors maintained a hospital in Boulder City, but the
Hippocratic oath took a severe beating there. Men stricken with gas
poisoning were routinely diagnosed as having pneumonia or
influenza, even when they died of it. Stevens reported in his book
that near the completion of the dam, when one worker died after
suffering a head injury in a fall, the cause of death was listed as
spinal meningitis _ a non-job-related malady, and thus not subject
to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the project, a brief, ill-fated strike was waged. It's
reported that most of the workers relented simply out of hunger _
Six Companies provided a free mess hall for men on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ``Hurry Up'' Crowe brought the job in early _
more than two years ahead of schedule. And Hoover Dam, which threw
an immobilizing harness over the Colorado River, was to have an
immediate and profound impact on the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Valley, which had suffered through disastrous
floods early in the century _ including one that formed the Salton
Sea _ blossomed as a newly fertile agricultural area. Los Angeles,
a small town with a perpetual thirst, grew in direct proportion to
the water and power it received, first as a military aircraft
production site during World War II, later as a thriving aerospace
center.
</P>
<P>
   And Las Vegas . . . well, in the town that moderation forgot,
growth was accelerated on two prongs: the legalization of gambling
in Nevada in 1931 and the gusher of electricity that began to flow
out of the dam's power plant five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hoover Dam has numerous cousins along the Colorado (Glen
Canyon, Parker, Davis dams), and Los Angeles and Las Vegas have
nearly outgrown it. Hard-hat tour guide Laughlin noted that while
56 percent of Hoover Dam's power goes to Southern California, that
represents only about 1 percent of what the region uses. And the
dam accounts for only about 4 percent of the power that Las Vegas
requires.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the remainder come from? Coal-fired and nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   It all began here, though.
</P>
<P>
   It began soon after then-Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes
stood up at the dam's dedication ceremony and said, ``Pridefully,
man acclaims his conquest of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this century, it was an important boast.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Hoover Dam is a 31-mile drive southeast of the
Las Vegas Strip, requiring 45 minutes in moderate traffic. From the
Strip, head east on any of the major thoroughfares (Tropicana,
Flamingo, Desert Inn, etc.) to U.S. 93/95 and go south. When the
highway splits, follow U.S. 93 to Boulder City. Once in Boulder
City, signs to the dam will try to direct you on a crawl through
the town's business district. To avoid this, turn left at Buchanan
Boulevard _ which doubles as U.S. 93 Truck Route _ and proceed to
the dam.
</P>
<P>
   HOURS: The visitors center is open from 8 a.m. until 5:45 p.m.,
with the last tour conducted at 5:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: Admission to the visitors center for those electing not
to take a tour is $4 for adults, $2 for kids ages 6 to 9. The
half-hour standard tour is $8 for adults ages 17 to 61, $7 for
seniors age 62 and up, $2 for kids ages 6 to 16. The hour-long
hard-hat tour costs $25. Parking in the dam's multiple structure is
$2.

HOW A HARDWORKING MAN LEARNED _ THE HARD WAY _ TO PUT HIS HEALTH
FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after my chest was split open for heart bypass surgery, I
think I understand a little how women must feel after a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning when I take a shower, I see my reflection in the
bathroom mirror. My eyes invariably lock onto the thick, wrinkly
scar that runs from just below my throat to a spot 2 inches above
my navel. Bypass scarring is minimal compared with the loss of a
breast, but it's still my body I see in the mirror, damaged and
different and never to be the same again. I swallow hard; I guess I
will for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of heart surgery is as traumatic as heart illness
itself, maybe more so. The emotional distress before the operation
is different from adjusting to a new lifestyle with physical
limitations afterward. Heart disease can take us by surprise,
especially when we don't know how to recognize the warning signs
or, worse, ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to me should interest you if you are making the
same mistakes or care about someone who is. The consequences can be
awful.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAKING OF A WORKAHOLIC
</P>
<P>
   Compulsive overachievers like me are usually born not quite as
good-looking, intelligent, coordinated or glib as some of our
peers. As children in the 1950s to mid-'60s, we were raised to
believe that, despite our limitations, anything was possible if we
worked as hard as we could. Talent could be secondary to
determination. Parents and teachers repeated the message, and we
believed it.
</P>
<P>
   For us, ``no excuses'' became a philosophy, not a brand of
jeans. Co-workers who called in sick handed us the advantage
genetics hadn't. Self-esteem was measured by how much physical
and/or emotional pain we ignored while we worked harder than the
next guy, which is why some of us die or come close to it when
we're in our late 40s and early 50s.
</P>
<P>
   In my first 16 years at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, I believe
I missed four scheduled workdays, two when relatives died. I always
arrived around 7 a.m. so I could get in an extra few hours' work
before the office phones started ringing. At night, I wrote books
at home, six between 1992 and 1998. I averaged three speeches a
month, to church or civic groups. I also tried not to neglect my
family, which meant I often did my writing between 10 p.m. and 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With so much time devoted to work, there wasn't enough for
regular exercise. Maybe two Saturday mornings a month, I played
tennis with a friend. Otherwise, my main physical exertion was
opening the refrigerator. I was addicted to unhealthy food _
barbecue and enchiladas, ice cream, pastry and mashed potatoes
swimming in gravy and dotted with thick hunks of butter.
</P>
<P>
   I believed that I deserved those treats because I worked so
hard. My weight increased, from 200 pounds to 220, then 230,
finally reaching a point at which I avoided scales.
</P>
<P>
   Middle age only increased my frantic pace. Journalism is a
profession in which, in the words of the late, great writer Jerry
Flemmons, ``The young eat the old.'' In my early years at the
Star-Telegram, I'd gleefully shouldered older writers aside. Now I
was obsessed with not letting that happen to me. I began
volunteering to write stories no one else on the staff would dare
to do, such as living on the streets of Fort Worth for a week as a
homeless person. My objective was to give readers an insight into
social problems that needed to be addressed. But it was also
self-serving; I was hopeful that Star-Telegram management would
consider me irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   I was 46 years old when I spent a week on the streets in 1997.
At the end of that week, my feet were sore (I walked an average of
18 miles a day); I lost 17 pounds (weight I quickly regained); and
had a dislocated shoulder suffered in an attack by a drug addict
outside a homeless shelter. Because my wife had ordered me not to
go _ Nora predicted I would get hurt during the course of the week
_ I never told her about the injury, and wrote around the incident
in the Star-Telegram story.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder popped back into place, but there was muscle damage
that a doctor told me required surgery. I just ignored the pain
instead, and it prevented me from playing tennis. I became a total
couch potato.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1998, I could play tennis again. But now, there
was a new problem. During my matches, I felt pressure against the
base of my throat, like someone pushing a thumb against my
windpipe. I could still breathe and wasn't feeling faint, but the
sensation was constant and annoying. Occasionally, I noticed the
same pressure when I wasn't exercising.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEN, AGONY
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Nov. 21, 1998, I went out to play tennis
with my friend. As we began knocking balls around the court, I felt
the pressure on my throat, and this time it was so intense, it made
me dizzy. I said I didn't feel good, and that we'd have to quit.
Inside, I fumed. Enough was enough. I was going to get in shape!
</P>
<P>
   But I had already run out of time.
</P>
<P>
   I got up at 6 a.m. Sunday. Too heavy to jog comfortably, I
decided to walk two or three brisk miles. I was quiet leaving the
house, so I wouldn't wake my wife.
</P>
<P>
   The throat pressure was there from my first step. I kept going,
but about three-quarters of a mile from my house, I was brought to
my knees by a sudden, searing pain that erupted behind my left
shoulder blade. It was agony like I'd never felt before. I thought
I was dying.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't black out, although I came close. The pain didn't go
away, but it diminished. It was still dark; nobody else was around.
I staggered to my feet. Step by step, stopping every time the
pressure in my throat increased, I lurched home and collapsed on
the porch.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   I went inside. Nora and the boys were still in bed. The pain was
now a dull ache. I decided not to tell my family what had happened.
They'd only worry, and I was convinced I hadn't had a heart attack,
because the pain wasn't in my chest.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I saw my doctor. I told him what happened _ sort
of. I'd been walking, had a little discomfort, decided to come
home. He examined me, told me to lose weight, gave me an
electrocardiogram, and suggested that, just to be on the safe side,
I should see a cardiologist. He made an appointment for me for that
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he sent the results of the electrocardiogram to the
cardiologist's office. The cardiologist's nurse called me to say I
had to come in now.
</P>
<P>
   The cardiologist was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either had a heart attack or tried hard to have one,'' he
said. ``We've got to do tests right away to see how much (coronary)
blockage there is. Then we'll either do an angiogram or a bypass,
depending what we find.'' For every day I put off surgery, he
added, odds dramatically increased that I'd have a fatal heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like I'd been dropped down a well. I heard a voice I
barely recognized as my own, asking if there was a way I could have
the surgery without my family knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   He said no.
</P>
<P>
   ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Nov. 30, 1998, I had triple bypass surgery at Harris
Methodist Fort Worth hospital. I was told I'd have to stay home for
a month, then gradually build to a full day back at work. My diet
would now be sensible, with vegetables replacing grease. I would
exercise regularly, with ``regularly'' defined as ``every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, I would have to change my attitude. That sounded
like the hard part. It was and still is.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy food took some adjusting to, but now it tastes pretty
good. Since my surgery, I have not eaten barbecue or a steak or ice
cream or a doughnut. Not once.
</P>
<P>
   My tennis-playing is still sporadic, but I exercise a minimum of
four hours a week, mostly half-hour daily walks. I've figured out a
hilly three-mile route around my neighborhood, and so far have worn
out a pair of cross-trainers. Sometimes I jog part or most of the
way. I let my body dictate the pace. But I walk when it's cold,
very hot or raining. I often walk right after I get home from work,
to alleviate job-related stress.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep habits are different, too. I try to get seven hours a
night, and I go to bed whenever I feel tired. If that's
occasionally before 10 p.m., so what?
</P>
<P>
   At work, I'm trying to be more sensible. I still get in around 7
a.m., and get a lot of the day's writing done before the phones
start ringing. But I go home by 4 p.m. whenever possible. As books
editor, I can take reading home with me. Ten hours of work a day is
about my limit. When I start feeling tired, I quit whatever I'm
doing. I wonder whether I used to get just as tired and simply
ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   After his bypass, author Larry McMurtry wrote eloquently about
his belief that whoever he was died on the operating table, leaving
a shell behind, a new, although somehow lesser, person. I don't
think anything quite that dramatic happened with me, but I know
what he means. The differences manifest themselves in little
things, like having to remember to button my shirts all the way up
to the collar so the top of my scar doesn't peep out. But I've also
changed in other, more significant ways.
</P>
<P>
   Having come close to dying, I am obsessed for the first time
with not having THAT happen again for as long as possible. I
hesitate now when I never would have before. By coincidence, I was
in Oklahoma City the afternoon those terrible tornadoes struck, but
instead of racing into the middle of the chaos so I could write an
on-the-scene story, I stayed in my motel room.
</P>
<P>
   Recuperation itself has become uncertain. Although I have lost
about 30 pounds, 25 of them disappeared within a couple months of
giving up barbecued brisket. It's frustrating how little weight
I've lost since. I ought to be as skinny as Calista Flockhart (Ally
McBeal) by now. I'm told I have to try harder.
</P>
<P>
   I've had to go through some medication changes, and, in one
case, it wasn't easy. Just after I got back from Oklahoma City, my
cardiologist put me on a new drug he warned might take me a few
weeks to get used to. In fact, I spent almost a month in a haze. At
one point, I couldn't remember which of my two sons was older. But
because the doctor said they would be better for me, I didn't tell
him or my editors about the side effects, and, finally, the side
effects went away.
</P>
<P>
   But the uncertainty hasn't. You never stop being afraid it's
going to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   I might be sitting in front of my computer, hiking up a hill
near TCU, or driving to the grocery store. I feel the tiniest
twinge anywhere in my body above the waist, and I think I'm having
a heart attack. After a moment or two I know that isn't true, that
I'm being stupid. But the next time, I panic again. I guess it's
fair to say I'm always a little afraid now, and that mental scar is
worse than the surgical one down my chest. For me, as for many
other coronary patients, this is the legacy of pushing too hard and
eating too much and exercising too little. All we can do now is try
to minimize the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand me. I'm happy and grateful to still be
alive. I should be around to see my sons finish growing up. I have
every intention of not just seeing my grandchildren someday, but
attending their weddings. But the days in between will have
difficult moments. I brought them on myself.
</P>
<P>
   If you've long been promising to take better care of yourself,
start now. Just imagine seeing your own scarred chest every morning
in the bathroom mirror. Be smarter than I was. You don't want to
learn the hard way.

FEWER POLLUTION PENALTIES COLLECTED IN TEXAS UNDER BUSH WATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when Texas is gaining notoriety for
leading the nation in toxic emissions, state regulators are
collecting fewer and fewer environmental fines, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Fines collected from polluters during fiscal 1999 have hit a
seven-year low, figures from the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission show.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists say the downward trend reflects lax
enforcement by the administration of Gov. George W. Bush and a
disturbing coziness with the industries that the commission
regulates, an allegation that state officials dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in penalties comes as an increasingly harsh spotlight
focuses attention on the state's environmental problems. As
Dallas-Fort Worth struggles to meet federal air standards and
Austin edges closer to violating them, Houston recently passed Los
Angeles as the smog capital of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some things that otherwise might have been caught
by inspectors going unpenalized,'' said Ken Kramer, director of the
Texas branch of the Sierra Club, a national environmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said Bush's ``whole approach to regulation has been
primarily one of laissez faire, in which business and industry is
allowed to call the shots. In that type of atmosphere, there's not
going to be any tough enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides and commission officials see the enforcement trend
differently. For one thing, the commission _ controlled by Bush
appointees _ says the number of enforcement actions being taken to
court has risen, so getting a final resolution has taken longer in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, orders requiring companies to take some type of
corrective action dramatically increased during the past 10 years _
from a little over 200 in 1990 to more than 600 in 1999 _ even
though penalties have gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said an ``all-time record high''
of about $27 million in fines was levied in 1998. That figure
included court-imposed fines generated by legal action taken by the
Texas attorney general's office in addition to fines imposed by the
natural resource commission. She was unable to provide a breakdown
of how much was assessed by the commission or generated by legal
action, although she said most of the fines were the result of
action by the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enforcement of environmental protection has been strong during
Governor Bush's tenure,'' she said, pointing to the spike in
enforcement orders issued by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say one reason that penalties have dropped is that the
agency has gotten better at catching violations early, in part
through voluntary programs, thus avoiding the necessity of
assessing penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are addressing violations earlier in the process,
and as a result you are having fewer penalty events,'' said Paul
Sarahan, the commission's director of litigation. ``People are
getting into compliance sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   According to agency figures, the total amount of fines collected
in fiscal 1999 (which ended Aug. 31) was $4 million. The most
recent year in which regulators collected a lower amount was 1992,
when $3.5 million in penalties was collected, figures show.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with $4.6 million in 1998, $4.1 million in 1997
and $6.9 million in 1996. The highest penalty level in the past 10
years occurred in 1993, when $9.1 million was collected.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from fines, the commission also requires companies under
enforcement orders to engage in ``supplemental environmental
projects,'' in which companies agree to fund local ecological
improvements in lieu of penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, more than $4 million in such projects were
required, meaning that, when combined with penalties, companies
were required to spend more than $11 million to comply with
enforcement orders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even after adding in the amounts for supplemental
projects, the total dollar amount that companies were required to
spend as a result of enforcement activity is at a seven-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a Democratic presidential candidate and
possible Bush rival for the White House, has repeatedly hammered
Texas for its environmental problems, recently noting that the
state was ``No. 1 in the pollution of water, air and ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures that Gore is using come from the Toxic Release
Inventory compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The
data show that Texas led the nation in 1997 in total toxic
emissions, which include releases on land and in the air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has led the nation in toxic air releases since 1988,
according to Ramon Alvarez, staff scientist at the Environmental
Defense Fund in Austin, which has analyzed the EPA data.
</P>
<P>
   In total releases of all toxic emissions, Texas has had the
worst record in the nation since 1994, with Louisiana close behind,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and state officials say one factor driving the
downturn in penalties is a controversial state program that
encourages voluntary compliance with environmental laws:
self-audits.
</P>
<P>
   By conducting internal audits, companies can confidentially
divulge violations and receive immunity from penalties.
Participation in the program has steadily grown since it was
introduced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 260 notices that violations _ and multiple
violations _ have been discovered during self-audits since the
program began in 1995, commission figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were unable to say how many violations have been
discovered altogether, although former commission Chairman Barry
McBee testified before Congress in 1997 that there were, on
average, 4.3 violations per disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   If that rate held constant, that would mean that about 1,000
violations have been disclosed to the commission under the
self-audit program.
</P>
<P>
   Although companies can still receive penalties even after
disclosing violations if the infraction involves willful
noncompliance, the commission's audit coordinator, Scottie Aplin,
said she knew of no such penalties ever being imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to avoid or prevent them from getting
penalties,'' she said. ``The idea is to get them into their
facilities and getting them into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists criticize the law because the detailed
information about the violations is kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has come to accept it as their right to know what
violations of environmental laws have happened in their
communities,'' said Robin Schneider, director of Public Research
Works, a Texas environmental group. ``You're going to see a lot
fewer violations being punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that watchdog groups cite in explaining the
penalty downturn is a relatively new policy, drafted in 1995,
against unannounced inspections. Environmentalists say the policy
allows polluters to cover up dirty practices before the inspectors
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators dispute that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard practice is to announce the inspection, to give
notice,'' said Sarahan, the commission's litigation chief. ``The
exception is where we have a complaint or where there is a belief
that giving notice would allow time for the violations to be
covered up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarahan said notifying the companies ahead of time allows for
``both an effective and an efficient inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not alone in experiencing a decline in assessing
penalties for environmental violations.
</P>
<P>
   A story in the November issue of Washington Monthly documents an
enforcement decline on the federal level and in most states.
Although most enforcement activity occurs at the state level, the
article called the EPA ``remarkably lax in its oversight role.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston environmental lawyer Jim Blackburn said there has been a
decline in enforcement statewide for years, a factor he attributes
to the notion that regulated industries should be treated like
``clients'' of the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a little more distance, a little more of the old-time
regulator,'' Blackburn said. ``I'm just a pretty firm believer in
that if someone is not in compliance with the law, it ought to be
flagged and they ought to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn said the cooperative trend ``was well under way'' when
Bush took office in 1995, but worsened since. He said the
Legislature has not been very friendly to the environment, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, it is hard to get a strong environmental agency,
whether's it's Democrat or Republican,'' Blackburn said. ``I think
it's worse under Bush ... but I think the Texas Legislature is a
huge problem.''

BONFIRE TOLL ADDS TO PALL OVER A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ All too regularly this year, volleys of
gunfire have rung out over the Texas A&AMP;M campus, blacked out and
eerily silent during the salutes to the recent dead.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the stately Academic Building, where a bronze
statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross, a Texas governor and A&AMP;M
president, watches over the lawn, buglers sound taps. The doleful
refrain is repeated for each A&AMP;M student who died during the
previous four weeks. This year, it has become painfully familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Death has come calling here often of late, too often for a
campus crowded with teen-agers and 20-somethings. The extraordinary
number of deaths _ by car wreck, suicide, drug overdose, homicide,
plane crash _ had already taken a toll on the Aggie family before
Thursday's collapse of a huge log pyramid being erected for the
annual bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   But the deaths of 12 more young people celebrating a beloved
ritual the week before Thanksgiving compounded an already growing
sense of melancholy at this university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could happen this year? What else could go wrong?''
asked Travis Rubelee, a senior in the Corps of Cadets, whose face
registered a tired resignation that, indeed, very little else could
go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This is a university that takes death very seriously. There are
solemn ceremonies, such as Silver Taps and Muster, and buildings
where hats are removed in honor of A&AMP;M's war dead, and a graveyard
and eternal flame honoring the succession of mascots named
Reveille.
</P>
<P>
   But this reverence is not just part of A&AMP;M. It is embedded into
the culture of Bryan-College Station and the twin cities'
population of about 123,000, and even some of the area's smaller
towns, such as Hearne, where businesses and schools lowered their
flags to half-staff last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of people over the last two days who feel
the same way I do,'' said Hugh Walker, an assistant city manager in
Bryan. ``They say, `I didn't go to A&AMP;M. I've got no ties to A&AMP;M. I
don't know anybody at A&AMP;M. But this hurts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M University is a big place, with more than 40,000
students, almost all of them young, some of them from places hours
away by car, some of them overtired, some of them who drink.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them die every semester. But 12 in the spring? And 19
so far this fall?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of students have talked again and again about what a bad
semester this has been,'' said Sean Miller, a 1998 graduate who
works at the Association of Former Students. ``When we lose one or
two, it hurts. But this year has been extremely difficult to deal
with. It's certainly tested our faith. And a lot of us just want
this one to be over with.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's student newspaper, ``The Battalion,'' ran a news story
Nov. 4, two weeks before the bonfire accident, about the rising
death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Four students died in auto accidents during a three-week period
in late February and March.
</P>
<P>
   A student overdosed on cocaine in March.
</P>
<P>
   A freshman leaped to his death in March from a campus parking
garage in the middle of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Also in March, a 21-year-old woman who was taking a semester off
from A&AMP;M was found bludgeoned to death in Brazos County.
</P>
<P>
   In April, an A&AMP;M student was killed in an accident on Interstate
30 in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   A plane, owned by Ags Over Texas, carrying five skydivers from
A&AMP;M, crashed in September after taking off from a Bryan airfield,
killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   An A&AMP;M freshman fell asleep at the wheel of his car and plowed
into a crowd outside a fraternity party in October, killing six
students, one of them from A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any of these incidents, it has amazed me how many
students are impacted,'' the paper quoted the student counseling
director as saying. ``It is almost like dropping a stone and the
concentric circles going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Silver Taps, which seldom attracted more than a
couple of hundred students, has been going up too. The next one,
Dec. 7, right before finals, may set a record when taps is played
12 times.
</P>
<P>
   Taken individually as deaths, though, a number of students and
professors said they could rationalize this year, as bad as it has
been. Car accidents happen all the time. Skydivers take risks. Drug
and alcohol abuse leads to bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been the case since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unthinkable happened,'' said Drunay Collins, a junior from
San Antonio. ``It was like Bryan-College Station had an earthquake.
That's how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, and friend Donna Trevino, also a junior, said the
bonfire deaths struck the campus so much harder because they
happened on campus, because the victims died during construction of
the bonfire, because the hearses sat parked on the polo fields all
day for everyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects everyone who goes to school here,'' Trevino said.
``It's been very hard to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the university hasn't tried. Classes went on as
scheduled, the administration believing that the students might be
better off distracted with math and science.
</P>
<P>
   But a great many of the professors postponed tests or just gave
``walks.'' A few classes prayed together, some just talked about
their feelings. Texas A&AMP;M has never been quieter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My math prof is an adviser to the Corps and she came into
class (Friday) and just lost it,'' Trevino said. ``She's a pretty
cocky kind of math prof, so it was difficult for all of us to see
that. This just isn't going to go away for us.''

   Bryan-College Station is unquestionably a college town. Although
the two cities have their own personalities and have been known to
compete with each other, they're forever linked, really, as one
place. The unifying element is A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``No A&AMP;M, no Bryan-College Station,'' explained Don Ganter,
owner of the area's legendary watering hole, the Dixie Chicken.
``Without that university, there wouldn't be enough people around
here for a volunteer fire department.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganter figures that 95 percent of the people in Bryan-College
Station are economically tied to A&AMP;M, but probably more than that
are emotionally tied to it.
</P>
<P>
   College Station has the newer homes, most of the students, a
majority of the professors. Bryan is older, less expensive, more
working class. Around them are rural towns like Calvert and Iola
and Wellborn.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mayfield, director of the Baptist Student Ministry and a
resident of the area for only about three years, said the mixture
revolves around A&AMP;M's students, transient as they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a noon Bible study every week and the local churches
bring food for the students to eat,'' Mayfield said. ``But you know
who brings most of the food? It's the churches in Navasota and
Roans Prairie and Madisonville, none of whom really have a personal
tie to A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strange, and really strong, friendship and bond
between the local folks and the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That bond is seen in the flags at banks, hotels, car
dealerships, fast food joints all flying at half-staff. It is seen
in the words of encouragement on signs along the street, and in the
eyes of an Asian convenience store clerk who apologized for crying
in front of a customer. ``It's the bonfire,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freshmen in school for two weeks come by here to make sure
they get their senior boots from us,'' said Kathi Holick,
granddaughter of the Czech cobbler who built a boot business on A&AMP;M
cadets. A few minutes after she said it, two underclassmen came in,
just to sit there quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to know them over the years,'' she said, biting her
lip. ``It's been a very weird two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Don Self, a 20-year-old from Arlington killed in the
bonfire accident, was supposed to pick up his senior boots in a few
days. Tim Kerlee Jr., a freshman who died late Friday, asked to
hold a pair of senior boots before he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you supposed to do with that, when a boy's friends
come running in here saying all he wants to do is hold a pair of
boots before he dies?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people expect A&AMP;M or the communities to return to
anything close to normal until after the Thanksgiving break. This
week's yell practice and football game, several students said, will
only serve as painful reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Oliver, an associate dean in the College of Liberal
Arts and an English professor, hopes that by early December the
campus won't still be so obviously grieving. Although Oliver isn't
sure things will turn around until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we talk about on a college campus is the future _ the
future of the students, the future of the world, the future of the
university,'' Oliver said. ``When events like this happen, you
can't talk about futures.''

IN KUNG FU, ONLY THE MUSCLES SCREAM 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ANDREA HIGBIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kung fu is the martial art with the silliest song _ Carl
Douglas' ``Kung Fu Fighting'' of 1974 _ and most revered
practitioner: Bruce Lee, whose fans became even more cultlike after
he died of a brain edema in 1973 at the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
   So with the song dancing in my head (``Everybody was kung fu
fighting/Those cats were fast as lightning/In fact it was a little
bit frightening/But they fought with expert timing'') and in
observance of what would have been Lee's 59th birthday (Nov. 27),
off I went to the nearest kung fu parlor, Al Bender's Kung Fu
Academy of New Jersey, in Bloomfield.
</P>
<P>
   If you were thinking that a man named Al Bender might not be the
most apt instructor of the ancient art of kung fu, you would be
wrong. Bender is a man Bruce Lee would have had to admire. Strong
and fairly silent like Lee (his early idol, by the way, no surprise
that), he talks philosophy before practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy is in the movement,'' said Bender, 43, who
began his training in 1977 and studied with Peter Kwok, a martial
arts grandmaster, and Bow Sim Mark, a master. ``You can overcome
your opponent with basic technique but you must overcome yourself
with advanced technique. That means: always strive for higher
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kung fu is proclaimed to be the most holistic of the martial
arts, with its practice of self-defense, exercise, precision and
spiritual achievement. The Chinese say it can be done in the space
of a lying cow: One needs nothing but concentration and desire.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's classes in the large second-floor studio decorated
with trophies and yin-yang posters are much like the Douglas song
(minus the cats). About 25 men, teen-age boys and young boys along
with a smattering of women meet every Saturday morning for two
hours. For most exercises, each student is paired with a partner of
similar strength. For punching and kicking, one student holds small
padded targets, moving them quickly so the other must adjust his
eye, hand and foot coordination to hit them.
</P>
<P>
   My partner was Sarah, an enthusiastic student in her 30s who was
graceful in her loose black tunic and pants. She promised not to
punch or kick me and, I'm happy to report, kept her word. Students
do get bonked every now and then; I've seen the bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Three teachers _ sifus _ roam and instruct, prod and encourage
as the class works offensively and defensively. Kung fu is a
``special kind of skill, a fine art rather than just a physical
exercise,'' Lee wrote, and I found myself being turned into ... an
artist. The instruction to this end is exacting, to a fault: By the
50th pivot kick at a standing padded target, I was not so inclined
to continue perfecting my form as I had been 40 kicks earlier, but
under the gaze of my sifus, continue I did.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone cheers everyone else on, even grinning as the little
boys romp through their exercises. ``We're like a family,'' Edelyn,
a student who said she gave up aerobics classes for kung fu, told
me, and I took this to mean a happy family, despite the punching
and kicking. John, another student, assured me that in a couple of
weeks I'd be able to do the moves in my sleep. Not sure my husband
would appreciate that, I still pressed on, feeling the beginnings
of what would become 72 hours of assertively throbbing muscles,
with pain spreading like a rumor in my forearms, upper back and
inner thighs.
</P>
<P>
   Sifu Al took Justin, the other new student, and me aside, and
called to Sifu Rafael to ``teach them a lesson.'' Uh-oh. But the
lesson, fortunately, involved kicking a big inanimate target as
well as defending myself, hypothetically, against Justin's punches.
Defense is crucial to kung fu, which also means having the smarts
to retreat when your opponent is bigger and stronger, which for me
at 5-foot-5 would be pretty much all of the time and was definitely
the case with Justin, who crowded 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Though this was Justin's first lesson, it was clear that he had
done some serious time practicing in front of the mirror. He was at
most 18, but he moved like a person who had watched a lot of kung
fu movies, Bruce Lee's ``Enter the Dragon'' and ``Fists of Fury''
among them. Symbolism is important here: dragon connotes wisdom.
(Fists, the obvious.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponent is but the other complementary (not opposite)
part,'' Lee is quoted in John Little's new book, ``Bruce Lee:
Artist of Life'' (Tuttle, $24.95). Justin and I were perfectly
complementary; he punched, I ducked.
</P>
<P>
   Kung fu is quiet; no one is screaming or breaking boards with
bare hands and feet, as in karate. Concentration is essential.
There are hundreds of styles of kung fu, derived from northern and
southern China as well as Vietnam, India and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the arts practiced today are less than 150 years old,
whereas traditional kung fu can trace its lineage back 4,000 years
and possibly 6,000 years,'' said Michael J. Formica, assistant
instructor at the Chinese Kung Fu Wu Su Association in Manhattan,
adding that humor was long a part of the martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Christian missionaries were first in China, they saw
people doing t'ai chi and chi kung and asked, `What's that?' They
were told `kung fu,' or `hard work,''' said Formica (pronounced
for-MEEKA). ``Not understanding the joke, they began referring to
wu su martial arts as `kung fu,' and it stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work'' is right. ``Rife with paradox'' is also a true
description, as is ``obsessively complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person grabs you, he is in control, right?'' said
Formica. ``Wrong. You are in control, because that person has made
a commitment to action, while your options are all still available
to you. By virtue of his offensive act, your defensive act becomes
offensive. Personally, that took me about 20 years to grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   A subtle spirituality, over time, is of the essence. ``A  &UR; real &LR; 
martial artist, not these punch-kick-punch-kick guys, will tell you
that fighting is ancillary to practice and just a happy benefit,''
Formica added.
</P>
<P>
   If pain was gain, then I'd accumulated a ton of it. But four
days later, in time for the Wednesday night hourlong class devoted
to form, my muscles were beginning to feel like themselves again.
Good thing, too, because it was time to stretch them past all
recognition. Now I know, should I ever need to do this again, that
I can squat, bend my left knee to the floor and stretch my right
leg all the way out to the right. In striving for higher
achievement, I also know that I can hop back up and stand straight,
bend down and swing my head past my knees _ without fainting!
</P>
<P>
   The forms necessary to set into action the punches and kicks are
intricate and precise. Let us just say that if your feet are not at
perfect 45-degree angles in the first position, a sifu will let you
know about it. And watch while you correct it. The type of kung fu
practiced here _ Chuan Su Er Shur Fa _ has 20 forms; we focused on
the first two, and tried the first 10. No. 9 _ ``Hidden Punch'' _
involves striking the opponent while deflecting his force; trust
me, it's impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The high kicks were fun and allowed me to indulge in my favorite
fantasy career, Rockette. (With sneakers.) I was advised to add my
punches to the kicking and told that I would ``feel it'' the next
day. I'm not an exercise neophyte but as punching and kicking are
not normally activities I do every day (though I know I could get
used to this, especially with the right targets), that promise came
true.
</P>
<P>
   So kick and punch I did, over and over, the words of ``Kung Fu
Fighting'' urging me on. If I was not fast as lightning, at least I
can say I was, to the little boys in the class perhaps, a little
bit frightening. The expert timing is another story.

PHYSICISTS TAKE AIM AT GEOLOGY'S THEORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif. Mass. N.J. N.Y., Pa.)   (af)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William Dietrich has walked, driven and flown over more
natural landscapes than he can remember. As a veteran
geomorphologist, he has studied how everything from the plop of a
raindrop to mighty landslides and geologic uplift have shaped the
face of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   So when he admits to the growing influence on his field of an
insurgent group of physicists, mathematicians and engineers with
all-encompassing mathematical theories but hardly any field
experience, the earth almost begins to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Geology, a field that has always gloried in descriptive detail
but has had less luck deriving mathematical generalizations, is
changing. Invigorated by satellite maps, supercomputers and fresh
ideas from physics, researchers are deriving sweeping theories
without ever having put hammer to rock.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is unsettling to some old-school geologists, but even
they concede that the work has prompted new research in traditional
academic circles. While the new researchers have not yet proved
that the shape of every hill and dale can be predicted by simple
equations, they have at least raised the question of whether
landscapes are sculptured by something other than a reductionistic
accumulation of forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, they irritate us,'' said Dietrich, a professor
at the University of California in Berkeley, speaking for
university and government geologists.
</P>
<P>
   But Dietrich added that the new, physics-inspired theories of
landscape formation, which have found success by ignoring the
detail-oriented approach of traditional geology and focusing
instead on the earth's overall patterns, are ``a way of discussing
some sense of regularity in what otherwise is a very messy world.
I've come to appreciate the perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ideas long familiar in physics, and fueled by the
recent availability of high-quality satellite maps of much of the
planet's surface, the new approach turns the earth sciences on
their head, asserting that the most prominent structures on the
surface of the planet are shaped not by just local factors, as had
been thought but by the most general properties of physics and
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new research, said Dr. Andrea Rinaldo, a
mathematician and engineer at the University of Padua, is to
uncover ``a fundamental, hidden order that manifests itself across
a wide range of scales,'' seeking universal laws amid the welter of
processes, as physicists do with their theories.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the traditional view concentrates on how river
basins, mountain slopes and badland canyons emerge as specific
forces like weathering, erosion and sedimentation do their work
throughout the eons at every point of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand patterns that seem so consistent from one range of
hills or network of rivers to the next, such as the precise ways in
which tributaries snake around and multiply in number in the
upstream direction to drain an area of a certain size, have always
been a bit mysterious from the vantage of traditional geology. It
is as if voters in every democracy in the world opted to divide
their countries into the same number of provinces or states, even
though there was no international campaign to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the theorists. They find strikingly similar patterns
emerge from simple approaches like assuming that the paths that
tributaries cut are those that minimize the energy expended by all
the water running down the basin. The principle that nature often
takes the path of least resistance has helped physicists cut
through other complex phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the point of view that there are certain generic
processes, and therefore equations'' that describe them, said Dr.
Daniel H. Rothman, a professor in the department of earth,
atmospheric and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Ignacio Rodriguez-Iturbe, a professor in the
department of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton
University, said that ``regardless of the infinite variety that you
find in river basins, there are some scaling laws that hold
amazingly well for the different ones.'' He cites the structure of
tributaries as a prime example of that kind of scaling.
</P>
<P>
   And behind laws like those, said Dr. Donald L. Turcotte, a
geophysicist at Cornell University, could lie manifestly practical
insights on subjects like land use, helping planners predict the
frequency of large landslides and inland floods or estimate
long-term erosion _ all questions that are extremely difficult to
answer with straightforward geology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pretty useful material that comes out of all
that,'' Turcotte said. ``I think it's one of the frontiers of
science.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also say that geology gives them an exciting new
field of play for mathematical techniques that were developed in
more mature areas of research _ like the theory of how solids melt
or metals become magnetized _ where rapid advances are now hard to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   But the incursion of high-flown physics ideas into geology has
been driven by more than just the creative powers of the new
theorists. What has largely freed them to think about landscapes
without tramping over them is the recent availability of
high-resolution maps of elevations along the earth's surface made
by satellites and distributed by the United States Geological
Survey and other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Digital maps made with point-by-point elevation measurements
obtained by satellite are available for most of the world with a
resolution, or smallest discernable detail along the surface, of
about three-fifths of a mile, said Peter Dodds, a graduate student
in the mathematics department at MIT who is working with Rothman.
But large parts of the United States have been mapped to a
resolution ofabout 100 feet, Dodds said, and better techniques,
some of them relying on range-finding lasers for determining
elevations are just coming into play.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, they've come from maps people have put
together, partly on foot, partly on airplanes,'' Dodds said. ``Now
they're getting it straight from above.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians like Dodds thirst for exactly the sort of data
that those maps provide. He and other theorists pour the digital
elevations into computers that compile statistics on the number of
hills and mountains of every size in some landscapes _ from bumps
to snowy peaks _ or all of the almost countless paths that water
could take down a basin during a storm.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing those statistics from landscape to landscape, the
scientists try to find general rules governing the patterns that
cover the earth's surface, and then explain why the rules should
hold true.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close examination of many river basin maps by Rinaldo,
Dr. Rodriguez-Iturbe and others several years ago that ignited the
current burst of research, said Dr. Jayanth R. Banavar, a physicist
at Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Given the elevation data, computers could trace the downhill
paths that water should take from any point on the terrain of the
basins, Banavar said. Not surprisingly, those paths drew out a
dendritic pattern that branches ever more finely in moving up the
basin from a central river past its tributaries, the tributaries'
tributaries, and so on; and more finely still among the small
channels in the hillsides that flow with water only when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern is generally called a river network, but ``one that
has been derived just by looking at the rugged terrain,'' rather
than the flowing water itself, Banavar said. But how can this be
analyzed statistically?
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, geologists and hydraulic engineers used maps of
ordinary rivers and streams to show that if a patch containing some
of the smaller tributaries was expanded, as though with a zoom
lens, it would look approximately like a patch of larger
tributaries in the same basin.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists had filed away that odd fact, but the physics-minded
researchers showed, by analyzing the derived river networks on
computers, that similar relations held to good accuracy for
virtually every fold of the landscapes. The analysis showed that
smaller sub-basins looked like larger basins, as long as the zoom
was done properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are basins within basins within basins,'' Banavar said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the correspondence precise, the basins had to be
stretched slightly more in one direction, along the main basin,
than across. And the difference in those stretch factors, expressed
quantitatively as exponents in a set of power laws, gave the
researchers a target to aim for when coming up with a theory to
explain why the network patterns should be so reliable and
widespread around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldo and Rodriguez-Iturbe took as a hint the way that
electrical current flows through a complicated set of wires and
resistors. In that case, the current always distributes itself so
that the amount of energy being dissipated as heat in the resistors
is as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, the researchers theorized, the channels etched in the
landscape over the centuries formed patterns that allowed water to
dissipate the least possible gravitational energy on its way
downhill.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a simple but powerful erosion equation
developed in part by Banavar and Dr. Amos Maritan of the
International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, the
researchers could match the exponents if they made one further
assumption: the landscape never quite etched its way to the minimum
energy state, but got hung up in certain stable configurations it
encountered on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resulting network was in magnificent agreement with the
observations,'' Maritan said.
</P>
<P>
   The story does not end there, since Rothman and others are using
ever sharper satellite data to search for deviations from the power
laws, or to find whether some other overriding principle can
explain the patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical implications of the work could already be
substantial, since the stability of certain aspects of the patterns
could yield clues into how an eroding landscape will and will not
change in the future, helping planners estimate the impact of
development or farming. The frequency of large floods and
landslides could be closely related to the same patterns; large
cataclysms of that kind are among the natural forces that rearrange
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   A close understanding of how water shapes the terrestrial
surface would also allow scientists to compare its statistical
properties with the landscapes of Mars and determine whether they,
too, were once shaped by water or something else.
</P>
<P>
   For all the insights of the new research, geologists are far
from abandoning their worldview. In fact, they too are using
satellite data _ to perform detailed computer calculations of how
rain and wind erode one particular landscape into another over
time.
</P>
<P>
   But even there, Dietrich said, the physics-oriented researchers
have inspired discoveries order amid the reductionistic detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The places where they accomplish that,'' Dietrich said,
``will, I think, have a lasting effect on how we think about the
planet.''

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What happens to a couple when one partner suddenly
becomes ill and dependent? How will a lover react to a scarred or
missing breast, a bald head, a woman who wakes up crying in the
middle of the night, wondering how much time she has left?
</P>
<P>
   Those issues may come up at any support group for women with
breast cancer, and the five couples who discussed them at Beth
Israel Medical Center in Manhattan on a recent evening were no
different from most, except in one essential way.
</P>
<P>
   Both the patients and their partners were women: the group had
been created specifically for lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that lesbians need or want a separate support group
may seem puzzling to the larger heterosexual world. Of all
diseases, breast cancer would seem to be the one that should unite
women from every walk of life.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a supposedly enlightened era and a smugly
sophisticated city, gay and straight do not always mix. The women
who met at Beth Israel said they needed their own group not because
they were uncomfortable with straight women, but because straight
women were uncomfortable with lesbians. And they said that as much
as they wanted to talk about breast cancer with other women, if the
lesbian group had not been formed, they would not have joined a
support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is safe,'' said one of the group's members, Cheryl
Dessin, whose partner, Barbara Slatos, was treated for breast
cancer last year. ``It's a very comfortable atmosphere. We can say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slatos said it was bad enough to have breast cancer without
having to worry about being judged or looked down on by
heterosexual women in a support group, or having to masquerade as
straight to avoid their disapproval. ``That would be unendurable,''
she said. ``There are many, many homophobics out there, even in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Crespi, a therapist who acts as facilitator for the group,
said, ``You don't want to have to think about being gay when you're
dealing with something that is life and death.'' In a group where
everyone is gay, she said, ``you don't have to justify or explain
your life to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   There are not many groups like the one at Beth Israel, but
people involved with health care problems confronting gay women say
they expect that additional groups will be created, as an outgrowth
of other medical and social services designed especially for
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the increased awareness has resulted from the efforts of
advocacy groups for health care for lesbians. There are now about a
dozen such groups in the United States, according to the Mautner
Project for Lesbians with Cancer, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors discriminate, researchers discriminate, insurers
discriminate,'' said Kathleen DeBold, executive director of the
Mautner Project. ``Cancer does not discriminate, and that's why
these projects are so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesbians in long-term, stable relationships are often denied the
right to make decisions for a severely ill partner, Ms. DeBold
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a client who couldn't get into the intensive care unit
to see her lover except by posing as her sister,'' Ms. DeBold said.
``When the woman's family came, they said, `That's not her sister,'
and the hospital threw her out. This is the kind of thing people go
through all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeBold said that when her own partner of more than 20 years
was being treated in an emergency room, a doctor determined that
she was not a blood relative and told her that if she did not leave
he would have her removed by a guard.
</P>
<P>
   The same insensitivity can come out even in support groups.
</P>
<P>
   Terri O'Hara, director of Lesbian Cancer Support Services in
Denver, said, ``The ideal is that it shouldn't matter. We should be
able to walk into a room and feel completely comfortable exposing
our lifestyles. But we hear hurtful and hateful things every day.
I've had lesbians say they went to support groups and other women
left if they brought or even mentioned their female partners.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, Ms. O'Hara said, women who join mainstream
groups decide to stay in the closet, avoiding mention of their
partners or referring to them in a vague way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cover up,'' Ms. O'Hara said. ``It's a lot of work. It can
be exhausting. You're not feeling well, you're emotionally in
turmoil, you have financial concerns. It's a vulnerable time to
worry about outing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern among gay women who have partners is that
the partners be able to attend the support group. Several lesbians
said they thought gay partners were probably more interested in
participating than husbands were. But even if husbands did want to
attend, the idea of the gay partners sharing their feelings with
the straight husbands somehow was not a comfortable scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``With breast cancer, so many women I've talked to who have
tried going to a regular support group find that the women spend a
lot of time talking about husbands and how husbands can't accept
their body image,'' Ms. DeBold said. ``Most lesbians do not have
that kind of problem in their relationships. The perception of the
female body is different. Lesbians tend to be much more loving and
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Siegel, a member of the Beth Israel group, was treated
for breast cancer in 1991 and joined a mainstream support group.
She was 57 then but had not told her doctors or the other women in
the group she was a lesbian, or mentioned that she had a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why I didn't say it, I can't even tell you,'' she said. ``I
don't know why. I knew I was the only lesbian in the group.
Everybody else spoke about a boyfriend or a husband. I didn't mind
being there as long as we stuck to the matter of cancer, but there
were times when some of these women had to refer to their mates. I
felt a kind of lack. I would have liked to have said something
also. Maybe I should have. It probably wouldn't have made a
difference, but maybe I thought they wouldn't welcome me as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she said, her attitude is different: ``I think it took
the cancer and possibly living in New York for a while for me to
say, I'm a person, I live in New York, I pay my taxes, I have a
right to be a lesbian. I came through the cancer, I met my maker
and I am what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crespi said that many gay women, particularly older ones who
grew up when there was far less acceptance, cannot help but expect
straight people to disparage them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's internalized homophobia,'' Ms. Crespi said. ``As gay
people, it's difficult to escape your own feelings of, `I'm not
going to be treated well or valued, people are going to be
prejudiced.' We grow up with a history of a lot of very negative
feelings, and the fear is really there all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   A mixed group might be successful if it were identified from the
outset as open to both gay and straight women, so that members
would by definition be people who were willing to accept each
other's lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be wonderful,'' Ms. DeBold said. ``A cancer support
group is not the place to deal with issues about sexual
orientation. That's the goal, that one day the barriers will be
removed.''

TRACKING GROUND WATER'S UNWELCOME GUESTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT A. SAAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Industrial solvents and related chemicals are present in the
ground water used to provide drinking water for 35 million to 50
million Americans, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which
is about to publish the first national report card on the presence
of these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals, called volatile organic compounds, generally
occur in trace amounts that pose little threat to public health.
But their presence is a warning that better safeguards are needed
to prevent further contamination, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the work is to be published next month in the
journal Environmental Science &AMP; Technology and has been posted on
the Internet at wwwsd.cr.usgs.gov /nawqa/pubs/journal/.
</P>
<P>
   Volatile organic compounds, which contain carbon and evaporate
easily, are used in many industries and are present in gasoline and
household products like cleaning solvents.
</P>
<P>
   Because some, like benzene, a gasoline component, are known
human carcinogens, only minute amounts are allowed in drinking
water. Others, like xylene, are also present in gasoline but are
less toxic and higher levels are allowed in water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important, statistically valid study,'' said J.
Charles Fox, assistant administrator for water at the federal
Environmental Protection Agency. ``While there is no cause for
alarm, it does show that we can't take drinking water quality for
granted and that we need to be aware of contaminant sources,
especially in urban and suburban areas.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Geological Survey studied ground water from wells. In some
areas, where the ground water is part of a community supply, it may
be treated before being piped to customers, and the chemicals may
be removed. But in private wells, the contaminants may linger.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogorski, a hydrologist who headed the study, said: ``The
results are especially important for people with private wells and
even those consuming water from municipal water systems that do not
treat the water to remove these chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   An EPA hot line is available to answer consumers' questions
about their drinking water. It is (800) 426-4791. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study evaluated data collected from 1985 to 1995 and focused
on areas not thought to be contaminated by spills or industrial
activities. Earlier studies, in contrast, had focused on
pesticides, contaminated areas like hazardous-waste sites, the
resources in a single state, or the quality of water after
treatment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water was tested from 406 urban wells and 2,542 rural wells. One
or more volatile organic compounds were found in 47 percent of the
urban wells and in 14 percent of the rural wells. The EPA's
drinking-water limits for those compounds were exceeded in 6.4
percent of the urban wells and in 1.5 percent of the rural wells. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four most frequently detected of the 60 compounds in the
study were the industrial solvents trichloroethene and
tetrachloroethene, the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether
(MTBE), and trichloromethane (also known as chloroform), which is a
solvent and a byproduct of the disinfection of drinking water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, which is designed to reduce air pollution by allowing
gasoline to burn more cleanly, has been found in many wells across
the country in other studies and in 5.4 percent of the wells in
this study.
</P>
<P>
   Data from 1,500 more wells were collected from 1996 to 1998.
These results, along with data from another 1,500 wells to be
sampled by 2001, are to be covered in a second report card planned
for release in 2002 or-2003.

<P>
   ``CRYING: THE NATURAL &AMP; CULTURAL HISTORY OF TEARS'' &QL; 
By Tom Lutz (Norton, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only humans sob. Weeping is a peculiarity of man _ no other
animals are known to do it. And yet we know surprisingly little
about it, other than the obvious (children cry more than adults do)
and the physiological (reflex tears _ those you produce when you
peel an onion _ have a different chemical composition from
emotional tears). Crying is an escape, a physical act that
distracts us from the trauma that has made us cry. It is also, Lutz
tells us, a kind of language, ``expressing not just our distress
but our demands, not just our desire to be understood but our
desire to evade detection. Our crocodile tears can be used to
ensnare, to confuse, to extort, to deceive. Even those tears we cry
when we are alone have an imagined audience. Even in our deepest
moments of grief, we can be well aware of the effect our tears are
having on those around us.'' This vastly researched,
interdisciplinary study of tears is a delight, in the tradition of
Diane Ackerman's ``A Natural History of the Senses.'' Lutz looks at
how philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists
have interpreted tears over the years. He looks at crying in art
and literature, film and advertisement. He explores the physical
process of crying and its psychological benefits, as well as gender
issues that it raises (powerful women such as Hillary Rodham
Clinton do not cry in public because it could be read as weakness).
He discusses our changing attitudes toward tears, illustrated by
the fact that Edmund Muskie was run out of the 1972 presidential
primary race for crying in front of reporters, whereas Bob Dole,
who remained dry-eyed for the first 40 years of his public life,
cried many times over the past decade without consequence. Finally,
Lutz poses another puzzle: Even if we think we know why we cry, can
we explain why we stop? ``Tears,'' he writes, ``are the most
substantial and yet the most fleeting, the most obvious and yet the
most enigmatic proof of our emotional lives.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LADIES AUXILIARY'' &QL; 
By Tova Mirvis (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This compassionate first novel is the story of the women of an
Orthodox Jewish community in Memphis, Tenn., and their relationship
with a free-spirited woman _ a convert to Judaism _ who comes to
live among them. Batsheva is the widow of Benjamin Jacobs, who has
been killed in a car crash in New York. Hoping to ease her
loneliness and preserve her ties to him, Batsheva brings their
5-year-old daughter to the Memphis community in which Benjamin grew
up. From the start, it's obvious to the other women that Batsheva
does not fit in _ she does not cook or clean, nor does she pay
suitable attention to the modesty of her clothing or to the
dictates of Jewish tradition. But she does bring an understated
self-confidence, a passion for delving into the questions that
religious faith inspires, and a sympathy for the community's young
people, who crave freedom from the obligations to which they were
born. Mirvis tells her story in the collective voice of the Jewish
ladies, a ``we'' that reflects the depth of their traditions, the
vulnerability of those traditions in the modern world and the
oppressive standards that have grown up around them. Mirvis never
loses her compassion for these characters, nor does she ignore the
value of their moral and religious commitments. They are gossipy
and judgmental, yet oddly innocent. And in coming to terms with
their feelings about Batsheva, the women begin to question
themselves. This is a gentle story _ no sex, violence or overt
drama _ written with a deft hand and a sympathetic heart. Mirvis,
who grew up in the Memphis community on which her novel is based,
says her novel is ``emotionally autobiographical.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MISS MANNERS' GUIDE TO DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY''By Judith Martin
(Crown, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The formidable arbiter of taste and tactics turns her eyes to
the home front, where civility often meets the fate of a dead
goldfish. She begins, of course, with the ticklish affairs of the
people of the home front, known as ``The Family.'' This chapter is
so complex, given today's divorce and remarriage statistics, that
New &AMP; Notable had to take notes just to keep up. But Miss Manners
has everything under control. Other headings include ``The Help,''
``The Visitors'' and ``Entertaining the Relatives.'' Our favorite
parts are not Miss Manners' essays on these matters, but the
questions she receives from her gentle readers and the answers she
gives, in which she shows herself capable of gutting a cloddish
correspondent without even a trace of discourtesy. We love Miss
Manners, yes we do. We would suggest, however, that she has written
many books (12); that the overlap is conspicuous; that being
content with one's already considerable fortune is a gracious thing
indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LIKELY STORY'' &QL; 
By Rosemary Mahoney (Anchor, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Miss Manners would wring her hands over Rosemary Mahoney.
There is no civility in this memoir (now new in paperback) of the
summer of 1978, when the 17-year-old Mahoney worked as a domestic
for the woman she thought was her idol, Lillian Hellman. Hellman
was irascible, insulting, bossy, cheap and pathetic. Mahoney was a
teenager, and so not much more pleasant than her employer. The
difference is that Hellman is dead and Mahoney is alive to tell the
tale. Neither woman looks good, although it is Hellman who suffers
the indignity of having her 73-year-old body described through the
eyes of an angry young girl. This is what Miss Manners would
whisper in Rosemary Mahoney's ear: Someday, you will be old. &QL;

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The better Arizona Sen. John McCain
does with the public, the worse he does with his Republican Senate
colleagues. Several of them have made it clear that they don't like
him. But is that a badge of honor reflecting independence and
character or an alarming sign that he might have trouble governing?

NOTRE DAME IS NOT BOWLING ANYONE OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Palm Beach and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   They're tired. They're frustrated. They're hurt. At best, they
will finish with a mediocre 7-5 record and get a bid to a mid-major
bowl like the Insight.Com in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the thought of accepting a bowl bid with
those credentials would have been denied without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, when Notre Dame football was a religious
experience on Saturday afternoons in the fall. When College
Football America took its cue from what happened under the Golden
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This is now. And it's not pretty for longtime followers of the
Irish to accept. Notre Dame football has become . . . ordinary,
which is the harshest thing you can say about the program.
</P>
<P>
   That the team is even considering a bowl bid with such a record
shows you how low the bar has been dropped in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, coach Bob Davie said earlier this week that no decision
on any bowl has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can any be made until after Thanksgiving, even if the Irish
beat Boston College Saturday, since Notre Dame must beat BC then
Stanford next week to become bowl eligible at 7-5, which is the
minimum number of wins for a team that plays a 12-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: What has happened in South Bend? How did Notre
Dame become Indiana or North Carolina State all of a sudden, a
major program that flirts with .500 and is among the also-rans
sooner rather than later in a season?
</P>
<P>
   Most of it has to do with recruiting and the diffusion of talent
across the country with scholarship reductions. Going to Notre Dame
is not that big a deal anymore to the scholar-athletes the Irish
target.
</P>
<P>
   There are other choices. Almost every school and league has some
kind of television package. As an independent, the Irish have no
parachute offered by members of the major conferences, which
guarantee the coveted Bowl Championship Series slots to conference
winners.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent, Notre Dame's schedule is almost suicidal.
Michigan, Michigan State, Purdue, Southern Cal, Arizona State,
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It all looks nice for television ratings, but for a coach, it
looks like a season of misery unless everyone stays healthy and
everyone plays up to their potential.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened this season for the Irish, who are missing
16 players because of injuries and have had five others leave the
team for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Who puts Notre Dame No. 1 on their wish list right now? The
blue-chip quarterback? Sorry. He can go to Miami or Georgia Tech or
Florida or Purdue. The big-time running back? He can go to Virginia
or Wisconsin. The wide receiver? He can go to Florida State or
Arizona State. The linemen? They can go to Nebraska or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And if education is the sole purpose, Duke and Stanford offer a
collegiate experience and big-time football, while Ovy League
schools provide a great edcuation and decent football.
</P>
<P>
   During Lou Holtz's tenure in South Bend, the Irish won a
national championship and 100 games in 11 years, probably as good
as it gets. But Holtz also fiddled with the recruiting classes,
pushing the envelope on who could get in and who could not. The gap
between the football team and the student body widened, was closed,
and widened again as Holtz struggled with the dilemma of all
coaches who have come to the Golden Dome _ find students who are
athletes, who are good enough to win at the heighest level, and
maintain the academic integrity of the university.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his predecessors, Holtz burned out under the harsh
scrutiny. Now Davie, finishing his third year, is being judged.
Holtz won a national championship in his third season, so did Dan
Devine and Ara Parseghian.
</P>
<P>
   That obviously won't haappen this season. People are questioning
whether Davie has the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question that has yet to be answered. Like those who
came before him, including the ill-fated Gerry Faust, Davie
deserves the full five-year run that Notre Dame gives all its
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule will not get easier next year, when Nebraska is
added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that few Irish eyes are smiling these days when
Notre Dame football is discussed, if it is discussed at all.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in South Bend this week has been devoid of anger or
resentment over a team that is now 5-5, with a loss to Pittsburgh,
a loss to Tennessee, and a near-loss to Navy as its last three
results.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is anything that can kill a relationship or a
program, it is indifference, which means the flame of passion has
been extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that seems to be what has happened at Notre Dame.
</P>

   With Rhode Island looking for a new football coach, Rams
officals could do worse than looking to Curry College where Steve
Nelson has done a nice job of reviving that Division 3 program.
Nellie would be a natural fit for URI, someone with name
recognition that could get the Rams jump started, as well as a
proven ability as leader and a coach who can turn a program around
. . . The firing of LSU coach Gerry DiNardo last week was not a
surprise, but give athletic director Joe Dean credit for honesty,
if nothing else. ``Basically, he didn't win enough football
games,'' said Dean, referring to last year's 4-7 mark and this
year's 2-8 record. Dean wants to have a replacement by the first
week of December. Reportedly, the Tigers are looking at Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum, who was under consideration five years ago when
DiNardo was hired. Slocum, who has strong Louisiana ties _ he went
to McNeese State _ did nothing to diffuse the rumors this week. ``I
have a lot of respect for that school,'' he said, ``but that has
nothing to do with getting our team ready to play Texas.'' Slocum
is in the first year of a new seven-year deal and it will require a
payment of $1.8 million . . . The NCAA slapped Division 3 St.
John's with a three-year probation last week. The crime? The school
practiced in pads a few days earlier than rules permitted. Hmm.
What does that mean for Minnesota, which had a major case of
academic fraud? . . . Watch out for UMass. The Minutemen seem
poised for another national chanmpionship run. All they have to do
to clinch a 1-AA playoff berth is beat UConn, something they didn't
do in two tries last season . . . If the Minutemen do get the berth
and win at least a couple of playoff games, consider coach Mark
Whipple on the endangered species list for a move to Division 1-A .
. . Everyone thinks Florida-Florida State is a big deal, which it
is. But in Idaho, nothing is bigger than Saturday's Idaho-Boise
State battle, which will decide the Big West title and give the
winner a berth in the Humanitarian Bowl. In Conference USA,
Southern Miss. and Louisville will battle for a Liberty Bowl berth
Saturday. Want a Coach of the Year candidate? Try Hawaii's June
Jones, who has taken the Rainbows from a winless season last year
and a 19-game losing streak to a share of the WAC title. If Fresno
loses to San Jose State Saturday the Rainbows will earn the title
outright . . . How's this for bad timing. At last week's
Rutgers-Syracuse game, Scarlet Knights radio announcer Bruce
Johnson had to leave early because of a commitment to broadcast the
No. 4 fourth-ranked Rutgers women's basketball team playing a game
in Tennessee against North Carolina State. Naturally, the football
team wins in overtime and Johnson's backup, Neal Solondz, has
soundbites of the finish on all the highlight shows. Oh yeah, the
women's basketball team lost.

WORTHY BIO OF A SENATE LION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- &UR;  &LR; To understand the importance of the best book
written about a significant legislator in ages _ Adam Clymer's
``Edward M. Kennedy'' _ here's a short tale about what the senator
does for a living that occurred too late for inclusion in Clymer's
definitive work.
</P>
<P>
   By semiofficial account, the latest Kennedy caper began in
January and ended last week. It began with a letter to the
bipartisan Medicare Commission (naturally, he arranged for
Republican co-writers) and ended in the last of the late-night
talks on Capitol Hill over a budget package.
</P>
<P>
   In between, you don't want to know how many meetings and
briefings Kennedy arranged between leading congressional figures
and leaders of hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care
front-liners. It is, however, worth noting that he had three
face-to-face meetings with President Clinton on the issue _ one in
late September, one in late October, and the last just three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was literally the health of the basic elements of the
health-care infrastructure, severely put at risk by the unexpected
impact on providers of cutbacks made two years ago in order to
produce the balanced budget deal. That impact was doubly severe in
states with disproportionately large health-care institutions that
serve national needs, not merely local ones _ as in Massachusetts,
which first elected Kennedy 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the senator started 10 months ago with just a few natural
allies, he had neither the ear of Congress's big shots nor the
initial sympathy of the Clinton administration. But by the time he
was finished, it was as if the two official ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue were competing to meet his exquisitely documented concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative package _ to improve the dangerously weakened
financial position of major teaching hospitals, nursing homes, home
health-care providers, and major pediatric facilities _ was worth
about $20 billion over 10 years when introduced in October by
Kennedy and Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. When the
last negotiating session concluded a week ago, the experts were
still figuring out details, but the figure I got was a cool $27
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the health-care infrastructure remains, but its
truly threatening severity has been significantly ameliorated. And
Kennedy will be back in the trenches next year.
</P>
<P>
   In his just-published book, Adam Clymer tells dozens of these
kinds of stories, many with warts attached, but most the kinds of
insight-loaded yarns that cause you to shake your head in
near-wonder. No one has ever bothered to do the hard work to piece
together a serious examination of the Kennedy's career and life _
yet he makes any short list of the most important legislative
figures in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer, a New York Times reporter, is one of those relentless
journalists who understands that the hard way, the inductive way,
is the best way. He loves the game with a passion but is one of the
few who can operate effortlessly in that critical area where
politics and policy mysteriously meet.
</P>
<P>
   In a silly age of buzz, hype, gossip, and garbage, Clymer's book
supplies an uplifting end to a somewhat shabby decade of American
biography. The triumphs, tragedies, successes, flops, and misdeeds
are all there in profound perspective. Clymer breaks enough new
ground to build a small city on. But one story, involving health
care, illustrates both Kennedy's most recent success and the roots
of his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   It involves Columbia Point, the failed public housing project in
Boston's Dorchester neighborhood that back in 1966 produced at
least one huge success _ a health clinic. Simply by existing, the
clinic meant that mothers with kids had ready access to basic
services, instead of spending hours on buses and the subway getting
to facilities downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was there in August and in December, back when Medicare
and Medicaid were in their infancy. But he also had gotten a $51
million appropriation through Congress to help establish another 30
such neighborhood centers around the country. As Clymer tells it,
Kennedy carefully nurtured the effort until by 1995 there were some
850 clinics in urban and rural areas serving 9 million people.
</P>
<P>
   And for good measure, when Reagan tried to end it all, Kennedy
took him on (with carefully recruited Republican support as usual)
and clobbered him.
</P>
<P>
   Health care is a good for-instance, because the failure to
obtain national insurance is an enduring Kennedy frustration (his
first bill was introduced nearly 30 years ago). But he never gives
in, and he toils with the same grass roots mania he first displayed
organizing the West for his brother in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing only accomplishment and not longevity, and spanning
an incredible range of huge domestic and foreign policy concerns,
his full career is without parallel. In actual, measurable impact
on the lives of tens of millions of working familes, the elderly,
and the needy, Kennedy belongs in the same sentence with Franklin
Roosevelt.

`OPEN HOUSE' PITCH OMITS 2 KEY WORDS: TIME SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE M PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all heard the pitch: For just a little bit of your time,
you'll receive an assortment of fabulous gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Charves got the pitch recently from a woman named Holly at
the Colonial Acres Resort in West Yarmouth, Mass., a time-share
operation, although no mention of that was made in the pitch. In
return for coming to an ``open house,'' Charves was promised two
free roundtrip airline tickets to a destination of her choice from
a list including Florida, California, Hawaii, and the Caribbean; a
free three-day, two-night getaway to any of 45 US cities; and gift
certificates to the Red Lobster or Olive Garden restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Charves was skeptical _ ``I'm no idiot,'' she said _ but she
thought a trip with her children to Cape Cod and two free airline
tickets would be a productive outing.
</P>
<P>
   One of Charves's daughters has ataxia telangiectasia, a deadly
genetic disease that afflicts only about 650 children in the United
States. Charves wants to raise awareness of the disease, and
planned to donate the airline tickets to raise money for research.
</P>
<P>
   Charves said she asked Holly repeatedly whether the tickets were
really free and whether she had to buy anything to get them. She
even asked for assurances in writing and Holly sent her the script
of her pitch. ``It says flat out, two free airline tickets,''
Charves said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tickets weren't really free. The time-share industry may
be gaining respectability with the entry of big-name companies such
as Marriott, Hyatt, and Disney, but many resorts continue to
deceive would-be customers into thinking they are getting something
valuable for their time.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's trade group admits that the No. 1 consumer
complaint about time shares is deceptive marketing practices
(including promotional sweepstakes contests, as we wrote about last
week). And the Massachusetts attorney general has received several
dozen complaints about time-share resorts since 1996, including
four involving Colonial Acres.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McCauley, director of marketing for Colonial Acres, said
he goes to great lengths to treat would-be customers fairly. He
said the gifts he offers consumers have a retail value of about
$550. And to make sure his telephone solicitors don't mislead
people (they get paid based on how many people they bring to the
resort), he has a manager follow up with each person who agrees to
a visit. A letter is also sent to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is spelled out for them,'' McCauley said. ``We try
to do everything the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charves said she never received a follow-up letter or phone
call. What was sent _ the script that Holly had read _ showed how
deceptive the pitch is.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of a time-share presentation. ``All we are
going to do is walk you around the facilities and show you our
beach and models in the hopes that if you like what you see, you'll
come back and stay with us in the future,'' the pitch said.
</P>
<P>
   McCauley said ``time share'' is not mentioned because consumers
have the wrong idea about it. ``The words have the connotation of a
skull and crossbones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   The two free roundtrip airline tickets, offered by a company
called Fly Free America, are an homage to semantics. They are free
only if you spend a certain number of days at a resort in the
destination city and pay the resort's top room rate. But at those
prices, the tickets are hardly free.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you want to fly to Hawaii and stay at the Waikiki Joy.
Using Fly Free America, two people could fly to Hawaii for free in
March as long as they stay a minimum of 13 nights at the Waikiki
Joy at $280 a night. That works out to $3,640, not including room
or departure taxes and transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Ann Bellanti at Colpitts Travel in Dedham, Mass. was able to
book the same trip on American Airlines and a suite at the Joy for
$2,885, with transfers and taxes included, for a savings of more
than 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trips closer to home and of shorter duration are more
cost-effective, but still no bargain. Using Fly Free America, a
four-night stay at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando in
February would cost $1,400, not including taxes and transfers.
Bellanti was able to book the same trip on Delta for $1,323 with
taxes, transfers, and a free shuttle to Disney World included.
</P>
<P>
   The free three-day, two-night getaway to any of 45 destinations
doesn't include transportation and it hinges on a second time-share
solicitation. According to Mini-Vacations Inc., the company running
the program, guests select a destination and then are booked at a
motel there. The motel bill is paid for by a nearby time-share
resort, which then targets the travelers for another time-share
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The one gift with no strings attached was the $30 gift
certificate to the Red Lobster or Olive Garden restaurants. Charves
used her certificate at Olive Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For Colonial Acres, the restaurant certificate was probably the
most expensive gift offered. The company that owns Red Lobster and
Olive Garden sells the certificates to companies like Colonial
Acres at a 10 to 15 percent discount. Mini-Vacations Inc. said it
charges $3 for its getaway packages and Fly Free America charges
$7.50 to $10, depending on how many trips are purchased. The
estimated cost of the Colonial Acres pitch to the time-share
resort: About $40.

   Phone bill aggravation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's incredible to us that a long-distance phone company called
International Plus, which targets Asian immigrants, has a slogan
with the words ``simple solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least one case involving a Somerville couple who moved
here from Taiwan, this company refused the most simple solution to
a complicated problem that it created.
</P>
<P>
   Before contacting us, Hong Wang, 37, a hospital researcher,
tried for several weeks to resolve a $50 billing problem he had
with International Plus, also known as NOS Communications. After
canceling the carrier because of bad phone connections, he was hit
with an array of unannounced extra fees.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Las Vegas, told him the extra fees were
imposed because low calling rates are promised on the condition
that he stay with the company for six months and meet minimum
monthly usage requirements. Wang said he and his wife were never
told about these rules when a Chinese-speaking telemarketer sold
them on the plan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest bill, a 24-minute call to Taiwan, for example, was
recalculated at a rate of $1.74 a minute, instead of 29 cents a
minute. He was also hit with a $10 monthly management fee.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang declined to pay, the company threatened to take his
case to a collections agency that could begin legal action.
</P>
<P>
   When Wang asked for our help, we agreed to step in, largely
because we have long suspected that firms specializing in ethnic
marketing may take advantage of these new-to-America consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, we didn't have much luck either. After placing
numerous phone calls to the company's 800 phone number, it declined
to address the Wang case with a reporter and refused to give out
the phone number of company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Tuesday, after obtaining the headquarters phone
number through an Internet site, we reached a company attorney who
intervened. Wang was told later by the company he would get about
$50 in credit for the disputed fees. In the future, Wang said he
will be far more suspicious of telemarketing calls and demand all
rules in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we learned our lesson the hard way,'' Wang said.

POLL SHOWS BUSH, GORE LEAD RIVALS IN CALIFORNIA PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush have comfortable leads over their party rivals with four
months to go before the primary in voter-rich California, according
to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attracted more than double the support won by former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, his main Democratic rival. And nearly
twice as many voters said they would pick Bush over his chief
Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, commissioned by the San Francisco Examiner and
KTVU-TV, also found that Bush may be vulnerable to Gore and Bradley
in head-to-head matchups. The survey showed Gore leading Bush by 2
percentage points. It also showed Bradley leading Bush by a single
point when paired in a hypothetical November election.
</P>
<P>
   This statistical dead heat comes despite Bradley's fourth-place
showing when all the candidates are lumped together in the survey,
as they will be in California's March 7 open primary. The open
primary allows Democrats and Republicans to cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that if Bush emerges as the Republican nominee, he
will have to overcome several factors to win the state's 54
electoral votes in November 2000. Those factors include his
conservative record as governor of Texas, a lingering anger with
the Republican Party among the state's growing numbers of Hispanic
voters and the lack of a powerful force motivating change.
</P>
<P>
   If California voters continue down the same political path they
took in the state in recent election, Democrats may have the edge
in 2000. President Clinton won here over former President George
Bush in 1992 and again against former Sen. Bob Dole in 1996. Last
year, Democrats swept statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very tough state for Bush to win,'' said
Del Ali, of Research 2000 of Rockville, Md., which conducted the
poll of 802 registered California voters. The survey was done Nov.
16-18 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed Bradley and Gore getting more support
than Bush among women. Bush, who opposes abortion, is viewed as a
moderate, in part because of his message of ``compassionate
conservatism.'' He also appears to have picked up a significant
number of women voters since former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole dropped out of the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``I don't think women voters have been in play for
them, and I think that's a big problem,'' Ali said of the Bush
campaign. ``I think the soccer moms, the women voters are starting
to take a look, and if Bush stays moderate, he can fulfill the
challenge. But if he moves rightward, I think it's a matter of time
before the gender gap comes into play like it did in the last
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey is a brief snapshot of the campaign. The political
scene could change dramatically over the next few months as
candidates begin advertising and campaign in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner/KTVU random telephone survey was conducted of
people who said they vote regularly. The party affiliation mirrored
registration figures in California: 46 percent of those polled were
Democrats, 36 percent were Republican, and 18 percent either
belonged to third parties or declined to state which party they
support.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings of the survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore was viewed the most favorably, but he also has the
highest unfavorable rating among the major candidates, 42 percent.
Bush's unfavorable rating was lower, 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pat Buchanan, who left the GOP to seek the Reform Party's
nomination for the presidency, was disliked more than any other
candidate _ by 58 percent of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buchanan would take away votes from Bush in a three-way race.
The survey showed Gore with 47 percent support and Bush dropping to
42 percent support when Buchanan is entered into the race. Buchanan
picked up only 5 percent of those surveyed, but he took all his
votes from Bush. The same scenario occurs in a
Bradley-Bush-Buchanan race.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush and Gore split the Asian vote, but Gore leads
overwhelmingly among African-American and Hispanics. White voters
tend to favor Bush by a slight margin of 5 percentage points. Bush,
however, had a surprisingly high 37 percent of the Hispanic vote
compared to Gore's 57 percent. That shows Bush appears to have
dissolved some of the animosity the Republican Party in California
collected with its support of the anti-immigration measure
Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics are still with Democrats,'' Ali said. ``I'm not
surprised. There was big talk with Bush doing so well with
Hispanics in Texas. That's the governor's race. That's Texas. Now
we're talking about an ethnic group still upset. This is a
tremendous gap among voters. The glass may be half-empty more than
half-full for Bush on this issue.''

Y2K LONG SHOT: US-RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It would be the world's most extreme Y2K computer
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As improbable as it may be, the possibility of a mistaken launch
of nuclear missiles just as the world celebrates the new millennium
has antiatomic activists pushing anew for disarmament of all US and
Russian nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say flatly that Y2K computer problems will not
cause any accidental launch of a nuclear missile.
</P>
<P>
   But arms control specialists cannot completely rule out a Y2K
doomsday scenario, which could start with computer malfunctions in
Russia that cause early-warning systems to give erroneous
indications of a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under this hypothetical scenario, Russian President Boris
N. Yeltsin could order the activation of the country's ``dead
hand'' system, which ensures nuclear retaliation in case an attack
kills the entire Moscow leadership. Next, the Y2K bug could shut
down the communication between Russia's central command and the
dead hand computer apparatus, which would proceed to launch
missiles on the basis of the false indications of an incoming
attack.
</P>
<P>
   And that, according to some disarmament activists, could bring
nuclear holocaust as Russia sends hundreds of nuclear missiles
toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Much would have to go wrong for such a cataclysmic event to
occur, but such technical and human error is not absolutely out of
the question, some arms specialists warn.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, to add another layer of safety to prevent an
accidental launch, President Clinton and Yeltsin created a joint
Y2K control room at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.
There Russian and US officials will sit side-by-side beginning in
late December to minimize the chances of a Y2K-triggered false
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But the scenario described above is based on a ``Dr.
Strangelove''-like system that exists in Russia, notably the dead
hand computer program, which remains in the hands of Moscow despite
the joint command center in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   And the scenario comes against a backdrop of rising Russian
anger against the United States, the most recent point of conflict
occurring last week in Clinton's pointed criticism of the war in
Chechnya. Pentagon officials say Russia has embarked on a campaign
of nuclear muscle-flexing to show its displeasure, including a
recent test of two submarine-launched missiles and Russia's threats
to send nuclear bombers to Cuba and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But an ongoing worry persists around Russia's deteriorating and
incomplete early-missile warning system, underscoring the dangers
of having an estimated 5,000 Russian and US nuclear missiles on a
hair-trigger _ Y2K or no Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   While the missiles are no longer targeted on cities and nuclear
sites, they are loaded with guidance systems that, on the United
States side, can be programmed in as little time as 10 seconds,
literally a flip of the switch and then two computer keystrokes,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the Y2K risks are low, it's important for people to
appreciate the overall risks here,'' said Bruce Blair, a Brookings
Institution senior fellow and a recipient this year of a MacArthur
Foundation ``genius grant,'' who has written extensively about
possible doomsday nuclear scenarios, including the dead hand
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Blair and others, Y2K is a unique event, and thus
the threat cannot be calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inestimable,'' Blair said. ``Anyone who claims to know
the probability of Y2K early-warning failure in Russia is pulling
it out of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, US and Russian officials have tried to assure
the public that Y2K poses no risk of a nuclear shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
   Following a federal government report on the Y2K problem earlier
this month, the White House said in a statement: ``Y2K problems
will not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves. Nuclear
weapons launch requires human intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the worries of Y2K problems with Russia's nuclear system
``have gotten blown way out of proportion. We expect minor glitches
in Russia, nothing of great severity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Colorado center, American officials will share data from
the US global early warning network.
</P>
<P>
   But distrust lingers, even at the joint command center. US
officials will not share everything from the early-warning network
for fear of giving away secrets to the Russians, and the Russians
have rejected US requests to set up another joint Y2K control
center in Russia because of their own wariness of giving away
intelligence secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Ill feeling has gradually built up between the two nation's
militaries since the early euphoria following the breakup of the
Soviet Union. It deepened among the Russian military hierarchy in
recent months with the expansion of NATO eastward to include three
more countries; with NATO's war against Serb forces in Kosovo; and
with US intentions to build a national missile defense system that
would violate the antiballistic missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Five US arms control specialists, some working for the Clinton
administration or Congress and some at universities, have said
recently that their contacts in Russia have dried up because
Russian intelligence agents have told scientists to cease contacts
with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, the possible Y2K threat has galvanized many
antinuclear activists, including Helen M. Caldicott, author
Jonathan Schell, and former arms negotiator Paul Nitze, who have
called on Clinton in full-page newspaper advertisements to
``de-alert'' thousands of nuclear missiles. De-alerting literally
means taking missiles off high alert, removing the hair trigger by
dismantling missile components.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts
Democrat, introduced a resolution calling for immediate de-alerting
of nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But US and Russian officials have rejected the idea. US Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen said in Moscow recently that de-alerting
was ``off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles, according to Pentagon officials and arms control
specialists, lie in verification and lack of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the US and Russia see each as potential
adversaries, this is going to be the situation'' of missiles on
hair-trigger, said Theodore A. Postol, a MIT professor of science,
technology, and national security policy. ``That will also be the
situation if one side sees itself as vulnerable to a damaging
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   That now would be Russia, because its nuclear forces are
``extremely vulnerable to a US strike,'' Postol said. Many Russian
nuclear missiles are either in silos or are collected together in
corrugated steel buildings, making them a possible lucrative target
in a nuclear war. Many US nuclear missiles, in comparison, are on
submarines, which can evade detection.
</P>
<P>
   A US arms control official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said de-alerting would be extremely difficult in practice because
of the difficulty of verification. ``You have to imagine all sorts
of shenanigans there would be over verification,'' the official
said. ``Once you mention the word `verification,' the idea loses
some of its attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some arms control analysts, there seems little reason to
keep so many missiles on high alert a decade after the fall of the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the threat? Does anybody think there is going to be a
bolt-out-of-the-blue attack?'' said Joseph Cirincione, senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a
Washington think tank. ``Does anyone believe that the Russians
would do this for some reason, that they would try to do a
preemptive strike? I think it's just insane at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, the Brookings analyst who has had extensive contacts with
Russian counterparts, said while both the United States and Russia
find a preemptive strike scenario ``bizarre,'' the issue cannot be
totally dismissed because of Russia's rising distrust of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Y2K doomsday scenario, which has been so roundly
dismissed by US officials, was cause for losing sleep, Blair did
not respond reassuringly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you sleep at night? Why should you sleep if nobody
knows? Maybe you need a sleeping pill,'' he said. ``You can hope
and trust that the probability is extremely small. But we certainly
don't know that.''

 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Charles Ponzi did something few other criminals _ not
Al Capone or Jesse James _ could manage: He got his name attached
to his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi, who fleeced Bostonians out of millions in 1920, did not
invent what has come to be known as a Ponzi scheme, a scam in which
early investors are paid with money from new investors. The con had
been around for years, maybe centuries. But Ponzi did it on such a
grand scale, with such flair and in such full view of the world and
the media, that he earned his place in criminal history. ``He was a
celebrity and that only enticed more people into his scheme,'' says
William Galvin, Massachusetts secretary of state, who spends part
of his time trying to protect investors from modern-day Ponzi
imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi may have already been a crook when he left Italy in 1903
at age 20 for America. He participated in scams everywhere from
Providence to Montreal, where he wound up in prison for his
efforts. But Ponzi's ambition was as big as his adopted country. He
knew he was destined to be rich. He just needed the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   For Ponzi, the right idea turned out to be stamps, actually a
type of foreign stamps called International Reply Coupons. Through
some quirk in the laws, the coupons could be purchased overseas for
a penny or two and redeemed in the United States for 6 cents. In
theory, you could buy enough of the stamps to make huge profits. In
practice, Ponzi only needed the stamps for a cover story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was enough truth in the story to bring in the
gullible,'' says Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi set up an office at 27 School St. and created a firm
called the Securities and Exchange Company, a name meant to instill
confidence in potential investors. Then he made his offer:
Investors who bought into the company would get a 50 percent return
on their money in 45 days; a 100 percent return in 90 days. Banks
at the time paid 5 percent interest annually.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were slow at first, but Ponzi had the gift of gab and the
ability to tell people what they wanted to hear. If they were
skeptical, and some were, he could recount in great detail the
story of the stamps and assuage their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As time went on, Ponzi didn't need to do much selling: his
investors became his best sellers. They told friends, relatives,
and co-workers about the investment. If people actually wanted to
get their money back after 45 days, Ponzi was happy to oblige. He
had plenty on hand. In fact, most people chose to reinvest for
another 45 days, hoping for an even bigger score.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi started selling in December of 1919. By the spring he was
rich. He bought fancy suits and took to carrying a cane and a
gold-tipped cigarette holder. He bought an expensive car and hired
a chauffeur. He brought his mother over from Italy and purchased a
huge house in suburban Lexington for his wife, Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there was more money than he could spend. In May 1920,
he took in $442,000, according to biographer Donald Dunn, author of
``Ponzi: The Boston Swindler.'' By the summer he was taking in
$250,000 a day. He stuffed the money into closets and desk drawers.
Who said the streets of America weren't paved with gold? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity was a mixed blessing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi's wealth brought fame and attention from the newspapers,
which wanted to know more about the man with the Midas touch. The
celebrity was a mixed blessing: It attracted new investors but it
also brought scrutiny from law enforcement and hard-nosed
reporters. The Boston Post, smelling a rat, began publishing
skeptical stories about Ponzi, questioning how he could afford to
pay out such outlandish sums.
</P>
<P>
   A Post reporter interviewed Clarence Barron, the founder of the
financial publication, Barron's, who all but declared the Ponzi
plan a fraud. Barron checked with the Boston post office and found
out that hardly any of the International Reply Coupons were
actually being redeemed. ``Why don't the postal operations reflect
Ponzi's, if he truly is dealing in millions of coupons?'' Barron
asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the press wasn't Ponzi's only problem. As he knew better
than anyone, Ponzi schemes start well but end badly. You can rob
Peter to pay Paul, but eventually you run out of Pauls and the
whole thing collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Ponzi needed an exit strategy. At one point, in a very 1990s bit
of thinking, he considered taking his company public and using the
proceeds from the stock sale to pay off his debts. He also
contemplated taking over some local banks and using their money to
pay his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance. The Post, which won a Pulitzer Prize
for its Ponzi coverage, kept after him. Eventually the paper dug up
a prison photograph of Ponzi from Montreal. To add insult to
injury, Ponzi's public relations man deserted him and wrote an
article for the Post that said Ponzi was broke.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal with the state, Ponzi began giving back money to
investors. He gave back more than $3 million. Naturally there
wasn't enough to meet his obligations. When an auditor for the
state tallied up the figures he found that Ponzi had $3 million in
assets and $7 million in liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you are $4 million short,'' the auditor told Ponzi,
who reportedly replied, ``Gee. Then I guess I am not solvent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview just before he surrendered to police, Ponzi was
asked if he wanted to make a statement. The public deserves it,
don't you think? the reporter said. ``The public deserves exactly
what it gets, no more, no less,'' said Ponzi. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Suckers in all shapes and sizes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Spooner agrees. The well-known Boston stockbroker and
author says as long as there are people looking to get rich quick,
Ponzi schemes will thrive. ``P. T. Barnum was right,'' says
Spooner. ``There is a sucker born every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The suckers come in all shapes and sizes and from every social
class. In the 1970s a group of famous entertainers including Liza
Minelli, Andy Williams and Jack Benny lost millions when they
invested in a tax shelter plan that purported to invest in oil. It
turned out there were no oil wells.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy got a
number of financial heavyweights, including John Whitehead, the
chairman of Goldman Sachs and former US Treasury Secretary William
Simon, to contribute $100 million to a charity that promised it
would double donors' donations in six months. The money wound up in
the pocket of the foundation's creator, John Bennett Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Gullibility isn't strictly an American vice. In the mid-1990s
practically everyone in Albania poured money into a series of
Ponzi-style investment plans. By one estimate, $1 billion or 25
percent of the poor nation's gross national product was funneled
into the plans that promised high rates of interest and used new
money to pay off early investors. When angry Albanians found out
they had been duped, they rioted in the streets and threatened to
bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Nestor, one of Galvin's deputies, says there are some
common themes to all Ponzi schemes. They all sound too good to be
true, and they all guarantee high rates of return. In the real
world, says Nestor, there are no guarantees and high rewards only
come with high risk. ``We can regulate until we are blue in the
face,'' says Nestor, ``but if people are not careful they can be
ripped off.''

   Ponzi schemes have precious few winners. The list of losers
often includes the creator. ``Unless you have Whitey Bulger's
travel agent there is no way to get away with one,'' Galvin says.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ponzi didn't get away. He spent more than a decade in
jail. While he was in prison his mother died. When he got out his
wife divorced him and the government deported him to Italy. He died
in the charity ward of a Brazilian hospital in 1949. The last
picture of Ponzi, taken in the hospital, showed him with a big
smile on his face.

   BULGARIA-CLINTON (Sofia, Bulgaria) _ President Clinton offered a
rousing pep talk to the people of Bulgaria Monday night at an
outdoor rally in the same downtown square where democracy advocates
helped overthrow a brutal Communist dictatorship almost exactly 10
years ago. Never before has an American president come to this
ancient land, and the crowd of 10,000 flag-waving people roared
with approval in a celebration that showed just how much has
changed since the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. By Marc Lacey.

   NIGERIA-CORRUPTION (Kano, Nigeria) _ After Friday Prayers,
townsfolk say, Maryam Abacha, the widow of the dictator who ruled
and looted this country for five years, has begun opening the gates
of the family compound to the city's poor, who fill her courtyard
to receive free bags of rice, millet and sorghum. The practice is
regarded here as a crude attempt to burnish the image of the
Abachas, who have become the poster-family of an unexpected and
ambitious drive by the county's new president, Olusegun Obasanjo,
to root out corruption. By Norimitsu Onishi.

But as laws and police have gotten more aggressive, they have
produced a startling side effect: In spots around the country, as

 &HT;    Common digestive disorders: A glossary
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Common digestive woes usually are short-term problems, such as
indigestion, constipation and diarrhea. Chronic symptoms can be a
sign of a more serious disorder. Here are some of the more common
ways your digestive system can leave you singing the tummy blues.
</P>
<P>
   Celiac disease: Also called sprue, it's caused by the protein
gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes oats.
People with it cannot properly absorb food because the lining of
the small intestine is damaged. Often occurs in the first year of
life but can occur at any age. Gas, weight loss, weakness and
fatigue are symptoms in adults.
</P>
<P>
   Constipation: Eat more fiber, drink more water and eat less
highly refined and processed food, such as cheese, doughnuts, and
vending machine food if you want to avoid bouts of constipation.
Wholegrain bread, cereals, fruit, leafy vegetables, beans and
water, water, water will get bowels moving. Too little exercise and
long periods of immobility also affects bowel habits. It can also
be a sign of of a metabolic disorder or trouble with your large
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Diarrhea: Can be a symptom of many disorders, including food
poisoning. Can also be caused by a viral infection, called
gastroenteritis, spread from another person commonly to babies and
young children. Persistent diarrhea and/or bloody stools are signs
of a more serious disorder needing medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Food intolerance: Developing a stomachache each time you eat a
certain kind of food may indicate an intolerance to it. Often it's
an enzyme deficiency, so your body can't properly digest the food.
Lactose intolerance is an example. Inability to digest lactose, the
natural sugar found in milk and dairy products, is a common dietary
problem worldwide and is linked to certain ethnic groups, such as
African-Americans, Native Americans, Asians and Jewish people.
People with lactose intolerance experience stomach bloating,
cramping and diarrhea within a few hours after drinking or eating
milk or dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Food poisoning: Eating food or water that's been contaminated
from various kinds of bacteria is the most common cause of sudden
onset of diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   It can start within hours or days after consumption of the bad
food. There are 250 different kinds of foodborne illnesses that
sicken some 76 million Americans annually, killing 5,000 and and
hospitalizing 325,000 others. People suffering from it often
mistakenly call it stomach flu, but there is no such thing.
Bacterial infections can develop if you eat turkey or other foods
left out on the counter overnight or contaminated vegetables, fruit
or meat. Get to a doctor if diarrhea doesn't stop in 48-72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gastritis: Inflammation of the stomach lining that is usually
chronic. Causes include long-term use of aspirin and
anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, excessive alcohol intake
or infection by H. pylori bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Gastroenteritis: Inflammation of the lining of the stomach and
intestines that's usually due to a bacterial or viral infection.
Symptoms can include diarrhea, vomiting, cramps and fever. It
commonly occurs within families or others in close contact, such as
schoolchildren. If symptoms are severe or prolonged, consult a
doctor. Most people recover rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Gastroesophageal reflux: Also called GER or acid reflux. Most
common cause of indigestion attacks and a burning pain called
heartburn. It's caused by acidic juices from the stomach flowing
back up into the esophagus, which cannot protect itself from the
acid. Acid reflux attacks are usually brief and mild. But if
chronic and persistent, acid reflux can lead to permanent damage
and possible digestive tract bleeding. Pregnancy and obesity are
some GER triggers. Symptoms include heartburn, or burning pain in
the chest behind the breastbone, acidic taste in mouth, persistent
cough, and belching. If the chest pain does not occur after eating,
and spreads up and down an arm, you could be suffering angina or a
heart attack. Seek medical help immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Helicobacter pylori infection: Caused by presence of H. pylori
bacteria, which is found in stomach lining of about half of world's
population. Discovered last decade and replaced the long-time
diagnosis of stomach ulcers being caused by foods and stress. The
bacteria damages the mucus layer that protects the stomach lining
from acidic digestive juices and leads to damage. Causes gastritis,
peptic ulcer and possibly increasing risk of developing stomach
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hernia: Usually occurs in men when heavy lifting or other
triggers cause a part of the intestine to push through a weakened
stomach muscle. Visible bulge develops that can disappear when
lying flat. Can become twisted, causing severe pain and requiring
immediate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Indigestion: What you get when you overindulge, either eating
too much of everything, wolfing down your meal over the kitchen
counter or car dashboard, or from too much alcohol, coffee, rich,
fatty or heavily spiced food. Stress, certain drugs and aspirin can
also cause indigestion. Symptoms are pain or discomfort in upper
abdomen and your stomach feeling ``sour.''
</P>
<P>
   Irritable bowl syndrome: Intermittent abdominal pain with
constipation and/or diarrhea. Commonly develops in 20-30 year-old
age group; twice as common among women. Can cause abdominal
bloating, excessive gas, feeling of fullness and feeling bowel has
not completely emptied. Can be distressing but usually doesn't lead
to serious complications. Symptoms can be resolved with avoiding
large meals, spicy and fried food, reducing caffeine intake, eating
at regular times and using relaxation techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Peptic ulcer: Eroded area of the tissue lining of the stomach or
duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Symptoms include
pain or discomfort in upper abdomen, loss of appetite and weight
loss, feeling of fullness, nausea and sometimes vomiting. Pain
usually worse when stomach is empty. Pain can disappear for weeks
or months and then reappear. Peptic ulcers are either duodenal
ulcers (usually in people in 20-45 age group) or gastric ulcers
(most common in over 50 population.) Gastric ulcers are aggravated
by food. Common complication is bleeding as the ulcer deepens and
strikes nearby blood vessels.

 &HT;    Surviving T-day indegestion
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will probably start with a cheese straw.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a nibble. Not even a mouthful. So negligible that you'll
follow it up with a ham biscuit. And a sausage ball. And some
spiced pecans, a handful of mixed nuts, a couple of marshmallows
filched from the sweet potatoes, a scrap of turkey skin, some loose
crumbs of stuffing ...
</P>
<P>
   Need we go on?
</P>
<P>
   You know how this ends. Four or five hours of unrestricted
grazing later _ more green-bean casserole? why, thank you! _ you're
horizontal and groaning, stunned with carbohydrates, dimly sensing
that first acrid tickle, that uneasy toasty feeling, that growing
apprehension that your stuffed self is boiling over just below your
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Take it as some small comfort that you'll have a lot of company:
By one estimate, almost half of adult Americans experience some
digestive trouble at least once a month. Care to guess which day in
November marks heartburn's high-water mark? Too much food, too much
fat, too much alcohol, too much caffeine _ Thanksgiving practically
qualifies as National Indigestion Day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you already know the easy answer. ``My first advice
would be moderation in the size of the meal and the amount of
alcohol consumed,'' said Dr. J. Patrick Waring, a specialist in
digestive disorders at Emory University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a big meal sets you up for gastric distress.
First, the extra amount you eat distends your stomach. Sensing a
tough task ahead, the stomach produces extra digestive juices. Then
some of the ingredients of your dinner _ alcohol, chocolate, fatty
foods _ relax the muscles that close off the junction between
stomach and esophagus. Stomach acid splashes through that portal,
searing the delicate tissues on the other side: in medical
terminology, gastroesophageal reflux disease.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as heartburn. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Indigestion isn't only heartburn. Underlying medical conditions
can also provoke digestive trouble:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Unrecognized ulcers can cause discomfort in the upper abdomen,
usually linked to eating.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lactose intolerance _ inability to digest a natural sugar in
milk _ produces gas and bloating.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gastritis, an irritation of the stomach lining from
painkillers or bacteria, can cause pain and gastric bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Food poisoning, from bacterial contamination, is distinctive:
sharp cramping, nausea, diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And the early signs of a heart attack _ sweaty discomfort,
restlessness, pain in the chest or high in the abdomen _ can mimic
indigestion as well.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant proportion of the digestive trouble afflicting
the nation on Thursday is likely to be uncomplicated heartburn. The
remedies are uncomplicated as well.
</P>
<P>
   First, don't eat too much.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``If you have occasional trouble already, and you know
you'll be eating something that will bother you, take an
over-the-counter medication,'' Waring said. ``If you take them
before the meal, they decrease acid production and discomfort after
the meal. They really do work.''
</P>
<P>
   If you skipped a pharmaceutical first course and trouble
develops, the third line of defense is a commercial antacid.
``Maalox, Mylanta, Gaviscon, Tums, Rolaids _ they'll all help
neutralize acid in the stomach,'' Waring said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you know you have a food allergy, don't hold up the
buffet line deciding what's less risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of time figuring out which food to avoid,
but if they just avoided overeating that would probably help as
much as figuring out what to stay away from,'' Waring added.
</P>
<P>
   So put down the cheese straw and back away quietly. We don't
want things to get ugly here.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS APLENTY
</P>
<P>
   A smorgasbord of medical options await those who overindulge on
Thanksgiving. Over-the-counter medications break down into four
categories:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Antacids
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Food enzymes
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Histamine 2 receptor antagonists
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Antiflatulents.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Pepto-Bismol, have been around for decades and work
by diluting stomach acid. Newer ones , like the histamine 2
receptor antagonists, work by stopping the problem at the
biological source _ Pepcid AC, Tagamet and Zantac work by reducing
the production of stomach acid.

   Second, ``If you have occasional trouble already, and you know
you'll be eating something that will bother you, take an
over-the-counter medication,'' Waring said. ``If you take them
before the meal, they decrease acid production and discomfort after
the meal. They really do work.''
</P>
<P>
   If you skipped a pharmaceutical first course and trouble
develops, the third line of defense is a commercial antacid.
``Maalox, Mylanta, Gaviscon, Tums, Rolaids _ they'll all help
neutralize acid in the stomach,'' Waring said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you know you have a food allergy, don't hold up the
buffet line deciding what's less risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of time figuring out which food to avoid,
but if they just avoided overeating that would probably help as
much as figuring out what to stay away from,'' Waring added.
</P>
<P>
   So put down the cheese straw and back away quietly. We don't
want things to get ugly here.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS APLENTY
</P>
<P>
   A smorgasbord of medical options await those who overindulge on
Thanksgiving. Over-the-counter medications break down into four
categories:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Antacids
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Food enzymes
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Histamine 2 receptor antagonists
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Antiflatulents.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Pepto-Bismol, have been around for decades and work
by diluting stomach acid. Newer ones , like the histamine 2
receptor antagonists, work by stopping the problem at the
biological source _ Pepcid AC, Tagamet and Zantac work by reducing
the production of stomach acid.

 &HT;    Tips on coping with the glut of leftovers post-feast excess
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taste buds are fickle, easily bored little rascals. What was
anticipated and exciting one day quickly becomes tired and humdrum
to them in no time at all.
</P>
<P>
   Leftovers are, well, they're left over, and as any cook knows,
it takes a bit of effort to get those taste buds' attention in a
meal made from yesterday's feast. Once turkey and ham sandwiches
have made the rounds, recycling an intriguing meal out of leftovers
is indeed a challenge, but it's one that can be met creatively with
a little research time.
</P>
<P>
   The Larousse Gastronomique, which bills itself as the ``World's
Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia,'' says, ``the art of using up
leftovers is not to be considered as the summit of culinary
achievement.'' Still, a host of contributors to the Internet
disagree and provide terrific recipes and ideas that may even rival
the original dish.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some hints, sites and recipes we gathered from the Web
that my help you avoid hearing the dreaded, ``Turkey? Not again!''
</P>
<P>
   SOME HINTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add an unexpected spice or ingredient that will completely
change the taste and character of the original dish. Seek out
ethnic recipes that use spices like curry, cumin and chili powder
to transform the texture and taste into something new.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think cheese. Various cheeses used as fondue and in pizzas and
casseroles can do wonders to change the character of a leftover. A
bubbling casserole that alternates layers of leftover meats and
vegetables with Gruyere or another cheese is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Salads. Cube or julienne that turkey, ham or roast and use it
in a salad. Don't be afraid to use fruit and try a dressing you've
never used before for something new.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stir-fry. This is a good way to use a multitude of leftovers.
Don't forget to add something new and serve over pasta or rice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Breakfast. Think omelets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fritters and cakes. Dip broccoli or cauliflower florets into
batter and then deep-fry. Add minced onion and other ingredients to
leftover mashed potatoes and fry until golden.
</P>
<P>
   RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mr. Food at www.homearts.com/mrfood/articles/c8left11.htm
offers more than 50 inventive ways to redesign all the holiday
leftovers crowding your refrigerator. A pull-down menu lets you
restyle turkey, ham, roast beef, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes,
stuffing and even goose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hearty Navaho Chili and creamy Turkey Fettuccine are two of
the recipes for leftovers offered by the Canadian Press at
www.canoe.ca
</P>
<P>
   /CNEWSLifeArchive/981229dollar2.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shopper News at www.shoppernews.com/c040694.html offers
recipes that transform leftover turkey, ham and lamb into rivals of
the originals, such as Asparagus Ham Lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At the ``Land of Leftovers,'' www.seasoned.com/issues/199903
</P>
<P>
   /c.ll.p1.html, you'll find new twists using all kinds of
leftovers from fish to fowl and all kinds of vegetables in that
trusty old standard for leftovers, the potpie. Recipes include
Simple Fish Pie; Chicken, Leek and Parsley Pie; Farmhouse Pie; and
Corn and Bean Tamale Pie. To avoid monotony, use crusts ranging
from traditional pie pastry to bread crumbs to potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you are interested in making a turkey pizza, check the
recipe at

<P>
   www.wral-tv.com/features/remakes/1998
</P>
<P>
   /0303-turkey-pizza/.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If it's back to work the day after and you're looking for
quick and simple ways to recycle turkey, see the six easy recipes
at www.canturkey.ca/lefovers.htm. The list includes Turkey
Bruschetta, where you brush slices of Italian bread with olive oil,
top with minced garlic and toast in the oven, then spoon on a
combination of turkey, shredded mozzarella cheese and chopped fresh
basil and broil just until the cheese melts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Turkey Grape Salad, combining halved green grapes,
toasted sliced almonds, sliced green onions, orange zest and light
mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Turkey Stir Fry, Turkey and Spinach Tetrazzini
and others to make in a flash.

 &HT;    Rest assured there's still time to shine
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The time-crunched Pilgrims among us still have time to prepare a
nice Thanksgiving meal. Just take a tour of the grocery freezer
case, the deli or the local bakery for a few shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to cook but won't have much time, we offer
the No-Stress Thanksgiving Menu _ simple recipes you prepare but
that take advantage of the best convenience products.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to cook (but you forgot to make a
restaurant reservation) look at our suggestions for a Heat-and-Eat
Thanksgiving. We sampled a few prepared products that together
would make a simple, satisfying traditional meal. Or you may want
to pluck a couple of the products to round out your menu or take
care of any last-minute cancellations.

</P>
<P>
   COUNTDOWN
</P>
<P>
   While others may have slaved for weeks, you'll be able to put a
nice meal on the table in a matter of hours. And the beauty of it _
the only chopping here is quartering potatoes. Here's a general
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   (Monday)Today: Order turkey or any other deli items, such as
dressing or pie.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday/Wednesday: Pick up groceries and pre-ordered items.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night: Marinate turkey breast. If desired, make the
cranberry salad and the carrot and orange salad and keep
refrigerated. You could also bake the pies this evening or bake
them while the meal is being served on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: The best way to break down the cooking duties is by
source of heat.
</P>
<P>
   In the oven: the turkey breast, the sweet potatoes, the rolls
and the pie. Total oven time is 5 to 5 1/2 hours (which can be cut
by 1 to 1 1/2 hours by cooking the pies the night before). Start
with the turkey. You can probably get by with putting the sweet
potatoes in at the same time, but that will increase cooking time
for both dishes. Once they are done, the rolls go in. Then bake (or
reheat pies if desired) while dinner is being served, but remember
to set a timer.
</P>
<P>
   On the stovetop: the sausage and wild rice dressing, the
red-skin mashed potatoes and the maple glazed pearl onions. I'd
start with cooking the sausage and rice (some rice boxes give
microwave directions), and then combining to make the dressing.
Then make the pearl onions. Do the mashed potatoes last.
</P>
<P>
   In the microwave: the spinach for the creamed herbed spinach.
Once cooked, simply blend with the cheeses. Good for reheating
dishes made early, such as the wild rice dressing.
</P>
<P>
   No cook: the cranberry salad and the carrot and orange salad.
You can simplify things by making these the night before, but there
should be plenty of time to throw them together on Thursday as
well.

   Even boneless turkey breast takes time to thaw, so be sure to
buy yours a day and a half in advance. We think you'll find this so
simple and delicious it will visit your table again before next
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   1 whole boneless turkey breast, with skin on (about 3 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   Ground ginger; fresh minced garlic, or granulated garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup apricot preserves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup light soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   The night before (or at least 2 hours before roasting): Season
both sides of the turkey breast well with ground ginger and garlic.
Put in a roasting pan. Combine the apricot preserves, mustard and
soy sauce. Blend well; cover breast, top and bottom of turkey with
the sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to
roast.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Remove turkey from refrigerator and
add 1/4 cup water to the roasting pan. Bake uncovered for 2 1/2
hours (or until a meat thermometer registers 170 degrees), basting
occasionally with gravy in pan. Allow to stand for at least 10
minutes before slicing. _ Adapted from: ``Grandma Doralee

   If you find yourself without time to crumble and chop a
traditional Southern corn bread dressing, try this alternative. The
sausage makes this a spicy, savory sidekick for a bird.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dried sour cherries or cranberries
</P>

sausage, water chestnuts and cherries or cranberries. Transfer to
an oven-to-table casserole. This can be prepared in advance and
reheated in the microwave.

   Bonnie Tandy LeBlang, author of the nationally syndicated column
Express Lane Cooking, makes this with fresh sweet potatoes. To
simplify the process we tried it with canned (we used Glory Foods
brand) and thought it was delicious. Undoubtedly, fresh would be
even better if you have the time. Here's how to do it: Peel and
slice 3 pounds sweet potatoes in 1/2-inch rounds; arrange in a
single layer in a roasting pan sprayed with nonstick spray, cover
with apple juice mixture; cover with foil and bake 30 minutes.
Remove foil, turn the potatoes and continue to bake 15-20 minutes
or until potatoes are tender. Transfer mixture to an ovenproof
casserole dish. Add marshmallows and bake 15-20 minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   3 (15-ounce) cans sweet potatoes, drained
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 (6-ounce) can apple juice concentrate, defrosted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 (10-ounce) bag marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut sweet potato chunks in 2-inch
slices; arrange in a shallow ovenproof casserole dish sprayed with
vegetable spray. Stir the ginger into the apple juice concentrate,
then pour over the slices. Cover with foil and bake about 15
minutes. Remove the cover, turn the potatoes and continue to cook
about 15 minutes. (Don't worry if it isn't very attractive; the
marshmallows will hide it.) Top with marshmallows and bake 15-20
minutes longer, until marshmallows are nicely browned.

   There really is no good substitute for homemade mashed potatoes.
But to save time, go the rustic route. Simply scrub small red
potatoes, quarter, boil and mash, leaving the skins on.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 to 3 pounds small red-skin potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Scrub potatoes thoroughly and quarter them. Put them in a
3-quart saucepan and cover with water. Place pan over medium-high
heat and boil potatoes until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Drain
and return to pot. Pour in buttermilk and add the butter. Beat on
low speed with a hand-held mixer (or use a potato masher) until
desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.

   It's hard to get any easier than this. The herbed soft cheese
delivers just the right touch. Even the most finicky will find this
spinach delicious. After the holidays, make this a weeknight
standard.
</P>
<P>
   2 boxes (10 ounces each) frozen spinach, or 2 bags (10 ounces
each) cleaned fresh spinach
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup soft garlic and herb cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to cook spinach, either frozen or fresh, is in a
microwave. If frozen, place the box right in the microwave and cook
on high power for 5 minutes. If fresh, poke 2 holes in a bag of
spinach and microwave on high power for 4 minutes. (If you don't
have a microwave, cook fresh or frozen spinach in a large saucepan
with about 1/2 inch water until soft. This will take about 8
minutes for frozen and 3 to 4 minutes for fresh.) When the spinach
is cooked, drain in a strainer, pushing out as much water as
possible. Toss the hot spinach with the cream cheese and grated
Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. _ From: ``Cooking

   Mincemeat is one of those holiday traditions that knows no
middle ground; you either love it or you hate it. Before you assume
you fall into the latter category, try this version _ in which the
tartness of cranberries balances the spicy sweetness of the
dried-fruit mixture.
</P>
<P>
   1 (27-ounce) jar of mincemeat (we used Borden's Nonesuch)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups fresh whole cranberries (if frozen, do not thaw)

   1 egg yolk, mixed with 1 tablespoon water

<P>
   Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   Place rack in lower half of oven; preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In a large bowl, stir together the mincemeat and the cranberries.
Set aside. Line a 9-inch pie plate with one crust; add filling and
cover with top crust; cut slits near the center. Seal and flute
edges. Brush surface of pie with egg wash. Bake 30 minutes. (May be
baked early in the day and left at room temperature; or bake the
night before, cover and refrigerate; reheat in 350-degree oven just
until heated through.)

 &HT;    ANESTHESIOLOGISTS CALL FOR CONGRESSIONAL PROBE OF NAVY
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American Society of Anesthesiologists Monday
called for a congressional investigation of plans to permit
unsupervised nurses to administer anesthesia at the National Naval
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The chief anesthesiologist at the Bethesda, Md., hospital was
relieved of his command two weeks ago for refusing to obey an order
that he authorize certified registered nurse anethetists (CRNAs) to
give patients the sleep-inducing and pain-blocking drugs without
physician supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Dr. Alvin Manaaysay, a Navy captain, was
announced at a staff meeting Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Bonnie Potter, commander of the hospital, confirmed
that she had issued the order that CRNAs be authorized to
administer the drugs to certain patients. However, she denied that
the substances would be given to high government officials only
under physician supervision, regardless of a patient's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other hospitals, it is a physician who determines if a
patient is fit to undergo surgery,'' said Dr. Ronald MacKenzie, an
anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and
president of the anestheologists group. ``It is unconscionable that
they would expect someone with only nursing training to make a
medical decision.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie's request for a congressional inquiry was contained in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, aides said Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., had spoken to
members of the House Armed Services Committee about investigating
the policy change at Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men and women who put their lives on the line each day to
defend our freedom have a right to the best medical care
available,'' Weldon, a former Army physician, was quoted as saying.
``If there is a change of this magnitude, it should be subject to
full congressional review.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter said in a written statement that the Navy medical system
already had a policy under which anesthesia is provided to healthy
adults and children more than 24 months old by unsupervised CRNAs.
</P>
<P>
   The change she directed at Bethesda would bring the hospital,
where presidents and members of Congress often receive medical
care, in line with Navy policy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists said
the specially trained nurses are fully qualified to administer the
drugs _ and do so frequently in civilian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Beauregard, a former Bethesda anesthesiologist now in
private practice in Washington, said his former colleagues at the
hospital told him that when Potter was asked what the policy would
be with dignitaries, she replied they would continue to receive the
drugs only under physician supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not condone, nor have I ever directed my staff to deliver
a different level of care based on a patient's so-called VIP
status,'' Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Army Medical Command has confirmed that
the Army is considering changing its policy to authorize
unsupervised use of the drugs by CRNAs but added that no decision
has been made.

 &HT;    For many, oysters vital to dressing
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cynthia Montgomery of Tucker, Ga., had some oyster
dressing at a friend's home in Tennessee years ago and wrote to us
this fall seeking a recipe for the holidays. All she could tell us
about it was that it includes bread, not corn bread.
</P>
<P>
   We got a bushel of ideas from readers, including this
traditional recipe from Dorothy Welch of Snellville, Ga. She said
it's a recipe her mother used in Ohio for Thanksgiving and
Christmas dinners, and now she continues the tradition for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   A similar recipe from Liz Bowerman adds 2 tablespoons grated
lemon peel and 1 tablespoon dry sage.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Harper sent a recipe she used to use that includes 1/2
teaspoon nutmeg and some lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very good, but I haven't made it in several years as I
found my love for oysters quite exceeded the rest of the family's
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   If enough folks who will be around your table like oysters, we
expect they'll thank you if you make this one.

 &HT;    Procrastinators, take heart: You can still put out a magnificent
spread this Thursday even if you haven't yet done a thing
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK. We know you are out there. You think planning is stifling
and looking a week ahead on the calendar a waste of the precious
now.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But peek ahead about three days. That's right, it's
Thanksgiving. Remember? Your parents called from Florida last week
and said they'd be at your place by noon. And they are bringing
Aunt Edna and Cousin Tim with them.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now take a deep breath. It will be OK. The frosty cranberry
mold that needs to freeze for a week is out. So is a 25-pound
frozen turkey. Not enough time to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   But order a fresh or precooked turkey today, hit the grocery
tomorrow or Wednesday and on Thursday you can serve a Thanksgiving
meal that will give the illusion of weeks of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why start a month in advance? It's not brain surgery,'' says
Bonnie Tandy Leblang, co-author of Supermarket Sampler and author
of Express Lane Cooking, two nationally syndicated columns. ``I
don't even think of starting until Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a sudden illness sidelined travel plans one
Thanksgiving, so LeBlang dashed to a grocery store that morning and
pulled off the traditional meal in only 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   She warmed thick slices of turkey bought from the deli section;
made gravy from stock she had in the freezer; created stuffing from
bread crumbs, onions and celery; poured cranberry sauce from a can;
mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed green beans. While she and her
kids were feasting, Leblang popped a Mrs. Smith's apple pie in the
oven.
</P>
<P>
   So you see, there's plenty of time to have a delectable
celebration on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial item of business for today is to locate a turkey.
Whether you are looking for a fresh turkey to roast or a precooked
bird, start with phone detective work. Call grocery stores,
restaurants or caterers to see what might still be available _ at
some places, the deadline for ordering turkey has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Walker, a ``hambassador'' for the Honeybaked Ham Co., said
most stores will have pre-cooked turkey through Wednesday, but it's
better to call ahead than walk in. The same is true for many
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bird is taken care of, the rest of the meal is waiting
in the local grocery. Really. ``The trick is to take advantage of
what's good in the grocery store,'' says Leblang.
</P>
<P>
   And the other guideline, Leblang said, is ``to do exactly what
you are comfortable with and don't feel guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the traditional Thanksgiving dishes, there are easy
and easier options. For sweet potatoes, you can buy fresh,
partially cooked or canned and take it from there, whether you are
going for whipped, candied or a casserole, Leblang said.
</P>
<P>
   And while she doesn't make a practice of buying prepared dishes,
we found the Glory Foods candied sweet potatoes (in the frozen
foods section) to be quite good. Bake them, turn them into a bowl,
toss with some chopped pecans and no one will complain. Trust us.
</P>
<P>
   For some popular Thanksgiving fare, frozen foods can be
timesavers. Leblang offers a recipe for maple glazed pearl onions
(see K7) that ``is ideal'' for frozen pearl onions, which saves
peeling-and-blanching time.
</P>
<P>
   And home cooks who are intimidated by baking can easily find
alternatives. ``Mrs. Smith's isn't atrocious and neither is the
corner bakery,'' says Leblang.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to do is add a little touch of love, like topping a
commercial pumpkin pie with a streusel or putting the slices on
dessert plates and drizzling with a little caramel sauce from a
jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember to appeal to all the senses,'' says Hambassador
Walker. Simmer cinnamon and cloves in water on the stovetop to fill
the house with a spicy aroma. Transfer all purchased items to your
own serving dishes and garnish with parsley, sage or whole
cranberries to ``make it visually appealing and appear to be
homemade.''
</P>
<P>
   For a last-minute centerpiece, Walker suggests artfully stacking
fruits such as apples, pears, lemons and limes on a platter and
surrounding with white votive candles.

MAD AT MCCAIN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _The better Arizona Sen. John McCain does with the
voters, the worse he does with several of his Republican Senate
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   A smear campaign against him spread by GOP insiders, many of
whom support his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, burst into the
open recently when author and political analyst Elizabeth Drew not
only described what they were up to but named names. She fingered
four senators, who promptly denied playing such dirty pool.
</P>
<P>
   This columnist cannot personally confirm who is whispering what
to whom. But it is no secret that many of McCain's fellow
Republicans cannot stand him. That is a matter of public record.
</P>
<P>
   Should it make any difference whether senators who deal with him
daily and know him best have taken a dislike to him? No, no, a
thousand times no. The public, not a small club of wheeler-dealers
on Capitol Hill, has the right to decide who is best qualified to
lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the path to peer group affection is to follow the
basic rule that to get along, you must go along. All for one and
one for all, that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is too independent to fit that mold.
</P>
<P>
   But is that characteristic a badge of honor or a sign of being
out of step?
</P>
<P>
   The gripes against McCain are many. He has a sharp tongue and an
explosive temper, not cuddly personality traits. His crusade for
campaign finance reform irritates candidates who depend on lavish
contributions for re-election, and his repeated charges that the
money makes politicians corrupt particularly galls them.
</P>
<P>
   But the really appalling aspect of the current underground
anti-McCain campaign is the implication that his temper reflects an
unstable personality, dangerously unbalanced by the years of
torture as a Vietnam prisoner of war. The strategy is deliberately
designed to turn his appealing image as a genuine military hero
into a political liability. To counter the rumors, McCain has
promised to release his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that politics is a rough sport. But this goes too
far and could easily backfire. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., also a
Vietnam veteran, struck a sympathetic chord when he denounced the
accusations as ``insulting'' to everyhing McCain stands for in the
public mind.
</P>
<P>
   There is no public evidence that McCain is nutty, and in fact
his successful career indicates just the opposite. He is popular in
most opinion polls, if not with his colleagues, and is now
virtually running even with Bush in New Hampshire, which holds the
first 2000 primary.
</P>
<P>
   His foes will no doubt try to provoke him into getting angry
while the cameras are around. But a flash of temper need not be
politically damaging. Every recent president _ every single one _
has been grouchy from time to time, usually with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Anger, properly controlled, can be an appropriate tool of
leadership. It certainly lets everyone know when the boss feels
strongly about an issue.
</P>
<P>
   And a campaign for president requires skills different from
those most useful in the Senate. Many sitting senators have sought
the White House, but none has succeeded since John F. Kennedy did
narrowly in 1960. Kennedy's campaign was no more popular with his
peers than is McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democratic senators viewed Kennedy as a lightweight and
preferred the chamber's seasoned majority leader, Lyndon Johnson,
who was masterful at manipulating policy behind the scenes but
never won enough public support to mount a serious presidential
campaign. (As vice president in 1963, he became president on
Kennedy's death and was elected in his own right in 1964.)
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, the potential for trouble in McCain's
strained relations with other Republican senators. If he were to be
elected president, he would have to learn to get along with them if
he expected to pass much legislation. Perhaps everyone would let
bygones be bygones and get on with the nation's business. Perhaps
not.

TOURING ROCKWELL EXHIBIT STIRS MEMORIES OF GRANPA, CHILDHOOD
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by BC-ROCKWELL-BOX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell was my gran'pa's hero, and so he was mine. Back
then, when I was 7 or 8 or 9, I knew that Mr. Rockwell, Gran'pa
Harry and I were connected in some way. Gran'pa drew cartoons for
the newspaper, and painted and wrote poetry, and I was sure Gran'pa
talked to Mr. Rockwell all the time in secret, and that some day
Mr. Rockwell would come to Wichita, Kansas, and the big house on
Poplar Street.
</P>
<P>
   They'd show me how to paint, and we'd all smoke our pipes (both
of them smoked pipes, so I was sure all artists smoked pipes), and
tell stories, and Grandma would make dinner, and we'd all sit
around, three pals.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. I was probably 9 and our family drove in from
Michigan for Thanksgiving. We all sat around the table while
Grandma brought out the turkey; she sat it down on the table, we
all ooohed and aaahed and Gran'pa cut it, and I watched the first
piece make its way down to me. There was mashed potatoes and gravy
and pie and I sat right next to Gran'pa and he smiled at me.
Everything was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner I began going through a book of Rockwell's
paintings and ``Post'' covers and stopped, dumbfounded and
delighted. There, on the page, was the Thanksgiving I had just had
_ Grandma and the turkey, Gran'pa behind her, all of us watching
the big bird's final descent _ everyone smiling, the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   I had just been IN one of Mr. Rockwell's paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gran'pa, look, it's our Thanksgiving! Look! That lady looks
just like Grandma! That's the turkey! How did Mr. Rockwell know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rockwell knows everyone, Davy.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, in Atlanta, I stood, and I waited, and
finally the old couple to my left walked into the next room, and
for a moment I was alone with Rockwell's ``Freedom From Want.''
</P>
<P>
   I had hoped to see ``Want'' _ and all of Rockwell's paintings _
for 30 years, ever since I had sat next to my grandfather and we
looked at those covers of ``The Saturday Evening Post'' that he had
saved, covers that established Rockwell as the most famous
chronicler of America through the first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the more than 70 oil paintings and all 322 ``Post''
covers that make up the bulk of ``Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the
American People,'' I can't help but think back to that remark he
made after that Thanksgiving dinner. The exhibit is the largest
collection of Rockwell's work that has ever gone on tour. After its
run at Atlanta's High Museum of Art, it will go to six other
museums through February 2002: Chicago Historical Society in
Chicago; The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; the San
Diego Museum of Art in San Diego; the Phoenix Art Museum in
Phoenix, Ariz.; The Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge, Mass.;
and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To view ``Pictures'' is to understand the depth of Rockwell's
love of America, just what a masterful artist and storyteller he
was, and how much hope he had for the country coming through all
the changes and challenges he saw during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell was a believer. He believed America was the
greatest place on earth, he believed in different generations being
comfortable with each other. He thought America was changing for
the better, that children were inherently wonderful, that couples
should grow old together. He maintained that racists were idiots,
that men should fight for their country but would come home safe
and sound and loved. He believed in Thanksgiving and Christmas. He
believed, very strongly, in puppy dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Rockwell had done his first ``Post''
cover in 1916; the magazine began regularly featuring him in 1920.
His idea, he once said, was to chronicle American life ``as I would
like it to be.'' That meant a pubescent girl looking in the mirror
and comparing herself to a movie star in a magazine, gossip
spreading from one person to another, a family walking to church on
Sunday morning, a tot discovering his father's Santa Claus costume,
an older woman and a boy praying in a crowded downtown restaurant,
and hundreds more. A sizable number of his works _ ``Girl at
Mirror,'' ``Going and Coming'' and certainly ``The Four Freedoms''
series _ became the shared visual shorthand of events great and
small to several generations of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell had come along at just the right time to do this, and
he had just the right background and influences. For most of his
time on the ``Post,'' the magazine was one of the two most popular
in America. Along with circuses, baseball games and the radio, the
``Post'' was family entertainment for thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rockwell never thought art and commerce were strange (or
inappropriate) bedfellows. He was a commercial advertising artist
both before and during his ``Post'' career, doing ads for Jell-O,
Sun-Maid Raisins, Ford automobiles, and many more. The images that
often sell products the best are those of home and family,
generations interacting, and a sense of safety and community _
Rockwell believed in all this, but he also knew how effective those
images were.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   He had come to the table, too, with a fondness for American and
English literature from the 1800s, material familiar to much of his
audience. He would do paintings and illustrations based on stories,
books and scenes from Mark Twain, Washington Irving and Charles
Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was informed by his love of the classics, including
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel and the Dutch masters Vermeer and
Rembrandt. One of his most famous paintings, 1943's ``Rosie the
Riveter,'' shows a young red-headed woman in front of an American
flag. She is looking to her right; in her left hand is a sandwich.
Her left arm rests on her right hand, which is on her rivet gun.
The painting is a direct quote from Michelangelo's depiction of the
prophet Isaiah on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps his biggest classic influence was Johannes Vermeer
(1632-1675). Vermeer's placement of characters in a scene and the
simple grace with which he portrayed people doing common tasks and
having common conversations is all over Rockwell's work, as is his
use of light. Like Vermeer, Rockwell's paintings were often
suffused with a soft, golden light, almost a benign presence.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly true of ``Want,'' as well as ``Shuffleton's
Barbershop'' (1950), ``Charwomen in Theater'' (1946) and 1955's
gorgeous ``The Marriage License.'' The last is one of Rockwell's
great quiet triumphs: An everyday scene _ a young couple signing a
marriage license at city hall _ is given a serene and almost
religious significance by the light streaming in the window and
onto the woman's face.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer's light. Smalltown life. Old folks and little boys. A
kid in his only suit leaving the farm for college and a
working-class man speaking up at a town hall meeting. This was
Rockwell's sensibility, and the reason so many people loved him: We
saw ourselves in his work, saw our lives and foibles, with
reference points to the past all along the way.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Gran'pa's room was a magical place _ he had a collection of
pipes from all over the world, an ashtray that looked like a
rattlesnake, a skull, a German rifle and bayonet, a sword from the
War of 1812, Confederate money, weathered paperbacks by Damon
Runyon and Ring Lardner.
</P>
<P>
   I read those books, and dreamed of writing my own _ more likely
than being a painter, as I could barely draw a stick figure. I
watched Gran'pa smoke and draw his cartoons and paint his Christmas
cards. He drew a forest and told me to find the hide-behinds _
impossible, as hide-behinds were never seen at all because they
were so good at hiding behind the trees and the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   There were always old issues of the ``Post'' around, and I would
ask him about them. Who is Rosie the Riveter? Why was she wearing
men's clothes? And he would tell me.
</P>
<P>
   One day I was looking through the book of Mr. Rockwell's
paintings and I came to one I had wondered about before. It showed
a little girl walking with two men in front of her and two men
behind. She was black and they were white, but you couldn't see
their heads, and there were three Ks drawn together on the wall. I
also noticed that someone had thrown a tomato and it had hit the
wall and splattered.
</P>
<P>
   Who was this little girl? Where was she walking? Why were these
men around her? Who threw the tomato? What did KKK mean? And that
other word on the wall, the one that began with an ``n''? What did
that mean?
</P>
<P>
   So he told me _ about people throwing tomatoes at black children
because they didn't want them in their schools, about the days when
people were sold as slaves, about the KKK and their foolishness and
that, no matter what anyone says, nobody is better or worse because
of their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   I knew a little of this, but not most of it. I grew up in
all-white suburban Detroit, where the only black people were
athletes or Motown singers on TV. Friends of mine (or, more often,
fathers of my friends) used that ugly n-word, but Gran'pa said they
were stupid, and liars to boot, and so they were. It just didn't
make any sense _ not liking someone because they looked different.
</P>
<P>
   But who WERE black people? Soon after I found a copy of Sammy
Davis Jr.'s ``Yes I Can'' in my parents' basement and began reading
it. And then came books by Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter and Dick
Gregory, and after that, records by Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson
and Otis Redding and a lifetime of loving blues and jazz and soul
and gospel music. All that started with one Rockwell painting and
the voice of Gran'pa.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``The Problem We All Live With,'' is from 1964,
and it illustrates Rockwell's greatest strength: His ability to
portray change in America in a positive light, his conviction that
the country would grow stronger through those changes, one
generation helping the next.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '20s and '30s, Rockwell's paintings and covers were
usually of rural life. But in the '40s and '50s all that changed:
His viewpoint was now filtered through scenes of the city,
reflecting the move many Americans made from the farm or the small
town to the metropolis during those years.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, 1947's ``Going and Coming,'' the split-screen
image of a family going to and returning from a trip. In the top
half, it is bright morning: The kids are so hyper they almost leap
out of the car, the dog sticks its head out the window; a big day
is clearly in the offing. In the bottom half, the day is nearly
done, if it is in fact the same day, and the trip is over. Everyone
is exhausted. Dad slumps in the front seat; mom's dozing, little
sister is bored, little brother is asleep in the back. Only Grandma
has not changed expression or posture.
</P>
<P>
   A cute scene? Yes. But also emblematic of an era when more and
more families had the time, the car and the disposable income to
venture out on longer vacations than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell could portray change with an undercurrent of fear. This
is clearly evident in ``Problem,'' which shows both the struggle of
the civil rights movement and its triumph: Whatever the little girl
has to walk through, she will go to school.
</P>
<P>
   He could also be ambivalent about change, wary of it. Notice the
slightly threadbare look of the neighborhood the family walks
through in 1953's ``Walking to Church.'' Or how the church steeple
is lower than the antenna in 1949's ``New Television Antenna.'' In
these works, Rockwell asks if the city really is preferable to the
country, and if we're not replacing our faith in God with our faith
in man-made entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But all three paintings make clear his confidence that different
generations would be together to face whatever was ahead. The bond
would be stretched, but would not break.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Four Freedoms'' series, though, is about nothing changing
at all, even as the world is in chaos. The four paintings _
``Freedom From Want,'' ``Freedom of Speech,'' ``Freedom to
Worship'' and ``Freedom From Fear'' _ use Rockwell's language of
everyday America (and that gorgeous light!) to show us the very
essence of what the country had and stood to lose during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union
address, they brilliantly make the personal the universal. And
nowhere is this more true than in ``Want'': Notice, in the lower
right-hand corner, the man looking out right at you, eyebrows
raised. Those eyes invite us in, make us members of the family,
tell us that this is our home, our table. In this world, mothers
can tuck their children in bed, and a man can speak his mind, and
we can worship as we choose. And we can gather, old and young, and
celebrate ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1943, the paintings toured America. More than 1 million
people viewed them, $132 million in war bonds were sold, as well as
4 million posters. The paintings became synonymous with the
country's independence and hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I knew none of this three decades ago. The paintings, and many
of Rockwell's other works, simply touched a nerve in me. They were
a way of looking back through time to eras I had heard about,
complete stories, complete lives there on canvas, and a reassurance
that everything would work out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   For a kid obsessed with history and in love with his Gran'pa,
they were heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Ferman, gentleman, longtime editorial cartoonist for the
``Wichita Beacon,'' and collector of wondrous things, died in April
1973. I was 10, and one of the last things he told me was that if I
decided to become a newspaperman I would make no money whatsoever,
so don't, for Pete's sake, complain about it.
</P>
<P>
   The old house in Wichita now belongs to someone else, I have
never smoked a pipe, and I still cannot draw anything more
demanding than a stick figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom From Want'' has been parodied over and over in
publications from ``The New York Observer'' to ``The Nation,'' as
well as the video rental box for a horrible English film called
``Eat the Rich.'' In the past decade the grandmother has been
depicted as Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Still ``Want'' speaks to me _ of that Thanksgiving meal, of
those long afternoons in that magical room, of the hide-behinds and
the smell of pipe smoke, of the world I found in those dusty,
dog-eared magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end ``Want'' tells me that America has far more
goodness in it than we often give it credit for. And that in a way
that we may never truly understand and all too rarely acknowledge,
we are all in this together _ the little girl walking to school,
the family on vacation, the couple in the coffee shop after the
prom, all the rest.

   Norman Rockwell portrayed small-town life in no small part
because he lived small-town life _ and that means that those
wanting to see the majority of his work have to venture to the
Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., near the
Massachusetts-New York border.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why ``Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American
People'' is touring America for the next several years. The largest
traveling Rockwell exhibit ever, ``Pictures'' is also the first
retrospective of all his major works to hit the road since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know everybody can't get to Stockbridge,'' says Maureen
Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the Rockwell Museum. ``We knew
everybody had their favorites, and we felt it was important to
include them in this collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will be at Atlanta's High Museum of Art through
Jan. 30, 2000.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous storm system that brought snow to parts of the
central Rockies and western Plains on Monday will move quickly
northeast toward the western Great Lakes on Tuesday. A swath of
rain will occur from northern Missouri to the central Great Lakes.
A few thunderstorms will be embedded in the rain, particularly from
the central Mississippi Valley to the southwestern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, several inches of snow may accumulate over extreme
eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota as cold air is drawn
into the circulation of the storm. Rain will mix with snow Tuesday
afternoon from eastern Minnesota to the northwestern Great Lakes
states.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of thundershowers will precede a cold front as it
sweeps into the Mississippi Valley. A surge of very moist air a few
thousand feet above the ground will contribute to causing isolated
strong storms, especially from eastern Texas to the southern
Mississippi Valley. In the wake of the front, dry, chilly air will
spill south through the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interior West will be dry and cold as high pressure
drifts over Wyoming. However, clouds and a few snow showers will
linger over some of the higher elevations of the central Rockies.
Unsettled weather with variable clouds, intermittent mountain snow
and a few coastal showers will persist in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern states will stay exceptionally mild. The day will
begin with areas of clouds and dense fog, which will yield to some
sun in most areas, especially away from the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Will of The Wind
</P>
<P>
   Weather in Denver depends on the will of the wind. On Saturday,
with dry winds from the west warming on descent from the Rockies,
the temperature reached 63 degrees. But as a storm system formed in
the southern Rockies on Sunday, moist winds from the northeast were
cooled as they ascended the sloping terrain. By early Monday, over
6 inches of snow had fallen around metropolitan Denver. Later this
week, a potent storm in southwestern Canada will cause strong winds
from the west to sweep across the Rockies, sending the mercury back
into the 60s by Friday.

LESSONS FROM A BLAST IN THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Calif. Fla.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when great amounts of heat-trapping greenhouse
gases are injected into the atmosphere in a relatively short span
of earth history, as is happening today as a result of the burning
of coal, oil and natural gas?
</P>
<P>
   One way to help answer this urgent climatic question of the day
is to examine what has happened in similar situations in the remote
past. Now American and Australian scientists are reporting evidence
that the biggest global warming in the last 100 million years may
have been touched off by a sudden blowout of greenhouse gases from
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say that for a relatively brief period around 55
million years ago, after the extinction of the dinosaurs but long
before the onset of today's pattern of periodic ice ages, the
temperature of the earth's surface in northern latitudes, and of
the deep ocean, soared by some 9 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   This is substantially more than the 5 to 9 degrees the world has
warmed since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   So great was the effect of the warming, experts say, that it
wiped out many species of marine life and created climatic
conditions that led to an explosive expansion in the number and
variety of mammal species. It was at this time that the primates,
from which Homo sapiens eventually evolved, first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy to today's conditions is far from perfect, and many
questions remain to be answered, but those who have investigated
the ancient warming spike say it reinforces a belief that has
lately been growing among climate scientists: that a gradual
warming of the climate can abruptly soar to new heights once a
certain threshold is reached. That is what scientists believe
happened in the case of the warming 55 million years ago _ and
perhaps what could happen again, in certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The chief greenhouse gas was and is carbon dioxide, and since
the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century, its
atmospheric concentration has gradually increased by nearly 30
percent. The average global surface temperature has risen by about
1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists believe, based on computerized simulations
of the climate's workings, that the temperature will rise by about
another 3.5 degrees by the year 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions
continue at the present rate.
</P>
<P>
   A gradual warming of unknown cause preceded the sharp upward
spike in temperature 55 million years ago, said Miriam E. Katz, a
paleooceanographer at Rutgers University, who is the leading author
of a report on the ancient phenomenon in the current issue of the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, the warming crossed a threshold that abruptly
kicked the temperature up to a new level, said another author of
the Science paper, Dr. Gerald R. Dickens of James Cook University
in Australia. He compared it to the stretching of a rubber band:
``You gradually pull at both ends and, at some instant, the rubber
band suddenly breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   What caused the climate to snap and send the temperature
soaring, according to a hypothesis formulated by Dickens, was a
sudden release of methane locked in the ocean floor, touched off by
the previous, more gradual warming. Methane is a greenhouse gas in
its own right, and when released from ocean sediments it also
combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide that eventually
percolates to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dorothy K. Pak of the University of California at Santa
Barbara and Dr. Kenneth G. Miller of Rutgers are the other authors
of the report in Science, which describes chemical and geological
evidence of the ancient rush of greenhouse gases and the way it
happened. The evidence was contained in corings and ultrasound
readings of sediments on a sub-sea promontory called the Blake
Nose, northeast of Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The researchers believe that the original, gradual warming,
beginning about 60 million years ago, caused a change in ocean
circulation currents that pushed warm surface waters down into the
deep sea. This deep-sea warming converted ice-like solid methane
locked in crystalline structures in the sea-floor sediments into
gaseous form.
</P>
<P>
   This gas then blasted upward through the sediment, starting
mudslides that freed the methane and allowed it to escape into the
water and eventually to the atmosphere. On the way, it reacted with
oxygen to produce globe-warming carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of the warming spike, Ms. Katz says, was to transform
the environment of the deep ocean, as evidenced by the extinction
of more than half of all species of microscopic bottom-dwelling
animals. The warming is also believed to have enabled that era's
relatively small array of mammals to spread out into formerly
frozen regions to colonize other continents, where they
proliferated in many evolutionary directions. Among these were the
ancestors of horses, apes and humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens has calculated that the sudden influx of carbon
associated with the sharp spike of global warming 55 million years
ago amounted to at least a billion billion metric tons. At present
rates of carbon-dioxide emission from global sources, about
two-thirds of that amount would be added to the atmosphere by 2100.
Some scientists say it is possible that before then, some threshold
could again be surpassed, resulting in an abrupt but unknown change
in climate.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions remain. The cause of the gradual warming that
preceded the spike 55 million years ago is unknown. Nor do
scientists know the magnitude of the atmospheric concentrations
before the gradual warming trend and the spike, frustrating
comparisons with today.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is not clear how much of the ancient warming
resulted from the influx of greenhouse gas and how much from
accompanying changes in ocean circulation; Dickens believes both
were involved.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication, says Dickens, is that the influx of
greenhouse gases was spewed initially into the ocean 55 million
years ago, but is going directly into the atmosphere today. That
difference could affect the rate of the consequent warming, since
the ocean's inertia might slow the migration of carbon dioxide into
the air, making the ancient warming spike less abrupt than
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence drawn from ocean sediments in the new study was not
fine-grained enough to determine just how sharp the ancient warming
was, Dr. Pak said, though it took place within a few thousand years
at most. Other large, abrupt climatic changes of the more recent
past _ during the transition out of the last ice age, for example _
have taken place within a human lifetime or less and sometimes
within a decade, according to recent evidence.
</P>
<P>
   All of these complications muddy the possible comparison between
what happened in the transformational climatic event 55 million
years ago and what is happening today. Nevertheless, says Dickens,
the ancient transformation provides a new and continuing
opportunity to explore the possible effects of growing
concentrations of greenhouse gases without resorting to
computer-assisted simulations of the climate.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, it teaches that ``the earth can, for natural
reasons, suddenly change dramatically.''

 &HT;    Five ways to make your holiday home safe
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving's right around the corner, which means the joining
of young and old. But sometimes, family get-togethers can end in
tragedy if relatives and friends don't take basic precautions
around youngsters. Five tips for a safe, child-proof holiday:
</P>
<P>
   1. Keep all hard candies and nuts off of coffee tables or end
tables. Choking is one of the greatest hazards of the holidays for
the little ones.
</P>
<P>
   2. Make a place in high cabinets for any medications for
visitors . Remind them to not keep medications in suitcases on the
floor or next to the bed where children can find them.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lock up all silver cleaners and household products.
</P>
<P>
   4. Post the numbers of local poison center or children's
hospital helpline. (In Atlanta, call 404-616-9000 or
1-800-282-5846)
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't let children eat raw batter because of the possibility
of salmonella in eggs.

 &HT;    It's `best of' time in Atlanta magazine
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, Atlanta ($3.50) has anointed the city's best _ from
Atlanta firefighter Matt Moseley for best show of bravery to Krispy
Kreme doughnuts for best guilty pleasure. Otherwise, if you want to
find the best new place to dance (Deux Plex), the best
five-and-dime (Richards Variety Store) or the best place to seduce
a man (the Supper Club), they're all here. All 299 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Also in this issue, the magazine celebrates 25 events that
shaped the city's soul. Among those: Father Thomas O'Reilly
persuading Gen. William T. Sherman not to burn the Catholic church;
a nervous 17-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. delivering a trial
sermon; the introduction of Coca-Cola; Ivan Allen's efforts to
desegregate the City Hall cafeteria; the debut of CNN; and the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Millennium mildness: If Time's ($3.50) prediction proves true,
this millennium is likely to go out with a whimper instead of a
bang. Some of us are going to party like it's 1999, but more and
more people are planning a quiet, meaningful New Year's Eve.
``They're staying at home hiding under their beds, playing with
their dogs, playing with their babies and wishing it were 1954,''
says trend watcher Faith Popcorn. Hotels and resorts that were
anticipating record business have had to slash their prices. Most
Britons also plan to stay home, says Nicola Lloyd of Selfridge's
department store, which conducted a recent survey. ``People don't
need to go mad. They just want a night to remember with family and
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what about that pesky Y2K bug? Washington is setting
up a $50 million command center to monitor the situation, but the
biggest problems are expected in China, India and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cyberslacking: Workers who spend an inordinate amount of time
surfing the Internet for fun at work may be in for a surprise.
Newsweek ($3.50) reports that more corporations are cracking down
on the amount of recreational time cubicle dwellers spend online.
New technology gives bosses the power to monitor everything that
workers write online, including personal e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Religious experience: The New Yorker ($3) gets spiritual this
week with an essay by John Updike on the future of faith at the end
of the millennium and a series of stunning photographs of the
faithful by Richard Avedon. Reflecting on a trip through Italy,
Updike describes how his ``feeble faith'' was rejuvenated during a
thunderstorm one night in Florence. The nature of faith may change
with scientific discoveries, he concludes, but the yearning for
``something more'' will persist. Avedon captures that yearning with
his powerful images of the Dalai Lama, flagellants in Spain and a
naked holy man in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Step by step: When families get together this Thanksgiving,
the scene is not likely to resemble Norman Rockwell's classic
portrait. According to U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50),
stepfamilies soon will outnumber traditional families. Getting all
of the various exes and stepchildren to mesh into a new family is
difficult, if not impossible. Experts advise against rushing
things. ``It usually takes up to two years for the stepfamily to
emerge from an initial period of conflict,'' says reporter Wray
Herbert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Norman Rockwell gets more ink this week in People
($2.99), which examines the artist's often turbulent life and the
critical reappraisal of his work. ``The subjects may be
straightforward and simple, but the images are complex,'' says Ned
Rifkin, outgoing director of Atlanta's High Museum. ... The
Advocate ($3.95) talks to Michael Landon's son, Christopher, about
growing up gay and his career as a scriptwriter. One of his latest
scripts is the story of a straight man marooned on an island with a
gay man. A lot of studios were interested, Landon says, ``but they
weren't prepared to make the film.''

 &HT;    New life for an eccentric `Man on the Moon'
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy, did you hear about this one?
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after you left our planet on a nose dive into
obscurity, a big-time Hollywood director (Milos Forman) and one of
the country's hottest comedic actors (Jim Carrey) have made a movie
about your life. Yes, your closely guarded and eccentrically weird
life, Andy Kaufman. The soundtrack to the movie, which is being
heavily hyped by a major label with music videos and
celebrity-drenched parties, arrives in stores today. And the talent
behind the CD (sorry, they don't make little vinyl 45s like your
Mighty Mouse record anymore) is one of rock's most respected bands,
R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Man on the Moon'' countdown is thanks largely to the
uncharted brain of singer/lyricist Michael Stipe. The movie
biography based on the life of the late comic opens Dec. 22 and is
already the curiosity of the entertainment press, with sneak-peek
photos of Carrey-as-Kaufman leaking out like snapshots of the Loch
Ness monster. Talk of the picture's eerie accuracy has even landed
Carrey on the cover of Vanity Fair. Odds are none of this would
have happened if it weren't for Stipe, who wrote the lyrics for the
band's 1992 hit ``Man on the Moon'' about Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the soundtrack's release, bassist/keyboardist Mike
Mills doesn't hesitate to give R.E.M. credit for the Andy Movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are most definitely responsible for it,'' he says in his
Athens office, pulling an advance copy of the ``Man on the Moon''
soundtrack out of a cardboard box. ``When we put the song out, we
incorporated some footage of Andy doing Elvis into the video. His
family saw that and felt like it was time to give Andy his due. So
they did the (television) documentary, and from it came the idea of
the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the band was finishing the album ``Automatic for
the People,'' Kaufman had become a distant shadow in pop culture,
vaguely remembered as ``that guy on ``Taxi.''' When Stipe appeared
in the studio late one night with lyrics to an as yet untitled
track of music written by bandmates Mills and Peter Buck, it had
been eight years since the comic died from lung cancer at age 35.
Mills recalls that Stipe had scribbled down a
stream-of-consciousness dialogue with Kaufman, posing this
now-familiar question to the great beyond: ``Andy, are you goofing
on Elvis?'' The tune, ``Man on the Moon,'' became a hit single,
sparking a fascination with Kaufman that eventually made him a
hotter act in death than he was in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that his death probably brought more attention to his
wildness and craziness, and the R.E.M. influence added to that,''
says Ron DiNunzio, co-owner of the Atlanta comedy club the Punch
Line.
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriters apparently knew from the beginning that they
wanted to use the song ``Man on the Moon,'' feeling it was
essential to Kaufman's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they brought in the script, it had the title `Man on the
Moon' on it,'' says producer Stacy Sher. ``The second I finished
reading the script, I whipped out my R.E.M. CD and started
listening to the song again, and it made me cry. I don't know if
Milos had ever heard it, but obviously Danny (DeVito), Andy's
family and the folks close to Andy have always felt that R.E.M.'s
song kind of brought Andy back to people's consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   When Universal executives approached Warner Bros. Records for
permission to use the original track, though, they hit snags.
Eventually, the script got through to R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they read it,'' Sher says, ``they really loved it, and we
all agreed we would try to work it out. We all felt like none of us
would deal with the business issues if the creative issues worked
out. And that's exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. expressed interest in being even more involved in the
project. It wanted to help shape the mood and sound of the movie,
and asked to write the score as well. ``We've wanted to do a score
for a long time, but it had to be the right set of circumstances,''
Mills says.
</P>
<P>
   The band faced several challenges. It had just released the CD
``Up'' and was preparing for a world tour. In March and April, the
only time R.E.M. could work on the project, the movie was still in
production, with few scenes completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the band would have sat down and started doing this
when there was a locked picture, which would have been the middle
of June,'' says R.E.M. manager and attorney Bertis Downs. ``But we
were on tour in the middle of June, and they knew that.'' So Mills
and guitarist Buck wrote music by watching dailies shipped to them
after a scene was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Background music was written primarily for piano and horns,
although there's an orchestral version of the song ``Man on the
Moon'' in the movie in addition to a portion of the original
single. The band, with Stipe, also penned a new tune for the movie,
``The Great Beyond,'' which was released as a single and video last
week. Bathed in neon, the band appears inside a TV set with Stipe
pressing on the glass like a trapped goldfish until the box falls
off a table onto the floor. Mills says the goal was to capture some
of the Kaufman's quirky lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack is a mix of music that is often as enigmatic and
unpredictable as Kaufman himself. In addition to R.E.M.'s material,
it includes ``Angela (The Theme From `Taxi'),'' a Stipe duet with
Carrey-as-Andy called ``This Friendly World'' and Carrey as Kaufman
alter ego Tony Clifton singing the disco hit ``I Will Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills says he's seen the movie twice, adding ``Carrey is great.
This guy can act, there's no question. He should have gotten an
Oscar nomination for `The Truman Show.' He'll definitely get one
for this. They said that for nine months he (Carrey) was either
Andy or Tony, but I didn't speak with him enough to notice,'' Mills
says. ``I guess that's method acting.''
</P>
<P>
   As for R.E.M., Stipe, Buck and Mills plan to dedicate two weeks
in December to promote the soundtrack and the movie, including an
appearance at the Los Angeles premiere. Then, Mills says, the band
will take a break and, in spring, begin work on a new album.
Although Stipe has jumped headlong into moviemaking with his own
independent production company (``Being John Malkovich''), it's not
so certain that his bandmates will do another movie project anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is very tough to deal with,'' Mills says. ``While
this was fun, I don't want to be in the business. Hollywood is just
too weird and silly and unpredictable. It's very frustrating,
because when we're making a record, we're only trying to please
three guys and our producer, and make beautiful music. With the
movie, it's not about beautiful music. It's about music that
enhances the scene, stays away from the dialogue. You have to make
everybody happy.''

 &HT;    Much more a soundtrack than an R.E.M. release
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't mistake this for a new R.E.M. album. And don't expect to
get too much of an idea of how the band stacks up against full-time
movie music composers. It's much more an artifact of Milos Forman's
biopic of gonzo comedian Andy Kaufman. Included are bits of
dialogue and Kaufman-related tunes (Bob James' theme from ``Taxi,''
a lounge-singer-from-hell's version of ``I Will Survive''), two
versions of the R.E.M. song that inspired the movie's title (the
original ``Man on the Moon,'' and an orchestral take). There's a
sampling of the band's soundtrack contributions, theme music that
can be either bittersweet or bumptious, and betrays an ear familiar
with the distinctive way Burt Bacharach arranged for brass.
</P>
<P>
   The group's one big new number, ``The Great Beyond,'' was
previewed on R.E.M.'s recent U.S. tour and evokes the atmospheric
tone of its best work: emotionally direct, poetic without being
cloying, sweet and wishful. Despite the Middle Eastern swirls of
keyboards and strings that introduce the song, it's less satisfying
in its subdued studio version if you first heard it as a
rip-roaring concert number. Either way, though, it plucks the
heartstrings.

   Simon Schama's sumptuous new book on Rembrandt bears about as
much resemblance to traditional biographies of the painter as
``Tristram Shandy'' and ``Moby-Dick'' do to conventional novels.
Impassioned and learned, expansive and discursive, ``Rembrandt's
Eyes'' not only leaves us with a fierce appreciation of the
artist's work but also immerses us inexorably in his world.

   Schama _ the author of ``The Embarrassment of Riches,'' an
anthropologically detailed cultural history of the Dutch republic
from 1550-1650 _ fleshes out Rembrandt's story with long
digressions about daily life in Amsterdam, conventions in Flemish
portrait painting, religious tensions in 17th-century Holland and
Catholic and Protestant tastes in art. A large portion of this
volume is devoted to Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt's great
predecessor and role model, whom he emulated for a decade with
fierce adoration, and many chapters are filled with chatty asides
about rival artists and the subjects of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Schama, however, defiantly refutes recent arguments (set forth
most notably by the scholar Gary Schwartz in a 1986 biography of
the painter) that Rembrandt's art was largely a reflection of his
patrons' tastes and predilections, a kind of barometer of literary,
cultural and social currents of the day. Although Rembrandt was
``an intensely social'' animal, Schama writes, ``it's impossible to
look at his strongest work, either in painting, drawing or etching,
and still not be struck by the simple truth that he achieved things
which, as Durer wrote in another context, `could not, in his day be
found.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he is dismantling the myth of Rembrandt the
Conformist, Schama is also questioning the equally potent myth of
Rembrandt the Rebel. ``He never wished to fly in the face of his
patrons' basic requirements,'' Schama writes, ``but rather sought
to transform them into something impossible to envision from
antecedents.'' As for the popular view of Rembrandt as the
self-obsessed genius (a view fueled by the dozens of remarkable
self-portraits in a variety of poses and costumes), Schama argues,
``The reason for the multiplication of his self-image was not a
relentless, almost monomaniacal assertion of the artistic ego but
something like the exact opposite, Rembrandt's experimental
dissolution of his self into countless other personae: the soldier,
the beggar, the bourgeois, the prince, the Antwerp master.''
</P>
<P>
   The one weakness of this book is that while Schama effectively
debunks both Romantic and revisionist conceptions of Rembrandt, he
does not replace them with a persuasive portrait of his own.
Instead he gives us wordy generalities like, ``Rembrandt was, as we
have already noticed, Everyman.'' Or, Rembrandt ``is Hamlet in
Holland, an inward-outward persona, a poet in heavy metal, the
embodiment of both the active and the contemplative life.'' The
reader finishes the book convinced that all the talk about
Rembrandt's inconstancy and fondness for personas says less about
him than it does about Schama's ambivalence and confusion about his
subject's personality.
</P>
<P>
   In one chapter Schama writes that at the height of Rembrandt's
fame there was ``nothing at all to suggest the foul-tempered
martinet of the posthumous caricatures''; in another he writes that
there is ``no doubt that Rembrandt's fuse was short.''
</P>
<P>
   In one chapter he writes that ``his work would be marked by
intense literary passion''; in another he observes that ``the
indispensability to Rubens of his library and Rembrandt's apparent
lack of interest in a literary collection is something that
genuinely separates their sensibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily for the reader such lapses do not intrude upon the
discussions of Rembrandt's paintings, the heart of this book and a
testament to Schama's gifts as a critic and cultural historian.
Writing with a scholar's knowledge of iconography and technique and
a layman's common sense, Schama does an eloquent job of tracing the
process whereby Rembrandt mastered the lessons of Rubens, emulating
his predecessor's religious and historical canvases and producing a
series of ``big, violent, visceral'' masterpieces packed with
``lurching, lunging, bone-crunching action,'' and then slowly
overcame his anxiety of influence to discover a voice and vision of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt's physical feel for the texture of paint; his gift for
mapping character through a fleeting expression or gesture; his
ability to strip away superfluous detail to expose an essential
narrative; his talent for capturing the tension between ``the
glitter of the hard, unforgivingly metallic surface of the world
and the vulnerability of mortal flesh'': all are explicated in
these pages with thoughtful erudition.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing crucial paintings like ``The Supper at Emmaus''
(1628), ``The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp'' (1632), ``Danae''
(1636), ``The Night Watch'' (1642) and ``The Staalmeesters''
(1662), Schama skillfully shows how Rembrandt managed to invest
historical and mythological figures with the emotional immediacy of
ordinary men and women while learning to infuse humdrum domestic
scenes with a heightened sense of drama. He shows how Rembrandt
routinely breached the barriers between genres of painting, mixing
the high and the low, the classical and colloquial. He shows, too,
how Rembrandt remade the conventions of the portrait painting.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Schama points out, the artist's style underwent
a considerable evolution. After the deaths of his wife, Saskia, and
of Rubens, Rembrandt's grandiose history paintings began to give
way in the 1640's to more meditative works: his palette
increasingly relied on four basic colors (black, white, yellow
ocher and earth reds), and the action in his paintings grew ``less
strenuously physical and more philosophically metaphysical.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade of his career, which produced a series of
luminous, pared-down masterpieces, ``Rembrandt redoubled his
experimental determination in the face of increasing evidence of
its unpopularity,'' adopting a gestural style even as more
fashionable painters ``were working toward a more colorful,
brilliantly lit and smoothly painted manner.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters further, the scent of scandal that hovered
over Rembrandt's later life (bankruptcy, a public feud with a
former lover, an illegitimate child) helped galvanize criticism
that he was a painter ``bent on limning ugliness'': an artist who
took ``perverse pleasure in surveying the most unappetizing
features of the human body and the most sordid rustic hovels,'' a
man with a ``peculiar attraction to the decrepit.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Schama observes at the end of this illuminating book,
Rembrandt saw imperfections as the norm of humanity: ``Which is why
he will always speak across the centuries to those for whom art
might be something other than the quest for ideal forms; to the
unnumbered legions of damaged humanity who recognize, instinctively
and with gratitude, Rembrandt's vision of our fallen race, with all
its flaws and infirmities squarely on view, as a proper subject for
picturing, and, more important, as worthy of love, of saving
grace.''

<P>
   Q. How do scientists tell what sex a fossil is, or was, when
they have only one example?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``You never know for sure, but there are clues in the shape
and size of bony landmarks on the skull,'' said John Krigbaum, an
anthropologist at New York University who is a doctoral candidate.
``The skull is the easiest to sex. You usually can't sex other
bones reliably, except for the pelvis.''
</P>
<P>
   With the skull, what scientists look for is the difference
between what is called robust morphology, meaning typically
heavier, larger shapes and sizes, and gracile morphology, meaning
smaller and more ``graceful'' shapes. Krigbaum explained that males
tend to be more robust in the brow ridge, the mastoid process
behind the ear and the lower jaw.
</P>
<P>
   But with only one fossil example, researchers must rely on what
they know of the species and make an educated guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very real problem,'' Krigbaum said, and it has a name:
the species problem. ``It is unclear whether you are looking at a
species that has a marked difference in size between the sexes,
called sexual dimorphism, or an entirely different species,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer you get to humans in the fossil record,'' he said,
``the better idea you have of how females and males differ in body
shape. But a lot of skulls we know of as isolates, like Homo
erectus fossils in Southeast Asia, you can't be sure if they are
male or female.''

<P>
   DAVIS, Calif. _ It's the New World's Vatican of viticulture, the
oracle of grape-growing, the arbiter of winery practice. The
University of California's department of viticulture and enology
trains most of California's winemakers and provides root stock for
much of the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The department's geneticist, Carole Meredith, has recently been
shaking up a lot of the Old World as well as the New. With a new
method of unraveling the grapevine's tangled family tree, she has
shown that several of the world's best known wine grapes are not
pure strains but hybrids between other varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Her findings, which have in many cases been a surprise for grape
breeders, undermine the theoretical basis for France's quality
control system, the Appellation d'Origine Controlee, which denies
its label to wine made from hybrid varieties on the assumption that
such grapes are inferior to their parents. Dr. Meredith's research
has shown that the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, from which one of the
world's best known red wines is made, and the Chardonnay grape,
source of a leading white wine, are both hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 5,000 varieties of wine grape in the world,
several of which have been grown at least since Roman times. All
are the progeny of the wild grape Vitis vinifera but the puzzle of
how they may be related to each other has long been left to wine
historians and ampelographers, an obscure guild of experts who
pronounce on a vine's ancestry by minutely examining its leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Both the historical and leaf scrutiny methods have been left in
the dust by Dr. Meredith's new method. With John Bowers, then a
graduate student of hers, Dr. Meredith recognized several years ago
that the DNA fingerprinting method used in forensic cases could be
adapted to the vine. Since 1996 she and Bowers have roamed through
the leading Californian and French varieties, conducting paternity
tests and establishing quite unexpected liaisons between grapes of
very different repute.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying a grape variety by its DNA is a matter of commercial
as well as historical interest. Because the department's nursery is
a major source of virus-free root stock, it has become the ultimate
arbiter of vine identity. But many of its varieties were misnamed
because they came originally from Europe in the 19th century before
the importance of accurate provenance was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming mistakes in this collection are legion, and have caused
inconvenience for both the California wine industry and importers
of plant material from Davis,'' says a stern entry in the latest
edition of the Oxford Companion to Wine, a leading reference work.
</P>
<P>
   To clear up this confusion, Dr. Meredith tried various kinds of
DNA typing before hitting on the same approach used in forensic DNA
fingerprinting. In collaboration with colleagues in Australia who
had had the same idea, she developed a fingerprinting system for
the grape and used it to sort out the vines in the department's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   With the fingerprinting system in hand, she found she possessed
a powerful tool for slicing through the fog of history and legend
that surrounds the ancestry of most grape varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Though wild grapes come in male and female forms that breed
sexually, those in vineyards are usually propagated by hand from
rootstock, so that in principle each new vine is a clone, meaning
it is genetically identical to its parent. Over the centuries,
however, mutations of various sorts have accumulated, creating
genetic differences between clones that are very slight but still
of interest to growers. Types believed to be very ancient, like
Pinot, have not had sex for some 2,000 years, yet varieties of
Pinot exist, their genetic variation presumably caused just by
mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Other varieties are the result either of deliberate breeding or
accidental cross-fertilization. But the records of most such
crosses have long been lost. Dr. Meredith's first genealogical
success came in 1996 in discovering the ancestry of Cabernet
Sauvignon, the grape from which one of the world's best known red
wines is produced. The variety is known to have been grown in
Bordeaux in the 17th century but its origin has long been a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the grape and both of its unacknowledged
parents had already been entered in the small database of 50
varieties that she and Bowers had accumulated. Mulling over the DNA
fingerprint data in bed one Saturday morning, the dedicated Bowers
noticed that Cabernet Sauvignon must be a cross between Cabernet
franc, a well-known red wine grape, and a white grape known as
Sauvignon blanc. The word ``sauvignon,'' meaning ``wild,'' did not
denote any suspected genetic relationship, but merely that both
varieties resembled wild grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meredith suspects the cross arose accidentally between
Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc grapes growing in neighboring
vineyards. This was the first objective scientific data on the
origin of a classic wine grape, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest triumph came in unraveling the kinship of a large
family of important wine grapes, none of which had been known to be
related to each other. Deliciously, one of the parents of this
large and noble family turned out to be a derided and
long-forgotten grape called gouais blanc, which, despite its
Cinderella-like origins, evidently made a fine breeding partner.
</P>
<P>
   Working with colleagues at the French genetic stock bank, the
National Institute of Agronomic Research at Domaine de Vassal, near
Montpellier, Dr. Meredith selected some 300 varieties that from
appearance or historical records she guessed might be related to
one another.
</P>
<P>
   When the grapes were DNA fingerprinted, a remarkable family
relationship emerged that included some of the best known wine
grapes in the world. The two parents were gouais blanc and Pinot, a
fine red wine grape whose pedigree stretches back to the first
century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Just as human parents produce children of very different
character, Pinot and gouais turn out to be the progenitors of 16
very different wine grapes. Three are known throughout the world.
Chardonnay is perhaps the leading variety of white wine. Gamay is
the grape from which all Beaujolais is derived. And melon, a third
Pinot-gouais offspring, is the source of all Muscadet. These
findings were reported in the Sept. 3 issue of Science.

</P>
<P>
   Bowers, a co-author of the research, now works at the University
of Georgia where, even though his family has strong ties to the
California wine industry, he has switched to studying the genetics
of sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meredith too grew up in the San Francisco Bay area and went
to the Davis campus of the University of California, her father
deeming Berkeley too radical. She became the arbiter of grapevine
genealogy by an unusual route. Having skipped a lot of classes as a
college student, she worked selling plants in a nursery and became
fascinated with the rich variety of petunias and marigolds that
passed through her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding she wanted to go back to school and study plant
genetics, she talked her way into graduate school at U.C. Davis and
did a Ph.D. on the genetics of tomatoes. She then worked with two
plant biotechnology companies but found she did not enjoy life in
industry for an understandable reason. ``I really resented having a
boss,'' she says. ``I didn't like telling him what I planned to do
and getting his permission to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 she joined the U.C. Davis department of viticulture and
enology (academese for grape growing and wine making), succeeding
Harold Olmo, a well known grape breeder, as the department's plant
geneticist.
</P>
<P>
   To establish her scientific credentials, she worked on tobacco,
a well-studied plant, until she got tenure. Only then did she focus
on the grape, a difficult plant whose genetics are not nearly as
well understood. Her appreciation of the risks was well founded.
The winemakers who supported the department's research saw no quick
payoff in her work and in 1991 she was almost forced to close her
lab. It was after this crisis that she started work on the problem
of identifying grape varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes, like people, have sites on their DNA where the same few
genetic letters are repeated over and over in a biologically
meaningless stutter. The number of repeats changes quite often from
one generation to another, which makes them useful markers of
identity. The repeat number at any one site may not identify an
individual, but the more sites are considered, the greater the
chances of defining an individual uniquely.
</P>
<P>
   In the population of the United States, the FBI uses the number
of repeats at 13 different sites. To define a grape, some 20 to 30
markers are needed. This is not because grapes are more complicated
than people _ they have only 19, very small, chromosomes _ but
because most grape varieties are close relatives and more markers
are needed to distinguish among them.
</P>
<P>
   With partners in nine other wine-growing countries, Dr. Meredith
has formed the Vitis Microsatellite Consortium to share information
about the diagnostic repeat sites, which are known as
microsatellites to geneticists. So far 154 of these sites have been
identified. They are also helpful to grape breeders because they
serve to locate the position on the DNA of desired genes. Dr.
Meredith hopes the sites will help solve the major mystery of grape
growing, which is why the same variety may produce a great wine in
some environments and a lousy one in others. ``I think we are
really on the threshold of understanding these things,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she unraveled the long-puzzling relationship among
three similarly named wine grapes _ France's Syrah, California's
Petite Sirah and Australia's Shiraz. It turns out that Shiraz is
the same as Syrah, and Petite Sirah is a cross between Syrah and an
obscure French grape called Peloursin.
</P>
<P>
   Further work, which Dr. Meredith has not yet published, has
shown that Syrah itself is a hybrid of Dureza, a dark-berried grape
of the Ardeche region of France, and a white grape known as
mondeuse blanche. Syrah, surmised to be the grape known to the
Romans as Vitis Allobrogica, is Dr. Meredith's favorite. With her
husband, Stephen Lagier, a winemaker, she has started growing Syrah
on a vineyard they own in the Napa Valley. She plans to sell her
Syrah commercially next year and feels the venture has given her a
better understanding of her students, many of whom come to the
department having been out of school for many years and with a
passion to learn winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here I couldn't understand that because I
was thinking just as a scientist,'' she says. ``But now I am making
my own wine from our own land, I am living out a dream.''

   NEW YORK _ The VIP lounge is spoken for at $500,000, as is the
box office at $250,000. But the penthouse lobby is still up for
grabs at $1.5 million, along with the orchestra pit ($350,000) and
four restrooms ($75,000 each).
</P>
<P>
   While one mega-donor, et unannounced, is in the wings, there
may still be the slightest chance of seeing your name atop the
marquee of the Roundabout Theater Company's new 740-seat flagship
on West 42nd Street, for about $10 million, give or take a million
or two.
</P>
<P>
   With the old Selwyn Theater undergoing a $21.5 million
transformation from woebegone B-movie house to its gilded 1918
neo-Renaissance origins, the long-nomadic, nonprofit Roundabout,
which chanced upon the choice site at a prime moment, is seeking
benefactors the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got it, we name it,'' said Julia C. Levy, the executive
director in charge of external affairs and the company's chief
fund-raiser, ticking off the ``gift opportunities'' still available
in the time-honored way that cultural institutions have adopted to
finance capital improvements by conferring immortality on large
donors. About three-quarters of the needed money has been
committed, Ms. Levy said, and the theater is scheduled to reopen on
March 21, three months later than originally scheduled, with a
production of Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' starring Roger Rees, Laura
Linney and Sir Derek Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   For a subscription theater with more than its share of hard-luck
stories _ a fatal Times Square crane collapse shut down its runaway
hit revival of ``Cabaret'' on West 43rd Street for four weeks in
1998 at a loss of $2 million, and the empty Selwyn shell itself
collapsed into a pile of debris on Dec. 30, 1997 _ the Roundabout's
latest stroke of fortune is a coup. It surpasses even the
award-winning productions of ``Anna Christie'' in 1993 and ``She
Loves Me'' in 1994, which propelled the Roundabout into the
forefront of the nation's nonprofit stage companies.
</P>
<P>
   How the Roundabout snagged a key parcel amid the most
sought-after real estate in New York City was largely happenstance,
theater executives and 42nd Street redevelopment officials said.
While some other theater troupes might now cast an envious eye on
the deal, many agreed that none seemed more suited to the space, or
deserving of it, than the Roundabout, the nation's second-largest
nonprofit theater, after Lincoln Center's. The company is at a
record 41,000 annual subscribers and has a budget of $19 million,
not including its hit Broadway production of ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered the Selwyn, but there were a lot of other things
going on,'' said Lynne Meadow, artistic director of the Manhattan
Theater Club, which has also been intermittently looking for a
Broadway site to augment its two auditoriums at City Center that
seat 300 and 150.
</P>
<P>
   James Houghton, founding artistic director of the Signature
Theater Co., agreed. ``It makes total sense that they're there,''
he said. His company, which offers seasons devoted to one
playwright at a time, was delighted with its smaller quarters on
West 42nd Street. ``There's no way we would want a theater of that
size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Joseph Papp Public Theater, with five stages in its
Greenwich Village headquarters and the use of Central Park for its
summer Shakespeare productions, also took a look at the Selwyn but
passed on it as an unaffordable luxury, said the theater's
spokeswoman, Carol Fineman.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Rent'' had been taken by the authentically
dilapidated setting of the Selwyn but ultimately settled on the
Nederlander in what was then an unfashionable precinct a block
south of 42nd Street. As for the commercial theater, which strives
to make a profit, a smallish house with high reconstruction costs
like the Selwyn made no sense at all, said Rocco Landesman, the
president of Jujamcyn, the city's third-largest theater chain.
</P>
<P>
   Which left, essentially, the Roundabout, whose largest capital
campaign to date had been $2.6 million for its Laura Pels Theater.
Now all the company had to do was raise the money: a price tag that
started off modestly enough at $7 million in 1996 and is likely to
top $22 million by the time the reconstruction is finished.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the last of the old showhouses on 42nd Street to be
reclaimed _ only two remain, the Liberty and the Times Square _ the
Selwyn is ripe for sponsorship, Ms. Levy said, starting with a
renaming in honor of some lucky, and very rich, benefactor. A
prospective namesake has come forward, although details remain to
be worked out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since being turned out earlier this year from the Criterion
Center on Broadway and 45th Street, which its landlord repossessed
for redevelopment in the Times Square building boom, the Roundabout
is staging its productions, including ``The Rainmaker'' and
``Cabaret,'' in leased Broadway and Off Broadway theaters. It has
taken permanent office space in a garment center building at 231
West 39th Street and is still looking for a small stage to replace
the Laura Pels Theater, which it gave up in the Criterion Center.
</P>
<P>
   As work crews from the Ryder Construction Corp. sawed, hammered
and painted in the Selwyn around them, Ms. Levy and Todd Haimes,
the Roundabout's artistic director, who has seen the company
through a decade and a half's suspenseful cycles of bust and boom,
traipsed one recent morning through the scaffolded interior of the
theater's first permanent home in its nearly 35-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, west of the New Victory Theater and the Ford
Center, is to share the 10-story New 42nd Studios (with its own
200-seat experimental theater, the Duke) owned by the sponsoring
group, the New 42nd Street Inc., which oversees the seven reclaimed
theaters on the block and gave the Roundabout a long-term lease.
The terms, including a below-market rental, remain confidential,
but with renewals the Roundabout's tenancy should extend into the
mid-21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes, in a blue pin-stripe suit and white hard hat, peered
around the edges of the sprawling stage, 75 feet wide by 50 feet
deep. ``That's the wing space we never had,'' he said. ``That's the
fly space we never had.'' He looked down, wistful. ``The orchestra
pit,'' he said. ``We never had one before.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater has only 14 rows of orchestra seats spread in a wide
arc, and a similarly shallow balcony, so the audience will be
unusually close to the action, Haimes said. Parts of the mezzanine
cornices and boxes were chopped away when the theater became a
movie house in the 1930s and are being restored.
</P>
<P>
   Prized amenities in the new theater include a 3,500-square-foot
penthouse lobby and catering area above the theater overlooking
43rd Street and just above that a smaller private lounge for large
contributors. That V.I.P. space has been underwritten by Nabisco
with a $500,000 contribution. ``We call it the `Oreo Lounge'
affectionately for our favorite cookie,'' Ms. Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   The penthouse lobby is still seeking a benefactor at three times
the price, she said, along with other variously priced components:
the green room, coat check, dressing rooms, boxes and individual
seats, even the plasterwork and the restrooms. Ms. Levy said that
the naming of the theater itself, for about $10 million, remains to
be agreed upon. That money, she said, is to go into an endowment to
keep the Roundabout solvent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, about $15 million of the $21.5 million goal has
been committed, Ms. Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   For a theater whose name nicely captures the itinerant nature of
its turbulent history, the Roundabout stumbled into its happy
ending, accounts from executives and officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 the 42nd Street Entertainment Corp., as it was then
called, charged with trying to revive a street long mired in
pornography and crime, issued a ``request for use'' to redevelop
six historic theaters on the block between Broadway and Eighth
Avenue. About 800 groups received the solicitation, recalled
Rebecca Robertson, then the project's vice president and now vice
president for real estate at the Shubert Organization. Forty-four
responded, including Imax, the Knitting Factory, the Manhattan
Theater Club and the Roundabout.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout, the Flying Dutchman of theater companies, had a
long history of homelessness. Founded in 1965 and installed
initially in the basement of a supermarket in Chelsea, the
struggling troupe moved next to a nearby RKO movie house but by
1978 had gone bankrupt. Still, it stayed alive despite mounting
debts, and in 1984, the year after Haimes took over as business
manager, found temporary space in the Fashion Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   As that lease approached expiration in 1990, Haimes started
looking elsewhere. But he was not enthusiastic about derelict 42nd
Street. ``He felt sorry for me,'' Ms. Robertson said. ``He thought
I had the worst job in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The renamed New 42nd Street Inc., was first empowered to start
evaluating the redevelopment proposals in 1991, by which time many
of the prospective bidders had dropped out or had been found
unsuitable. The Roundabout itself had withdrawn, signing instead a
20-year lease on a 499-seat theater in the Criterion Center on
Broadway; in 1995 it opened a second performance space, a 399-seat
theater, the Laura Pels.
</P>
<P>
   But change was finally coming to 42nd Street. In 1992 New 42nd
Street provided a big starting push with a commitment to open the
New Victory Theater for children's productions by 1994. (It
actually opened in 1995.) In March 1993 Michael D. Eisner, chairman
of the Walt Disney Co., toured the block and by the end of the year
had agreed to take over the New Amsterdam Theater, which by 1997
would showcase ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Livent Inc. agreed to rebuild two theaters into what
became the Ford Center, where in 1997 Livent opened its hit musical
``Ragtime.'' Soon other developers announced ambitious
entertainment plans for the block.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, 1996, at the memorial service for Bernard B. Jacobs,
who had been president of Shubert, Haimes found himself sitting
next to Ms. Robertson, and the question of the Selwyn came up
again. ``It sounds disrespectful, I know,'' Ms. Robertson said. But
she thought that Jacobs, of all people, would understand, and she
pressed Haimes for once and for all to look at the theater.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the end of the year he had a series of meetings with Cora
Cahan, who had become president of New 42nd Street , and a deal was
outlined. Although she had fulfilled her requirement of two
nonprofit theaters on the block (the New Victory and the rehearsal
studios and Duke stage), adding another of the Roundabout's stature
would be seen as a responsible counterweight to the accelerating
commercial exploitation of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout still had a lease running to 2010 on the
Criterion Center. But the building's owner, Charles B. Moss Jr.,
invoking an escape clause after seven years, told the Roundabout he
intended to evict it to redevelop the building.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said that when he began looking at the Selwyn he had no
way of knowing that the Roundabout, once again, would face
homelessness. But this time, he said, his business background
really paid off. ``I noticed everything going on around me,'' he
said. ``I said, `Let's do something before a crisis.' We were very
lucky.''

BUT WHAT WILL WE EAT ON FRIDAY? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   We are doing something different this year, going to a
restaurant for Thanksgiving. We are not rejecting tradition or
creating a new one. This is only a slight modification, an
experiment to deviate from the normal ritual that turns the house
into a mess hall. We thought about it after a friend told of taking
his family of six to a Buddhist temple for Thanksgiving dinner. And
remembering that old Christmas movie where everyone ends up happily
eating Chinese food after the neighborhood dogs get the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Some are shocked by this, as if we were boycotting the Macy's
parade and banning football talk. But, we say it will be an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, who will continue their at home-tradition, are curious
about our plan but say their family wouldn't stand for messing with
the ritual and were they to insist, they couldn't live with the
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   We say we will still be together with family and friends. We
will still get to stuff ourselves and thank our blessings. But we
will not have to clean up after.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we won't have to clean up before. Nor will we have to
get up at 6 a.m. to handle innards and toss ole Tom around the
kitchen. We can skip the debate whether to go exotic with the
stuffing or plain, knowing that plain always wins. The man with the
knife will not have to chase crowds from the kitchen five minutes
to sit-down and the sous chef will not be spilling brandy into her
coffee before noon.
</P>
<P>
   It will not matter that we never have enough cloth napkins or
chairs. We will have a long leisurely morning. Perhaps we will take
a walk along the ocean. Maybe we'll rent a movie. If we want we can
sit in pajamas until afternoon when it's time to put on clothes and
go over the river and through the woods to a big, old Italian
restaurant known for its checkered tablecloths, jug red and
multi-course feeds.
</P>
<P>
   Does this seem shallow and pathetic? Will we be scorned for
taking the easy way out? Or will we be pitied as holiday orphans
who must break bread with strangers because they have no family of
their own? We will see.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving rituals run deep. You are supposed to spend
Thanksgiving at home _ your own or someone's home with whom you
share, if not blood, at least history. On New Year's you can mingle
and kiss strangers, but there is to be nothing out of the ordinary
on Thanksgiving, although there was that year when we dressed as
Native Americans and Pilgrims and had a picnic at Tilden Park in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be turkey, we are asked? Of course there will be
turkey, but there will also be ravioli if one's in the mood. And
cranberry sauce? And gravy and stuffing?
</P>
<P>
   We know what's going on here. People who never even nod at a
cranberry the rest of the year require the sauce on this singular
day. On that same day they can't imagine being in a ravioli mood.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is leftovers. What then do we eat on the days
after? Doggy bags are not the same as having half a carcass in your
refrigerator, being able to tear off a perfect strip of dark meat
to cover with ketchup and hot peppers and stick in a dinner roll.
And then picking under foil for a forkful of cold, gooey stuffing.
What about day-old pumpkin pie, starting to pull from the crust, a
different color and some say a richer taste than when first served?
</P>
<P>
   An entrepreneurial type might do well to create a line of
holiday leftovers _ day-old mashed potatoes and gravy, broccoli
with cheese sauce, all the better and homier after sitting for 24
hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're thinking that maybe on Saturday, just for fun, we'll
do a small turkey. And, you know, if people are around to eat,
that's fine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was suggested to Wayne Johnston that his new book, ``The
Colony of Unrequited Dreams,'' might be the Great Newfoundland
Novel, a smile crossed the author's face. ``Is that an oxymoron?''
he wondered during a recent interview in New York. For this
41-year-old Canadian, his birthplace _ a former British colony and
since 1949 a province of Canada _ ``may not be big, but the
struggle is heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The Great Newfoundland Novel is like the Great
American Novel, it never will exist. It's just something to shoot
for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Newfoundland the label would imply that the book
is only for people from that place. As reviewers in the United
States and Canada have realized, anyone can enjoy it, even those
without a knowledge of the province's history or those who
mispronounce its name. It's noo-fund-LAND.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colony of Unrequited Dreams'' (Doubleday) is the first of
Johnston's five books to be published in the United States.
Recently it was followed by his third, ``The Divine Ryans.'' (The
movie version, with a screenplay by the author, is scheduled to
open soon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Colony'' is by far the longest and most ambitious of his
works. A contemporary historical novel, it is the richly layered
story of two outsiders in a remote land searching for its identity.
With some of the feeling of a 19th-century novel, it captures both
the beauty and the bleakness of this island off the coast of
Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist and narrator is a real person, Joe Smallwood,
the first premier of Newfoundland when it became a Canadian
province. Smallwood was born in 1900, and the book spans most of
the 20th century. To American readers he is as unknown as any
governor of a small state during his period, but he was a pivotal
figure in the history of his country. As Johnston said, ``When I
was growing up, he was a legend, an incredibly dynamic character.''
</P>
<P>
   A failure as a young journalist, Smallwood eventually became a
highly successful politician and a leader of the movement to join
the Canadian confederacy. In his early days as a labor organizer
and politician, he walked across Newfoundland, visiting every
railroad outpost along the way, and then he walked back home. It
took him more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an amazing accomplishment,'' Johnston said, and it
endeared him to the public. ``The character in the book has an epic
sense of the world and of himself as he struggles to live up to it.
That's why I find Smallwood to be so emblematic of Newfoundland:
this sense of near nationhood, near everything. If one or two
things had been different, it could have made it as a country. That
sense of loss lives on in the people who live there.'' The
fictional Smallwood's first words are, ``I am a Newfoundlander,'' a
conscious emulation of the first line of ``The Adventures of Augie
March,'' in which Saul Bellow's title character begins, ``I am an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said that his Smallwood was true to the basic facts,
with one notable exception: the character of Shelagh Fielding, the
woman who shadows him throughout the book and is for a long time
his unacknowledged love. Fielding, as she is called, is an vivid
and independent woman, and she almost walks away with the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Smallwood and Fielding are friends _ and have been rivals _
since their childhood, when they were involved in an episode that
haunts them all their lives. Something similar happens in ``Fifth
Business,'' by Robertson Davies, a fellow Canadian to whom Johnston
has been compared. In common their novels deal with tumultuous,
often comic events in the lives of colorful characters.
</P>
<P>
   Physically and temperamentally, Smallwood and Fielding are
opposites. He is an incarnation of his name: small, wiry and often
a Zelig-like apparition in other people's lives. (Johnston said
that at a certain age Woody Allen would have been perfect casting
for a film.) Fielding is tall and somewhat ungainly, and as a kind
of signature carries a cane. She is bold and outspoken, a skeptic
in contrast to his role as a soapbox orator. Her character is
inspired by several people in Smallwood's life and also by her
namesake, Henry Fielding. As in Fielding's ``Tom Jones,'' her wry
commentary, and her condensed history of Newfoundland, enlivens the
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a voice to balance Smallwood,'' Johnston said, ``and
Fielding was a bit of a gift.'' One night while working he looked
at a photograph in an encyclopedia, a picture of the graduating
class in a girl's school in the early part of this century. A
student in the back row had ``a very evocative look.'' That was the
first image for Fielding, and he kept the book open to that page
while he created the character.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's interest in Smallwood began when he was a teenager in
a tiny town outside St. Johns. As a student at Roman Catholic
schools, he was encouraged to become a priest. (``The Divine
Ryans'' is about a family of priests and undertakers.) ``I have a
lot in common with Smallwood,'' he said. ``I wasn't as poor as he
was, but we were poor and moved from house to house as he did.''
Although they both loved Newfoundland, each also had an antipathy
to the North Atlantic, which is so much a part of local life.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Memorial University of Newfoundland,
Johnston worked as a reporter on a small newspaper in St. Johns.
One of his assignments was to go on a seal hunt, which led him many
years later to write a harrowing passage in ``Colony,'' recreating
a historical incident in which 87 sealers died after being stranded
on an ice floe.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the local courts, he met Smallwood, who by that time
had retired from office. Because Johnston mentioned him in an
article, Smallwood excoriated him in the courthouse: ``He was quite
short, and he pretty much stood on my feet. He looked up at me and
said, `I have written for newspapers in London, New York, Boston
and Halifax, and I've never read such drivel.' And it was only from
mentioning his name in a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Were he alive today, would he stand on the author's feet and
criticize the book? ``I think he would love the attention,'' he
said. ``Even that tantrum was for public consumption. A novel about
him? He would have loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnston published his first book when he was 26, and since then
has been a full-time novelist. He moved to Toronto, where he lives
with his wife, but he still keeps close contact with Newfoundland.
In preparation for ``Colony'' he followed his subject's path to New
York, where Smallwood spent several years writing for periodicals
and giving speeches in Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Late in writing the novel Johnston thought of two key words for
use in his title: colony and unrequited, and played around with
variations of both while also considering other possibilities,
beginning with ``100 Years of Solitude.'' Of course, that title was
already taken, but there was something in it suggestive of his
grand theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like books that are consciously written in the knowledge
that North America is the New World, books like `The Great
Gatsby,''' he said. ``I always loved the last pages where he's
talking about how the shore must have looked when the Dutch sailors
first saw it.'' He also loved the title of V.S. Naipaul's book
``The Enigma of Arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I wrote about Newfoundland as part of the New
World,'' he said. ``Though it's the oldest colony in North America,
it's an undiscovered new place where you have to build your culture
from the ground up.''
</P>
<P>
   As Smallwood says in ``Colony,'' it seemed to be ``a landlocked
country in the middle of an otherwise empty continent,'' an
``unfoundland,'' at least until Johnston wrote his novel.

   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Dr. R.S. Puri sees the Internet as the future
of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old internal-medicine physician is banking on it.
</P>
<P>
   Puri and 17 other Florida doctors have collectively invested $1
million to start DoctorSurf.com, a Web site designed by doctors to
provide information to doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   The private company also is one of the first in the nation given
permission by the Securities and Exchange Commission to give away
SEC-registered shares on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and dentists who sign up with the company are given
100 free shares for providing information about themselves for the
site. The free stock offering will be given to the first 250,000
doctors, which will total 25 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to get physicians interested in the site, which will
receive continual funding through pharmaceutical companies that
will advertise products on the site.
</P>
<P>
   DoctorSurf.com is up and running, though aspects of it are still
being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Puri said the site will provide a variety of information written
by doctors, including new medical research and studies on various
diseases. Members will be able to link to medical journals, medical
schools, hospitals and health-care organizations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the future. That is the way we see it,'' said
Puri, a physician in Lakeland for 25 years and one of three vice
presidents for DoctorSurf.com. ``Companies are selling groceries on
the Internet and this is far better than groceries. There is a
tremendous need for information and the right kind of information.
We define this as an informational highway for doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The public also can use the Web site to obtain free information.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be able to log onto the site and get research
information on what is happening in medicine from around the
world,'' Puri said.

 &HT;    November sweeps brings ``Buffy'' and ``Angel'' together again
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before Buffy the Vampire Slayer got
back with Angel, her vampire ex-lover. Actually, it was only a
matter of timing, of waiting for November sweeps and maximum
ratings bang for the buck.
</P>
<P>
   The two parted in May, soulmates who had to face the problem
that only one of them had a soul. Angel spun off to his own series,
Buffy went off to college, and the WB got two hot shows from what
used to be one.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's super-duper-double crossover brings Angel back to
Sunnydale, Buffy's stomping and staking grounds, and then Buffy
(Sarah Michelle Gellar) goes to Los Angeles to help Angel (David
Boreanaz), in the more satisfying of the two episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Buffy'' lead-off is typically fun but not spectacular. The
gang is trying to whip up Thanksgiving dinner, only to have a new
building on campus disturb a Native American burial grounds, which
summons forth a warrior spirit bent on avenging the white man's
genocide. Needless to say, lumps in the mashed potatoes soon become
the least of everyone's worries.
</P>
<P>
   There's a stronger than usual comedy quota (getting the magic
potion mixed up with the stuffing recipe, etc.) But this is served
up regularly on ``Buffy'' _ the true fans are going to be panting
for an encounter between the heroine and her hunky, broody beloved,
and they won't get it in ``Buffy'' _ Angel just lurks in the
shadows keeping an eye on her, helping out behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   They'll get more than they hoped for in ``Angel,'' however,
which follows on the events of ``Buffy'' but takes them in a new
direction. Buffy finds out Angel was tailing her and goes to L.A.
to tell him she's a big girl now and doesn't need him to play Mr.
Protector. Just as they're deciding yet again that no matter how
strong their attraction, their love will always be thwarted, along
comes another in the endless supply of demons with magical powers
and changes Angel from a vampire back to a human.
</P>
<P>
   As fans know (and if you're not a fan already, these intensive
episodes are not the place to start), this removes the obstacle to
their love, and pretty soon B&AMP;A are making up for lost time in a
scene involving rumpled bedsheets and chocolate ice cream that will
have ``Buff''-sters palpitating on the Internet for days to come.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Angel'' fans also know, if you take away his
torment-of-the-undead bit, you invalidate the whole premise for the
show, and that won't do; the natural order must be restored. And
doing that, of course, means returning Buffy and Angel to their
star-crossed state, sad as it may be.
</P>
<P>
   So in two hours, you've got dinner, demons, dessert, sex,

 &HT;    `Run Like a Girl' gives young women a sporting chance
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high school girls are so covered in mud they are truly one
with the earth. Playing rugby on a soaked and well-churned field,
they run hard, tackle harder, yell ``Take her down!'' with the
gusto of Marines at boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohmigod, it felt so good!'' gushes a 16-year-old with a
mouthful of braces afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for ``Run Like a Girl,'' a new public television
documentary by Atlanta filmmaker Carol Cassidy: It never goes where
you think it will. Although it focuses on girls playing sports,
there's no mention of the ones we read about all the time: soccer,
basketball, tennis. And although it's all about societal
expectations and the psychology of adolescents, there isn't a
single statistic, nor a single expert's psycho-babble.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting girls's stories
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy, a former CNN producer, is now an independent filmmaker;
``Run Like a Girl'' is part of her ``American Girls'' trilogy,
which also includes ``Baby Love'' and ``Smile Pretty.'' She's
collected the stories of all the girls she's documented into a new
book, ``Girls in America: Their Stories, Their Words,'' just out
from TV Books.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rugby, ``Run'' also spends time with synchronized
swimmers and double-dutch jump-ropers, both of which face an uphill
battle to be acknowledged as real sports. But the hours they put
in, their self-discipline and sense of achievement count for vast
amounts no matter what you call their activities.
</P>
<P>
   The girls play hard, and talk with great candor. ``They hit him
in the head with a hammer,'' a young jump-roper says of a young
friend who got caught up with gangs. ``I hope I won't be like that.
But I don't know.'' A swimmer talks about earlier bouts of
self-mutilation, and a rugby player nervously gets dressed up for
the school dance.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Reviving Ophelia'' from the point of view of the girls
themselves: ``Ophelia Kicks Butt.'' And it's a strong antidote to
that lingering, queasy feeling so many people had after watching
the ennui-driven sex of ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Like a Girl.''

LAWMAKERS SAY FAA'S TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM WILL BE READY FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's air traffic control system will be
ready for the year 2000, lawmakers on the House Y2K task force said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also reported that the vast majority of the
federal government's computers have been fixed and tested to
properly interpret Jan. 1, 2000. If computers are not fixed they
may misread the year 2000 as 1900 and fail, a potential problem
dubbed ``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic control system
wasn't fully ready for the year 2000 as of Nov. 15 but Rep. Connie
Morella, R-Md., the task force's co-chairman, said she fully
expects the FAA to be ready by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the FAA ranked in the ``not ready'' category is
because the agency hasn't finished testing some systems that
connect with the air traffic control system such as weather
forecasting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has to worry about getting on a plane,'' Morella said.
``Planes will not fly if it's not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., the task force's other co-chair,
said he is so confident in the air traffic control system that he
plans to fly on Dec. 31 from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.

   Many airlines have canceled some flights Dec. 31 and Jan. 1
because of a lack of demand. The Air Transport Association (ATA), a
Washington-based trade association that represents large airlines,
said the lower-than-normal flight bookings have little to do with
fears that people may have about flying on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been told they have to work and can't go
anywhere,'' said Thomas Browne, executive director of the ATA's
aviation millenium project. In cases where people are travelling,
Browne said they are leaving earlier and staying later than usual
to comply with minimum stays that many hotels have implemented for
the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we don't see any reason why people shouldn't
fly,'' Browne said. ``(Air traffic control) testing has been going
on for many, many months.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA administrator Jane Garvey has repeatedly told Congress that
the FAA's computer systems are ready. Last month she told a Senate
Y2K task force that the agency is continuing to test and retest
computer systems, including air traffic control. Earlier this year
FAA moved air traffic control's clocks ahead to Dec. 31, 1999, and
flew a test flight from Grand Junction, Colo. to Denver without
incident.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when Texas is gaining notoriety for
leading the nation in toxic emissions, state regulators are
collecting fewer and fewer environmental fines, records show. Fines
collected from polluters during fiscal 1999 have hit a seven-year
low, figures from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission show. Many environmentalists say the downward trend
reflects lax enforcement by the administration of Gov. George W.
Bush and a disturbing coziness with the industries that the
commission regulates, an allegation that state officials dispute.

 &HT;    AS CLINTON HEADS TO SITE OF HIS RISKIEST FOREIGN POLICY VENTURE,
KOSOVO STILL SMOLDERS WITH ETHNIC STRIFE

<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Journeying to the heart of last spring's
Balkan nightmare, President Clinton goes Tuesday to Kosovo to
address its beleaguered citizens and buck up the spirits of
American troops struggling to enforce a fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be briefed on the deeply troubled allied mission to
knit the war-ravaged province back together and will host a
Thanksgiving week dinner for U.S. soldiers during his eight-hour
visit.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to appeal to majority ethnic Albanians to stop the
violent retribution against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks against Serbs have threatened NATO and United Nations
efforts in Kosovo, where Clinton led the West in spring air strikes
to counter a bloody campaign of Serb repression and terror
targeting Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make a very strong statement about the importance of
everybody getting over this ethnic hatred and going beyond it,''
Clinton told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all made a big commitment to Kosovo and its economic
and political reconstruction,'' Clinton said. ``But I think it's
very important that Kosovo, in effect, not become the mirror image
of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to seven years of attacks by Serbs against
non-Serbs in nearby Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, as well as
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of bolstering the political opponents of Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, Clinton held out
the promise Monday of large scale U.S. aid to Serbia _ but only if
Milosevic gives up power in Belgrade. Serbia is Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with war crimes by a U.N. tribunal, Milosevic has shown
no sign of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touted Bulgaria, a former Soviet satellite state, as a
model of the sort of democratic and ethnically tolerant nation that
is slowly changing the face of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your neighbor, Serbia, should be part of that bright and
different future,'' Clinton said in an address to more than 20,000
people jammed into Sofia's historic Nevski Square, an hour's drive
from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told that during the recent war you could actually hear
some of the bombs falling in Serbia from this square,'' Clinton
said, his breath showing misty in the chilled night air. ``Tonight,
I hope the people of Serbia can hear our voices when we say, if you
choose as Bulgaria has chosen, you will regain the rightful place
in Europe Mr. Milosevic has stolen from you, and America will help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit here amounted to a badly needed vote of
confidence for Bulgaria. Once one of the Soviet Union's most
reliable client states, Bulgaria is staggering through a bold if
uneven 10-year march from communist totalitarianism to free-market
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that journey has left Bulgaria stranded at the eastern
edge of the Balkans. Already one of the poorest nations in Europe _
with per capita income barely reaching $1,500 per year _ Bulgaria
has been further strangled by the war in Yugoslavia, through which
most of Bulgaria's international trade must flow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's National Security Advisor, Samuel Berger, said
Milosevic is preventing the United States from helping to clear the
Danube River of a half-dozen bridges dropped by NATO warplanes
during 78 days of air strikes last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The bridges have left the Danube _ the main trade artery linking
the Balkans to Central Europe _ impassable through Serbia. The
condition is wreaking economic havoc on countries like Bulgaria,
Romania and Macedonia. All depend heavily upon Danube connections
for imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to clear the Danube,'' Berger said. Milosevic,
though, has said NATO countries may only help clear the bridges if
they also rebuild them, Berger said, adding ``That's not something
we're prepared to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Clinton's agenda Tuesday will be meetings with the
allied civilian and military leaders that are administering Kosovo
_ Bernard Kouchner, the special U.N. representative for civilian
operations and German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, commander of the 41,000
troops, 6,300 of them Americans, making up the U.N. peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to meet with Albanian leaders Ibrahim
Rugova and Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, as well as Kosovo's highest Serb religious authority, Serb
Orthodox Bishop Artimije.
</P>
<P>
   The troops and humanitarian aid workers moved in last June,
following NATO air strikes. The campaign was waged to halt the
abuse of ethnic Albanians by Serbs, who are estimated to have
killed up to 10,000 Albanians while forcing more than 1.2 million
others to flee their homes and take refuge in the mountains of
Kosovo or beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after the NATO victory, though, the allied operation
there is listing badly:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Albanians seeking revenge have killed scores of ethnic Serbs
and intimidated and terrorized thousands more. Berger estimated
that as many as three in four of the 200,000 Serbs that call Kosovo
home have fled the province.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While nearly 900,000 Albanian refugees have returned home,
hundreds of thousands lack basic housing. Aid workers are rushing
in plastic sheeting and plywood, in hopes of providing every family
at least one weather-proofed room before the harsh Balkan winter
sets in over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money promised by the West for peacekeeping and reconstruction
in Kosovo has fallen far short of pledges. As a result, a broad
array of programs, from training local police to restoring water
and electricity, has been slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The problems were largely anticipated, U.S. officials said
Monday, but they are problems just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who saw the way the refugees, some 800,000, were
unceremoniously dumped out of railroad cars into the mud on the
borders of neighboring Macedonia and Albania understood there was
going to be a real problem trying to reconcile Serbs and Albanians
after that,'' said special White House envoy Christopher Hill, who
oversees Balkan matters for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we've got a lot further to go with Kosovo,'' said
Hill, who has spent most of the past decade working on U.S. policy
in Kosovo, Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with these problems in the Balkans, I mean, it's
like you're pounding some warped floorboards,'' Hill said. ``You
get one down and another one pops up somewhere, so you've got to
work with that one.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am refinishing some tables and other furniture with a
clear, high gloss varnish and I have trouble with small ``misses''
on large flat surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   I try to work carefully as I apply several coats of the clear
varnish, sanding lightly between coats. But it is very hard to tell
if I have accidentally skipped a small spot _ until after the
varnish dries. Then I have to do that surface over again.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion as to how this can be avoided on future jobs?
</P>
<P>
   A: One way to spot such misses or skips while the varnish is
still wet is to shine a bright light across the surface from a low
angle as shown here. Then look over the surface carefully from the
opposite direction, also from a low angle.
</P>
<P>
   The wet varnish will look shiny and reflect the light _ but any
missed or dry spots that have not been coated will show up as dull
areas that are clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently noticed mildew on the vinyl wallpaper in my
bathroom. This was an expensive vinyl, so I would like to clean it,
rather than replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any product I can use to clean this wallpaper without
damaging it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since you have a vinyl wallcovering, rather than a regular
wallpaper, you should be able to scrub it without harm. However,
some of these materials are more resistant to scrubbing than
others, so you should test in a small area first.
</P>
<P>
   There are mildew removing solutions sold in most home centers,
or you can use a solution of one part liquid laundry bleach mixed
with five parts water. If the stains are really mildew this should
remove them without need for scrubbing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the mildew remover may also affect the
colors in some cases, so test each product first on a scrap piece
of the same material before using it on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We use a roller when painting walls and ceilings with latex
paint, but we find that washing all the paint out of the roller
cover is always difficult.
</P>
<P>
   We prefer a top quality roller cover because this gives us a
smoother job, so we don't want to throw the cover away after each
use. However, getting it thoroughly clean it is a real problem.
</P>
<P>
   What suggestions can you offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Start by squeezing most of the paint out of the roller with
your fingers (wear a disposable plastic glove if you wish).
</P>
<P>
   Then roll the cover repeatedly over a stack of old newspapers,
discarding the top sheet as soon as it becomes saturated with
paint.
</P>
<P>
   When no more paint comes out slide the cover off and wash it in
soap and water. Rinse with lots of clean water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The fabric-like wallpaper in my kitchen is pulling away from
the wall along the seams in several places.
</P>
<P>
   I tried fixing it with ordinary wallpaper paste, but this
doesn't seem to hold for long.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me what else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to use one of the ready mixed vinyl
adhesives that are sold for use in hanging vinyl wallcoverings.
</P>
<P>
   There are special seam-sealers that come in small squeeze tubes
and are specifically formulated for use on seams that have pulled
loose.
</P>
<P>
   If the old wallcovering is stiff and doesn't bend easily when
you try to lay it flat, wet the back of the fabric down with water
first.
</P>
<P>

STEVE ALLEN  WRITES MUSICAL `CHRISTMAS CAROL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Not for use before Wednesday, Nov. 24) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom)  
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; There have been great ``Christmas Carols'' and deadly
``Christmas Carols,'' high-tech productions at Madison Square
Garden and thrift-shop productions in suburban church basements.
</P>
<P>
   But there had never been a musical version of Charles Dickens'
timeless holiday parable. Or so Steve Allen briefly considered when
he decided to sit down and write one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me one of the best ideas that I had ever had,''
says Allen, whose tuneful adaptation of Dickens' seasonal classic
will have its world premiere tonight at Theatre West, across from
Universal City. ``I could not believe, however, that I was the
first to ever think of it _ and indeed I was not.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that a bunch of overqualified Brits, including
Albert Finney and Alec Guinness, had beaten Allen to the punch with
the 1970 musical feature film ``Scrooge.'' Released in the
Oscar-winning wake of ``Oliver!'' _ another Dickens novel turned
musical property _ ``Scrooge'' is memorable today mainly for the
image of Finney romping through faux-Victorian streets warbling
``Thank You Very Much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't there room for another try?
</P>
<P>
   There was, and now Allen has written 17 songs for it with titles
such as ``We Are One,'' ``Greed'' and a pull-out-the-hankies number
called ``God Bless Us Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me there had to be a song sung by dear little
Tiny Tim called `God Bless Us Everyone,' because that's the
best-known line,'' says Allen. ``Fortunately, Dickens is easily
accessible. You can take chunks of conversation just as written.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring as world-class skinflint Ebenezer Scrooge will be
Harold Gould, the five-time Emmy nominated actor (``Rhoda,'' ``The
Golden Girls'') who recently starred in the Pasadena Playhouse
production of ``Visiting Mr. Green.'' Allen will appear onstage at
most performances as Charles Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   A prodigious actor, composer and author of 53 books, and the man
who created and first hosted ``The Tonight Show,'' Allen has led
popular culture more often than he has followed it. At 78 he still
puts in a full seven days of work, either at his Encino home or his
Van Nuys-based Meadowlane Enterprises (named for his wife, actress
Jayne Meadows), where he keeps a handful of hard-working assistants
on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing songs comes easily to Allen, so easily that he composed
one of his major hits, ``This Could Be the Start of Something
Big,'' in his sleep (he says the song came to him in a dream).
Officially, he's the world's most prolific songwriter, with more
than 8,000 composing credits, including ``Impossible.'' You can
look it up in the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hide the point?'' he says evenly. ``I can write beautiful
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Allen, once called ``the most talented man in America'' by
no less a multifaceted talent than Noel Coward, makes no particular
claims for what he refers to as his ``freakish'' musical aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have understanding of it. I don't even read music.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he take credit for having any special new insights into
``A Christmas Carol's'' enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Dickens scholar,'' he says. ``I'm not a scholar of
any kind. In fact I never even graduated from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly credentials or no, Allen is happy to chat about his
new show in relation to, say, the social theories of Metternich and
Marx or the formation of the modern welfare state. He believes that
``the question of what the rich should do about the poor, in fact,
(is) more with us today in some ways than it was when (Dickens) was
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has to do something (to assist the needy),'' he
says. ``That's just common sense. But common sense isn't very
common.''

LITTLE LIBRARY ON THE OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (lb) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Laura Ingalls Wilder Library was named after the favorite
daughter of Mansfield, Mo., who wore her best velvet dress to the
dedication ceremony in 1951. But today the little library, about a
half-block from the town square, looks forlorn. The roof leaks.
Foam insulation is taped to the windows of the concrete building to
keep out the frost. Library employees shiver in their coats through
the icy Ozark winters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the library is turning to the courts, and the will of
Wilder, its hometown author, in hopes of bringing in a rare source
of income that could be used for repairs and enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   The last wishes of Wilder, who wrote the ``Little House'' book
series, are among the issues at the heart of a simmering federal
court battle, with the library claiming that it has been cheated of
the income from the author's lucrative literary estate. By one
estimate at least $100 million could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The library is encountering stiff resistance from the publisher
HarperCollins and from the heir of Roger Lea MacBride, whose
lawyers said Wilder's daughter bequeathed rights to him. Court
papers filed by MacBride's estate said that the daughter, Rose
Wilder Lane, properly bequeathed certain copyrights, like renewals,
to MacBride.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the library contend in a suit filed in U.S. District
Court in Springfield, Mo., that the intent of Wilder's 1952 will
was thwarted by her daughter, who died in 1968 with no children or
surviving husband.
</P>
<P>
   They say the will stipulates that the library receive all
royalties from Wilder's 11 copyrighted works after her daughter's
death. MacBride, who died in 1995 and was a longtime friend of
Lane, augmented the ``Little House'' series with his own works and
helped create the popular television series based on the ``Little
House'' books.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers the library maintains that MacBride
``successfully perpetuated the myth of his relationship'' as Lane's
adopted grandson and the guardian of Wilder's estate.
</P>
<P>
   After Lane died, MacBride gained control of Wilder's estate by
transferring and renewing expiring copyrights in his name and
applying for new copyrights for Wilder's unpublished books, the
library asserts in its complaint.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday lawyers for the defendants fought back in court.
They asked the judge to toss out the case, saying that the
library's claims were unfounded and that the renewal rights were
handled properly. They also say that under a three-year statute of
limitations the library waited too long to bring its case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for HarperCollins said the library should have acted
after receiving its one and only royalty check, for $28,011.05,
from Wilder's publisher in 1972. The library's complaint leaves it
to the judge whether a distinction should be drawn between the
books that were published before Wilder's death and the books,
adaptations and spinoffs produced after she died.
</P>
<P>
   The library asked the judge, Ortrie Smith, to determine what the
Wilder estate is worth. It is seeking unspecified damages from
MacBride's estate; from his daughter, Abigail MacBride Allen of
Virginia; and from HarperCollins, publisher of the ``Little House''
series.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder's writings fueled an immense empire that included the hit
television series ``Little House on the Prairie,'' starring Michael
Landon and Melissa Gilbert, which ran from 1974 to 1983 on NBC and
was seen in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a vast array of products, including cookbooks,
friendship bracelets and calendars _ merchandise that the lawsuit
said was described by a HarperCollins senior editor as ``our best
property.'' Two years ago Universal Studios acquired the rights to
make a movie based on the ``Little House'' books, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose in the spring when library volunteers in
Mansfield, a dairy-farming community of 1,400 in the southern part
of the state, were preparing to apply for grants to pay for
improvements at the Wright County system's three branch libraries
and asked Harold Glass, its lawyer, to review Wilder's will.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Cline, the director of the library system, said that
until then people assumed that the library had gotten its fair
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if they discovered that they had the rights to an
unpublished Shakespeare play; it's that valuable,'' said Stan
Soocher, an entertainment lawyer who is editor in chief of the
Entertainment Law and Finance newsletter, based in New York. He
calculated that Wilder's estate is worth at least $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder died in 1957, but she remains a strong, abiding presence.
Her home, which is a museum in Mansfield, receives about 50,000
visitors a year from around the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilder was born in 1867 into a farm family in rural Wisconsin
that traveled and endured hardships throughout the Midwest. After
she married Almanzo Wilder and gave birth to Rose, they traveled by
covered wagon to Mansfield in 1894.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wilder became a renowned children's author, her
daughter had made a name for herself as a journalist. Wilder, in
fact, was encouraged by her daughter to begin writing books based
on her hardscrabble frontier childhood. Wilder was 65 in 1932 when
her first book, ``Little House in the Big Woods,'' was published.
</P>
<P>
   After Wilder's daughter died at age 81 in Connecticut, MacBride
took over the management of the Wilder oeuvre. Starting in 1969 he
began renewing copyrights of Wilder's books and applying for new
ones for her unpublished books in the names of MacBride and his
lawyers, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that MacBride used an unspecified amount
of money from the royalties of Wilder's books to finance his failed
presidential bid as the Libertarian candidate in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was an adherent of the laissez-faire objectivist philosophy
of the novelist Ayn Rand and had adopted MacBride as a political
disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University, said
the case may be settled, because it is so ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The library has a stronger claim to revenues from books
published before Wilder's death, he said, but the entire matter is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be close,'' Rothstein said.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ In the mid-1980s, Michael Corda, a 26-year-old native
of Nicaragua, was working for a shipping company in Houston when
the bottom fell out of the oil industry. Corda had always loved to
cook, so he took his severance package and in 1988 started a
restaurant called Churrascos in a dumpy neighborhood in Houston.
Much as its name implies, it was like a traditional Argentine
steakhouse, but with a contemporary flair.
 &HT;    Despite good reviews, including a crowd-bringing boost from
Texas Monthly, the restaurant was losing money, and Corda was ready
to throw in his apron after only four months. But then fate
intervened. The wife of a prominent banker in Houston, Fred Smith
of First National Bank, happened to eat at his restaurant and
encouraged her husband to try it. Smith was so impressed that after
his meal he gave Corda his card. ``If you're thinking of expanding,
call me,'' Corda remembers him saying.
 &HT;    Cash-strapped Corda did and he's never looked back. He now has
two Churrascos in Houston and a more elaborate eatery near the
ritzy Galleria called Americas. He's planning to open another
Churrascos in San Antonio sometime this fall and perhaps one in
Phoenix after that. His plan is to eventually roll out the concept
nationwide.
 &HT;    Corda was one of the early pioneers of so-called ``Nuevo
Latino'' cuisine, which is taking the U.S. by fork. Restaurants
serving this Latin American-food-with-an-attitude are popping up
all over the country, from New York (Orinoco, Sonora and Calle
Ocho) to Chicago (Brio, Mas and Nacional) to the West Coast (Vinga
in San Francisco and Oba! in Portland).
 &HT;    ``It's a bonafide trend,'' says John F. Mariani, a noted
restaurant critic at Esquire magazine and author of ``The
Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink: More Than 2,000
Definitions and Descriptions of American Classics''
(Lebhar-Friedman Books, November 1999). ``Some of it has to do
solely with the fact that the Hispanic population of the United
States is increasing enormously. You've (also) got some real smart
Latinos who are doing it.''
 &HT;    Mariani says Nuevo Latino cuisine actually grew out of a
movement started in Miami in the late 1980s called New Caribbean,
or Floribbean, which featured meats and fish sunnied up with citrus
and exotic Caribbean fruits like mangoes, passion fruit and guava
and served with rice and beans. Its originators were mostly
non-Latinos, including Mark Militello at Mark's Place, Norman Van
Aken at Louis' Backyard and Robin Haas at The Colony.
 &HT;    But like many trendy food styles, its popularity started to
wane. So in the early 1990s, restaurateurs many of whom were Latin
American started reaching farther south for recipes and
ingredients.
 &HT;    One of them was Douglas Rodriguez. Part of the New Florida scene
at Yuca in Miami, the first-generation Cuban-American eventually
moved his show to New York City, opening the crowd-pleasing Patria
in 1994. Popular restaurant guide Zagat Survey currently includes
it as one of its top 50 restaurants in New York, calling it
``estupendo.'' ``Douglas Rodriguez whips up some of New York's most
exciting' food,'' its review says. ``Every bite is an explosion' of
flavors from dishes presented with flair.''' Rodriguez even went on
to write a cookbook called ``Nuevo Latino: Recipes that Celebrate
the New Latin American Cuisine'' (Ten Speed Press, 1995).
 &HT;    Esquire's Mariani says the most exciting chef on the scene right
now is Guillermo Pernot, who recently opened Pasion! in
Philadelphia. Pernot, who hails from Argentina, cut his teeth at
Gloria Estefan's Allioli on Miami Beach and Vega Grill in Manayunk,
Pennsylvania. His specialties include smoked chicken and corn
quesadillas with tomatillo pico de gallo, tamal cubano with a
watercress and scallion salad and barbecued pork with boniato
pancakes. It's not cheap, either: Dinner can set you back $80 per
person.
 &HT;    Despite many newcomers' entrance on the scene, many credit the
40-year-old Corda with ushering this Latin American cuisine to the
forefront, executing it flawlessly and with panache. Corda learned
to appreciate Latin American cooking from his mother, whose
specialties were simple dishes like `arroz con pollo' and `gallo
pinto,' a variation on the traditional Nicaraguan meal of rice and
beans. When he moved to College Station to attend Texas A&AMP;M
University in 1976, the closest thing he could find to Latin
American dining was Taco Bell. So he started cooking for his
roommates and friends. His first dish was a flop: He tried to fry
beans in oil to make refried beans. The only problem was that he
hadn't boiled the beans first.
 &HT;    His first restaurant also looked like it was going to be a
disaster. But after his encounter with First National Bank's Smith,
Corda invited him and his loan officer to the restaurant, where he
made a presentation and served them some of his best dishes. After
that, he snagged a $250,000 loan. Corda used that money to open a
second Churrascos closer to downtown. As with the first location,
it took a while to catch on. But once word got out, the restaurant
took off.
 &HT;    Then came his real taste of success. In July 1993, he opened
Americas, a souped-up version of Churrascos with Indian-inspired
decor on the inside (``looks like it was done by Picasso on
drugs,'' one reviewer said) and daring food on the plate, such as
taquitos filled with bacon-wrapped quail, mushrooms and chiles,
giant shrimp sauteed with cachaca-laced butter, and, to top it off,
dulce de arroz asturiano, a rice-pudding souffle in a carmelized
coconut basket. Mariani was so impressed, he included it as the top
new restaurant in the November issue of Esquire in 1993. After
that, foodies flooded in.
 &HT;    Despite the acclaim Corda has received, he's taken his lumps,
too. A Churrascos he opened in Chicago in 1997 to rave reviews
closed down after eight months when a local operating partner
backed out. He lost something in the six figures. And a line of
dips and plantains he developed for sale in supermarkets a few
years ago has never really taken off.
 &HT;    But Corda keeps creating new ideas and concepts. In November, he
plans to take Nuevo Latino cuisine downscale a bit with a new
Houston restaurant called the Amazon Grill. Diners will be able to
feast on some of the same food they enjoy at Churrascos and
Americas, but at more like $7 to $10 per entree. One of the
highlights: Instead of a salad bar, it will feature a sauce bar
with 18 different concoctions, from chimichurri, an olive
oil-and-cilantro pesto, to a coconut milk sauce. ``We want to bring
Latin cuisine to the masses,'' he says.
 &HT;    What advice would Corda give to other Latin Americans looking to
open shop in the U.S.? Do not renounce your roots, he says. ``We
can learn from the American experience,'' he says. ``But we have to
find the beauty of our culture and share it with Americans.'' Corda
certainly has.

OUTPOURING OF CONCERN FOR CHARLES SCHULZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE LAUER   
 Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Just as Charlie Brown counts on his
``Peanuts'' cohorts for help in his numerous encounters with
misfortune, Charles Schulz is reaping the support of community and
colleagues after being diagnosed with colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're incredibly saddened, but I also know Sparky has a lot of
fight in him,'' said David Wiley Miller, creator of the cartoon
``Non Sequitur'' and longtime of Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what to do or say in situations like this,''
he said. ``You feel so damn helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family are rallying around Schulz, hoping he'll
bounce back, just as his alter ego, Charlie Brown, has for the past
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   After emergency surgery last week, Schulz, who turns 77 on
Friday, is up and walking at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital. His
prognosis has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Mollie Boice, an actress and another longtime friend, said
Schulz is a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a veteran,'' Boice said. ``I know he fought in the Second
World War. Hopefully, he'll be fighting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Boice said Schulz has a wide spectrum of people pulling for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who just really love him _ a lot of
very different people. Sparky is very eclectic in the people he
likes and connects with _ doctors, veterinarians, people who sell
furniture. Anybody who piqued his interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next several weeks, new adventures of Charlie Brown and
``Peanuts'' will continue to appear in 2,600 newspapers around the
world. Schulz, like many daily cartoonists, works weeks in advance.
But beyond that, the cartoon's future is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a good time for him to retire,'' said Miller.
``He took his first vacation in years this year and papers ran old
strips. He hated it, I know, but maybe now is the time to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no replacing Sparky in the cartoon world,''
Miller said. ``You don't replace a Mozart. You don't replace a
Michelangelo, but you have to realize that everything has to end.
`Peanuts' will be gone someday but his impact on the art form will
never go away. His work was too important. He broke a lot of
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, nicknamed Sparky, was moved out of Memorial's
intensive-care unit Friday and has been visiting with his wife and
five children. The family is continuing to ask that Schulz have no
other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent surgery last Tuesday to clear a blockage of the
abdominal aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the lower
body, his wife, Jean, has said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz settled in Santa Rosa, which is about 50 miles north of
San Francisco, more than 40 years ago. He is an athletic man who
plays ice hockey, tennis and golf. He last endured a serious health
crisis in 1981 when he underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his drawing board not long after. His daily
routine for decades has been to start the day at his reserved table
in the cafe at Snoopy's Redwood Empire Ice Arena, which he had
built in 1969, and then walk to his nearby studio and resume
drawing the world's most popular comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked half a day last Tuesday when he lay down on a
couch, telling employees that he didn't feel good and his legs
hurt. He was rushed by ambulance to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer that surgeons discovered is a type that occurs 90
percent of the time in people older than 50, according to the
Cancer Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although colon cancer is the second-leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the nation, survival rates have risen over
the past two decades because treatments have improved and a higher
percentage of cases have been detected early.

 &HT;    HOUSTON _ In the mid-1980s, Michael Corda, a 26-year-old native
of Nicaragua, was working for a shipping company in Houston when
the bottom fell out of the oil industry. Corda had always loved to

Much as its name implies, it was like a traditional Argentine
steakhouse, but with a contemporary flair.
 &HT;    Despite good reviews, including a crowd-bringing boost from
Texas Monthly, the restaurant was losing money, and Corda was ready
to throw in his apron after only four months. But then fate
intervened. The wife of a prominent banker in Houston, Fred Smith
of First National Bank, happened to eat at his restaurant and
encouraged her husband to try it. Smith was so impressed that after
his meal he gave Corda his card. ``If you're thinking of expanding,
call me,'' Corda remembers him saying.
 &HT;    Cash-strapped Corda did and he's never looked back. He now has
two Churrascos in Houston and a more elaborate eatery near the
ritzy Galleria called Americas. He's planning to open another
Churrascos in San Antonio sometime this fall and perhaps one in
Phoenix after that. His plan is to eventually roll out the concept
nationwide.
 &HT;    Corda was one of the early pioneers of so-called ``Nuevo
Latino'' cuisine, which is taking the U.S. by fork. Restaurants
serving this Latin American-food-with-an-attitude are popping up
all over the country, from New York (Orinoco, Sonora and Calle
Ocho) to Chicago (Brio, Mas and Nacional) to the West Coast (Vinga
in San Francisco and Oba! in Portland).
 &HT;    ``It's a bonafide trend,'' says John F. Mariani, a noted
restaurant critic at Esquire magazine and author of ``The
Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink: More Than 2,000
Definitions and Descriptions of American Classics''
(Lebhar-Friedman Books, November 1999). ``Some of it has to do
solely with the fact that the Hispanic population of the United
States is increasing enormously. You've (also) got some real smart
Latinos who are doing it.''
 &HT;    Mariani says Nuevo Latino cuisine actually grew out of a
movement started in Miami in the late 1980s called New Caribbean,
or Floribbean, which featured meats and fish sunnied up with citrus
and exotic Caribbean fruits like mangoes, passion fruit and guava
and served with rice and beans. Its originators were mostly
non-Latinos, including Mark Militello at Mark's Place, Norman Van
Aken at Louis' Backyard and Robin Haas at The Colony.
 &HT;    But like many trendy food styles, its popularity started to
wane. So in the early 1990s, restaurateurs many of whom were Latin
American started reaching farther south for recipes and
ingredients.
 &HT;    One of them was Douglas Rodriguez. Part of the New Florida scene
at Yuca in Miami, the first-generation Cuban-American eventually
moved his show to New York City, opening the crowd-pleasing Patria
in 1994. Popular restaurant guide Zagat Survey currently includes
it as one of its top 50 restaurants in New York, calling it
``estupendo.'' ``Douglas Rodriguez whips up some of New York's most
exciting' food,'' its review says. ``Every bite is an explosion' of
flavors from dishes presented with flair.''' Rodriguez even went on
to write a cookbook called ``Nuevo Latino: Recipes that Celebrate
the New Latin American Cuisine'' (Ten Speed Press, 1995).
 &HT;    Esquire's Mariani says the most exciting chef on the scene right
now is Guillermo Pernot, who recently opened Pasion! in
Philadelphia. Pernot, who hails from Argentina, cut his teeth at
Gloria Estefan's Allioli on Miami Beach and Vega Grill in Manayunk,
Pennsylvania. His specialties include smoked chicken and corn
quesadillas with tomatillo pico de gallo, tamal cubano with a
watercress and scallion salad and barbecued pork with boniato
pancakes. It's not cheap, either: Dinner can set you back $80 per
person.
 &HT;    Despite many newcomers' entrance on the scene, many credit the
40-year-old Corda with ushering this Latin American cuisine to the
forefront, executing it flawlessly and with panache. Corda learned
to appreciate Latin American cooking from his mother, whose
specialties were simple dishes like `arroz con pollo' and `gallo
pinto,' a variation on the traditional Nicaraguan meal of rice and
beans. When he moved to College Station to attend Texas A&AMP;M
University in 1976, the closest thing he could find to Latin
American dining was Taco Bell. So he started cooking for his
roommates and friends. His first dish was a flop: He tried to fry
beans in oil to make refried beans. The only problem was that he
hadn't boiled the beans first.
 &HT;    His first restaurant also looked like it was going to be a
disaster. But after his encounter with First National Bank's Smith,
Corda invited him and his loan officer to the restaurant, where he
made a presentation and served them some of his best dishes. After
that, he snagged a $250,000 loan. Corda used that money to open a
second Churrascos closer to downtown. As with the first location,
it took a while to catch on. But once word got out, the restaurant
took off.
 &HT;    Then came his real taste of success. In July 1993, he opened
Americas, a souped-up version of Churrascos with Indian-inspired
decor on the inside (``looks like it was done by Picasso on
drugs,'' one reviewer said) and daring food on the plate, such as
taquitos filled with bacon-wrapped quail, mushrooms and chiles,
giant shrimp sauteed with cachaca-laced butter, and, to top it off,
dulce de arroz asturiano, a rice-pudding souffle in a carmelized
coconut basket. Mariani was so impressed, he included it as the top
new restaurant in the November issue of Esquire in 1993. After
that, foodies flooded in.
 &HT;    Despite the acclaim Corda has received, he's taken his lumps,
too. A Churrascos he opened in Chicago in 1997 to rave reviews
closed down after eight months when a local operating partner
backed out. He lost something in the six figures. And a line of
dips and plantains he developed for sale in supermarkets a few
years ago has never really taken off.
 &HT;    But Corda keeps creating new ideas and concepts. In November, he
plans to take Nuevo Latino cuisine downscale a bit with a new
Houston restaurant called the Amazon Grill. Diners will be able to
feast on some of the same food they enjoy at Churrascos and
Americas, but at more like $7 to $10 per entree. One of the
highlights: Instead of a salad bar, it will feature a sauce bar
with 18 different concoctions, from chimichurri, an olive
oil-and-cilantro pesto, to a coconut milk sauce. ``We want to bring
Latin cuisine to the masses,'' he says.
 &HT;    What advice would Corda give to other Latin Americans looking to
open shop in the U.S.? Do not renounce your roots, he says. ``We
can learn from the American experience,'' he says. ``But we have to
find the beauty of our culture and share it with Americans.'' Corda
certainly has.

<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Journeying to the heart of last spring's
Balkan nightmare, President Clinton goes Tuesday to Kosovo to
address its beleaguered citizens and buck up the spirits of
American troops struggling to enforce a fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be briefed on the deeply troubled allied mission to
knit the war-ravaged province back together and will host a
Thanksgiving week dinner for U.S. soldiers during his eight-hour
visit.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to appeal to majority ethnic Albanians to stop the
violent retribution against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks against Serbs have threatened NATO and United Nations
efforts in Kosovo, where Clinton led the West in spring air strikes
to counter a bloody campaign of Serb repression and terror
targeting Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make a very strong statement about the importance of
everybody getting over this ethnic hatred and going beyond it,''
Clinton told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all made a big commitment to Kosovo and its economic
and political reconstruction,'' Clinton said. ``But I think it's
very important that Kosovo, in effect, not become the mirror image
of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to seven years of attacks by Serbs against
non-Serbs in nearby Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, as well as
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of bolstering the political opponents of Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, Clinton held out
the promise Monday of large scale U.S. aid to Serbia _ but only if
Milosevic gives up power in Belgrade. Serbia is Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with war crimes by a U.N. tribunal, Milosevic has shown
no sign of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touted Bulgaria, a former Soviet satellite state, as a
model of the sort of democratic and ethnically tolerant nation that
is slowly changing the face of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your neighbor, Serbia, should be part of that bright and
different future,'' Clinton said in an address to more than 20,000
people jammed into Sofia's historic Nevski Square, an hour's drive
from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told that during the recent war you could actually hear
some of the bombs falling in Serbia from this square,'' Clinton
said, his breath showing misty in the chilled night air. ``Tonight,
I hope the people of Serbia can hear our voices when we say, if you
choose as Bulgaria has chosen, you will regain the rightful place
in Europe Mr. Milosevic has stolen from you, and America will help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit here amounted to a badly needed vote of
confidence for Bulgaria. Once one of the Soviet Union's most
reliable client states, Bulgaria is staggering through a bold if
uneven 10-year march from communist totalitarianism to free-market
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that journey has left Bulgaria stranded at the eastern
edge of the Balkans. Already one of the poorest nations in Europe _
with per capita income barely reaching $1,500 per year _ Bulgaria
has been further strangled by the war in Yugoslavia, through which
most of Bulgaria's international trade must flow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's National Security Advisor, Samuel Berger, said
Milosevic is preventing the United States from helping to clear the
Danube River of a half-dozen bridges dropped by NATO warplanes
during 78 days of air strikes last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The bridges have left the Danube _ the main trade artery linking
the Balkans to Central Europe _ impassable through Serbia. The
condition is wreaking economic havoc on countries like Bulgaria,
Romania and Macedonia. All depend heavily upon Danube connections
for imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to clear the Danube,'' Berger said. Milosevic,
though, has said NATO countries may only help clear the bridges if
they also rebuild them, Berger said, adding ``That's not something
we're prepared to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Clinton's agenda Tuesday will be meetings with the
allied civilian and military leaders that are administering Kosovo
_ Bernard Kouchner, the special U.N. representative for civilian
operations and German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, commander of the 41,000
troops, 6,300 of them Americans, making up the U.N. peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to meet with Albanian leaders Ibrahim
Rugova and Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, as well as Kosovo's highest Serb religious authority, Serb
Orthodox Bishop Artimije.
</P>
<P>
   The troops and humanitarian aid  moved in last June,
following NATO air strikes. The campaign was waged to halt the
abuse of ethnic Albanians by Serbs, who are estimated to have
killed up to 10,000 Albanians while forcing more than 1.2 million
others to flee their homes and take refuge in the mountains of
Kosovo or beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after the NATO victory, though, the allied operation
there is listing badly:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Albanians seeking revenge have killed scores of ethnic Serbs
and intimidated and terrorized thousands more. Berger estimated
that as many as three in four of the 200,000 Serbs that call Kosovo
home have fled the province.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While nearly 900,000 Albanian refugees have returned home,
hundreds of thousands lack basic housing. Aid workers are rushing
in plastic sheeting and plywood, in hopes of providing every family
at least one weather-proofed room before the harsh Balkan winter
sets in over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Money promised by the West for peacekeeping and reconstruction
in Kosovo has fallen far short of pledges. As a result, a broad
array of programs, from training local police to restoring water
and electricity, has been slowed. U.S. and European donors pledged
more than $1 billion for Kosovo reconstruction last week. The
money, $158 million of which was promised by the United States, is
supposed to be made available between now and the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The problems were largely anticipated, U.S. officials said
Monday, but they are problems just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who saw the way the refugees, some 800,000, were
unceremoniously dumped out of railroad cars into the mud on the
borders of neighboring Macedonia and Albania understood there was
going to be a real problem trying to reconcile Serbs and Albanians
after that,'' said special White House envoy Christopher Hill, who
oversees Balkan matters for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we've got a lot further to go with Kosovo,'' said
Hill, who has spent most of the past decade working on U.S. policy
in Kosovo, Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with these problems in the Balkans, I mean, it's
like you're pounding some warped floorboards,'' Hill said. ``You
get one down and another one pops up somewhere, so you've got to
work with that one.''

PRINT ARTIST SUITE PACKS NEW FEATURES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After writing for so many years about computer programs, I've
almost ceased to be amazed about software.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's surprising how much software publishers can cram
into a box when it comes to desktop publishing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Print Artist Grande Suite 8.0 is an example (Windows; about $60
to $70). The previous version from SierraHome was the top-selling
home-publishing program in 1998 according to PC Data. The new
version has a sophisticated Web-page design program, more than
200,000 graphics and images, and photo shop for manipulating
pictures, a wide selection of animated electronic cards for
e-mailing and an overhauled user interface.
</P>
<P>
   The program can turn out Web pages, cards, crafts, posters,
newsletters, stickers, labels, stationery, business cards,
letterhead, digital albums and Web slide shows.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 10,000 layouts designed by professionals for
the aforementioned projects. Moreover, new users get more help from
a guide that walks them through the process of using the program.
</P>
<P>
   An unlimited number of documents can be opened at one time. It's
a nice feature, but beyond having two or three documents open at
once, one that most users will never need to experience. But it's
easy to drag and drop objects between open documents _ a feature
that makes the program easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right picture to use from the program's 200,000 is
easy enough using a graphics grabber that searches for keywords.
Thumbnail pictures are also available.
</P>
<P>
   SnapShot Express is a sophisticated tool for working with
graphics and has the ability to clean up pictures (cropping,
removing red eyes and other features) and manipulate them.
</P>
<P>
   A step-by-step tutorial gives an overview of the program's ``Web
Studio Express'' for designing Web pages. It, too, contains
professionally designed templates, animations, backgrounds and
other useful tools. One of those tools is ``iCollect,'' which can
pull graphics or entire Web pages off the Internet for use later.
</P>
<P>
   If you need less power at a lower price, Print Artist Gold 8.0
and Print Artist Platinum 8.0 are also available.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call toll free (800-757-7707) or visit the
company's Web site (www.siearrahome.com).
</P>
<P>
   SUPER DUPER ARCADE
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish, SPY Fox and Putt-Putt are comic
characters from Humongous Entertainment computer games. They're all
on one CD with the collection of Humongous' Super Duper Arcade I
and II.
</P>
<P>
   Each CD has four arcade games and will run on either Windows or
Macintosh computers. Each game has hundreds of levels. Each CD
should be available for about $15 to $19.
</P>
<P>
   Super Duper Arcade I contains Putt-Putt and Pep's
Balloon-O-Rama, Pajama Sam's Sock Works, Freddi Fish and Luther's
Water Worries, and SPY Fox in Cheese Chase. Super Duper Arcade II
has Putt-Putt and Pep's Dog on a Stick, Pajama Sam's Lost and
Found, Freddi Fish and Luther's Maze Madness. All seven of those
titles are previously released. The fourth game on Arcade II is SPY
Fox in ``Hold the Mustard,'' a new release in which SPY Fox hurries
to save the world's supply of ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the games have game editors so kids can create and swap
new levels. For younger children, the ``Junior Helper'' feature
found in some of the games slows down the action to give younger
players a better chance.

 Por CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ A mediados de los anos 80, Michael Cordua, un
nicaraguense de 26 anos, trabajaba para una compania naviera en
Houston cuando la industria petrolera entro en crisis. A Cordua
siempre le habia gustado cocinar, de modo que con lo que le pagaron
como indemnizacion por despido abrio en 1988 un restaurante llamado
Churrascos en un barrio pobre de Houston. Como indica su nombre,
era un restaurante especializado en carnes estilo argentino pero
con un sabor contemporaneo.
 &HT;    A pesar de las buenas resenas, entre ellas una de Texas Monthly
que le aumento la clientela, el establecimiento daba perdida, y al
cabo de cuatro meses Cordua estaba dispuesto a quitarse el
delantal. Pero lo ayudo la suerte. La esposa de un banquero de
Houston, Fred Smith, del First National Bank, comio en el
restaurante y se lo recomendo a su esposo. Smith quedo tan a gusto
que despues de comer le dio su tarjeta a Cordua. ``Si piensa
expandir el negocio, llameme,'' le dijo. Cordua, que estaba al
borde de la ruina, lo llamo. Ahora tiene dos Churrascos en Houston
y un restaurante mas fino cerca de la elegante Galleria, llamado
Americas. Planea abrir otro Churrascos en San Antonio este otono y
tal vez despues uno en Phoenix. Su proposito es extender el
concepto a toda la nacion.
 &HT;    Cordua fue uno de los pioneros del arrollador movimiento
gastronomico conocido en Estados Unidos como Nuevo Latino. En todo
el pais surgen restaurantes que sirven estos platos
latinoamericanos con un giro moderno, desde Nueva York (Orinoco,
Sonora y Calle Ocho), pasando por Chicago (Brio, Mas y Nacional)
hasta la costa oeste (Vinga en San Francisco y Oba! en Portland).
 &HT;    ``Es una autentica moda,'' dice John F. Mariani, destacado

latinos.''
 &HT;    Mariani dice que el sabor Nuevo Latino surgio de un movimiento
iniciado en Miami a fines de los anos 80 con el nombre de New
Caribbean o Floribbean: carnes y pescados sazonados con citricos y
acompanados con frutas caribenas, como mango, parchita y guayaba,
con arroz y frijoles. Sus creadores, en su mayoria, no eran
hispanos: Mark Militello, de Mark's Place; Norman Van Aken, de
Louie's Backyard, y Robin Haas, de The Colony.
 &HT;    Pero como muchos estilos gastronomicos de moda, su popularidad
comenzo a decaer. De modo que a principios de los anos 90, los
duenos de restaurantes (muchos de ellos latinoamericanos) miraron
mas al sur en busca de recetas e ingredientes.
 &HT;    Uno de ellos fue Douglas Rodriguez. Este cubanoamericano de
primera generacion, dueno del Yuca en Miami, se traslado a Nueva
York, donde abrio el popular Patria en 1994. La guia culinaria

Manzana y lo califica de ``estupendo.''
 &HT;    ``Los platos de Douglas Rodriguez estan entre `los mas
emocionantes' de Nueva York,'' dice la resena. ``Cada bocado es una
explosion de sabores de platos presentados con estilo.'' Rodriguez
escribio un libro de recetas de cocina llamado ``Nuevo Latino:
Recipes that Celebrate the New Latin American Cuisine,'' publicado
por Ten Speed Press en 1995.
 &HT;    Mariani, de Esquire, dice que el chef mas popular en estos
momentos es Guillermo Pernot, que recientemente abrio Pasion! en
Philadelphia. Pernot, que procede de Argentina, se perfecciono en
el Allioli de Gloria Estefan, en Miami Beach, y en Vega Grill, en
Manayunk, Pennsylvania. Entre sus especialidades estan el pollo
ahumado y las quesadillas de maiz con tomatillo pico de gallo, el
tamal cubano con ensalada de berro y escalonia, y cerdo a la
parrilla con boniato. No es barato: la cena puede costar US$80 por
persona.
 &HT;    A pesar de la gran cantidad de recien llegados, muchos atribuyen
a Cordua el auge de los platos latinoamericanos. Cordua se aficiono
a la cocina gracias a su madre, que preparaba recetas simples como
arroz con pollo y gallo pinto, un plato nicaraguense de arroz con
frijoles rojos. Cuando se traslado a College Station para asistir a
la Universidad de Texas A&AMP;M en 1976, lo mas parecido a la comida
latinoamericana que pudo encontrar fue Taco Bell. De modo que
empezo a cocinar para sus amigos y companeros de estudios. Su
primer intento termino en el fracaso: trato de freir frijoles en
aceite para hacer frijoles refritos. El unico problema fue que se
le olvido ablandar los frijoles primero.
 &HT;    Su primer restaurante tambien dio la impresion de que iba a ser
un desastre. Pero al conocer a Smith, de First National Bank,
Cordua lo invito a el y a su agente de prestamos al restaurante,
donde hizo una presentacion y sirvio sus mejores platos. Despues
consiguio un prestamo de US$250.000, que uso para abrir otro
Churrascos cerca de la zona centrica. Al igual que le sucedio con
el primer establecimiento, no tuvo un exito inmediato. Pero cuando
se corrio la voz, el restaurante triunfo.
 &HT;    Luego llego el verdadero exito. En julio de 1993, abrio
Americas, una version mas refinada de Churrascos, con una
decoracion interior de motivos indios (``da la impresion de que la
hizo Picasso endrogado,'' dijo un cronista) y platos audaces, como
taquitos rellenos de codorniz y tocino, hongos y chiles, camarones
salteados con mantequilla sazonada con cachaca, y de postres, dulce
de arroz asturiano, un pudin de arroz en una cesta de coco con
caramelo. Mariani quedo tan impresionado, que l califico como el
mejor restaurante nuevo en la edicion de Esquire de noviembre de
1993. Despues de eso, el publico invadio el lugar.
 &HT;    A pesar de los elogios que ha recibido Cordua, ha tenido sus
reveses. Un Churrascos que abrio en Chicago en 1997 y que recibio
criticas entusiastas cerro al cabo de ocho meses, cuando un socio
local se retiro del negocio. Perdio una suma de seis digitos. Y una
linea de salsas y platanos que creo para vender en supermercados,
hace unos anos, nunca ha tenido gran exito.
 &HT;    Pero Cordua sigue inventando conceptos. En noviembre, planea
lanzar una variante economica de la cocina estilo Nuevo Latino con
la inauguracion de un restaurante en Houston llamado Amazon Grill.
El establecimiento servira la misma comida que en Churrascos y en
Americas, pero con un precio entre US$7 y US$10 el plato fuerte.
Una de las curiosidades del local es que en vez de salad bar,
tendra un sauce bar con 18 salsas, entre ellas chimichurri, que se
hace con aceite de oliva y cilantro, y una salsa de leche de coco.
``Queremos llevar este tipo de cocina a las masas,'' dice.
 &HT;    Cual es el consejo que da Cordua a los latinoamericanos que
quieren poner tienda en Estados Unidos? No renuncien a sus raices,
recomienda. ``Podemos aprender de la experiencia norteamericana.
Pero tenemos que encontrar la belleza de nuestra cultura y
compartirla con los americanos.'' Es exactamente lo que ha hecho
Cordua.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ A mediados de los anos 80, Michael Cordua, un
nicaraguense de 26 anos, trabajaba para una compania naviera en
Houston cuando la industria petrolera entro en crisis. A Cordua
siempre le habia gustado cocinar, de modo que con lo que le pagaron
como indemnizacion por despido abrio en 1988 un restaurante llamado
Churrascos en un barrio pobre de Houston. Como indica su nombre,
era un restaurante especializado en carnes estilo argentino pero
con un sabor contemporaneo.
 &HT;    A pesar de las buenas resenas, entre ellas una de Texas Monthly
que le aumento la clientela, el establecimiento daba perdida, y al
cabo de cuatro meses Cordua estaba dispuesto a quitarse el
delantal. Pero lo ayudo la suerte. La esposa de un banquero de
Houston, Fred Smith, del First National Bank, comio en el
restaurante y se lo recomendo a su esposo. Smith quedo tan a gusto
que despues de comer le dio su tarjeta a Cordua. ``Si piensa
expandir el negocio, llameme,'' le dijo. Cordua, que estaba al
borde de la ruina, lo llamo. Ahora tiene dos Churrascos en Houston
y un restaurante mas fino cerca de la elegante Galleria, llamado
Americas. Planea abrir otro Churrascos en San Antonio este otono y
tal vez despues uno en Phoenix. Su proposito es extender el
concepto a toda la nacion.
 &HT;    Cordua fue uno de los pioneros del arrollador movimiento
gastronomico conocido en Estados Unidos como Nuevo Latino. En todo
el pais surgen restaurantes que sirven estos platos
latinoamericanos con un giro moderno, desde Nueva York (Orinoco,
Sonora y Calle Ocho), pasando por Chicago (Brio, Mas y Nacional)
hasta la costa oeste (Vinga en San Francisco y Oba! en Portland).
 &HT;    ``Es una autentica moda,'' dice John F. Mariani, destacado
critico de restaurantes de la revista Esquire. ``Tiene que ver en
gran medida con el enorme crecimiento de la poblacion hispana en
Estados Unidos. Y tambien con la inteligencia de varios empresarios
latinos.''

GORE REVAMPS HIS STYLE, NOT HIS SUBSTANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bill Clinton picked Al Gore as his running
mate seven years ago, the future vice president's father found it
the most natural thing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was raised for it,'' proclaimed Albert A. Gore Sr., a wily
Tennessee populist who had preceded his son in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the comment's whiff of noblesse oblige grated against
the down-home, ``feel your pain'' earnestness of Clinton's New
Democrats, it seemed a fair assessment of a young man who grew up
in the shadow of Washington power, was educated at the best schools
and had launched a solid political career of his own that already
included an unsuccessful but not embarrassing presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the vice presidency of Al Gore has been marked by
a long, substantive agenda _ with a foreign portfolio that includes
a major piece of the U.S.-Russia account and a domestic
things-to-do list so extensive that one project was grandiosely
labeled ``reinventing government.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has repaid Clinton with unfailing loyalty, with the
exception of a few public chastisements about the president's
offstage sexual antics. On the day of the House impeachment vote
last December, Gore stood at Clinton's side and hailed him as ``a
man who I believe will be regarded in the history books as one of
our greatest presidents.'' He repeated the assessment earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as Gore seeks the White House himself, he seems weighed
down by his Washington upbringing, his mannered style, his
allegiance to the morally challenged Clinton and even by his
current job as vice president _ historically one of the surest ways
in U.S. history not to get directly to the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem was bad enough when national polls consistently
showed him lagging behind the front-runner for the Republican
nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Gore's plight has been
exacerbated by the increasing draw of his only challenger for the
Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore has fought to reinvigorate his campaign, it has become a
jerry-built attempt to escape his background of political
privilege, his reputation as an uptight maven of policy esoterica
and his recent past as a Clinton subordinate. It is even an attempt
to overcome what one campaign adviser, feminist author Naomi Wolf,
sees as Gore's subservient ``beta male'' personality.
</P>
<P>
   Substantively, this alteration-in-progress is a tall, tricky
order for a serious aficionado of the intricacies of nuclear
philosophy and the author of a controversial environmental tome
ominously titled ``Earth in the Balance.'' Stylistically, it is
also far from a sure thing for a politician so formal in mien that
this joke arose in his 1988 presidential campaign: Question: How do
you tell Al Gore from his Secret Service agents? Answer: He's the
stiff one.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few months, even as Gore has remained true to
his market-tested, top-drawer electoral issues of education, health
care and gun control, he has undertaken an almost frenzied
makeover, changing his stump speech, his approach to voters and
even his wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by turns, can now be aggressive or warm and empathetic. He
bounded in to the macho environs of an AFL-CIO convention with
high-fives for delegates. He took charge of the pregame show for
his first major joint appearance with Bradley, signaling that he
was ready for the questions whether his opponent was or not. Gore
solicitously asks audience members their first names and about
their lives, then tosses the personal tidbits smoothly into his
answers.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken occasionally to three-button suits in earth tones
and French-blue shirts. An intense exercise program has accentuated
his angular, 51-year-old good looks.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a bit of a bodybuilder swagger, perhaps a twin
product of Wolf's admonitions to be more assertive and his daily
encounters with an ab cruncher. On a recent transcontinental
flight, Gore conducted a string of interviews in his workout get-up
of purple T-shirt, greenish shorts and flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   The differences, however, are not all physical or superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Often in campaign appearances, before addressing his core issues
or the audience's questions, Gore has begun to talk about his
mother's childhood of poverty in western Tennessee and her struggle
to obtain a law degree. He relates his father's ``great courage''
in early opposition to the poll tax, segregation and the Vietnam
War _ which figured in Gore Sr.'s defeat in 1970. The vice
president talks of the deep disillusionment he felt on returning 30
years ago, even as a noncombat veteran, from ``the dark tunnel'' of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I connecting?'' Gore seems to implore as he walks audiences
through the emotional perils of growing to manhood in the 1960s and
1970s. To illustrate his heightened sense of disgust three decades
ago, he can even work in the easily demonized Richard Nixon and
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that made me feel like I didn't want to have anything to
do with politics,'' Gore says in one well-rehearsed segment of his
revamped stump speech. ``I thought it would be the absolutely last
thing I ever did in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A few segues later, though, he is hitting on voters to elect him
to the highest office in the land and at least by implication
citing his 12 years in the House, seven years in the Senate and
seven years at Clinton's side as his best qualification.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has convinced himself that he feels good _ and genuine _
about his new style and approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about tactics,'' Gore insisted in his office aboard
the Boeing 757 that currently functions as Air Force Two. ``I am
who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore may have shed his conservative suit, but he is still clad
in the caution that seems to mark almost his every utterance, even
the attempts at self-deprecatory humor. Someone has called it the
``vice presidential pause,'' the split second in which throughout
his years as the nation's second banana Gore has forced himself to
consider how each word will reflect on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's considering how it reflects on him personally and
on his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for president of this country is far more important
than being the best vice president I can possibly be,'' Gore told
reporters on a recent swing through early-voting Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a full-time candidate, still making a few ``official''
appearances, although almost all of them have the campaign squarely
in mind. He has trimmed back contacts with Clinton and his White
House; regular weekly luncheons with the president are a thing of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am communicating with people about what motivates me at the
same time that I communicate with them about my agenda for the
future,'' Gore contends. ``And it's not a question of what works
(politically), it's a question of what's real.''
</P>
<P>
   But just months ago _ before the rise of Bradley _ Gore was
working with what he saw as a different reality. He had ensured
there would be no challenge for the Democratic nomination from the
usual suspects _ especially House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., a feared rival from the 1988 presidential race _ and focused
on what he thought would be a months-long campaign against
Republican Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Until late summer, Gore refused to mention Bradley by name.
Suddenly, he wanted to debate the guy every week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has convinced himself _ at least in comments for public
consumption _ that a standoff for the Democratic nomination is
laudable and was foreordained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome a close, hard-fought race,'' Gore said. ``I think
it's good for the party, good for the country. I think in some ways
it was inevitable that if the race became a two-person race and if
Senator Bradley crossed the threshold of credibility then it would
inevitably tighten. I welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is no slouch at making a virtue of a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   He will not even concede that he feels put upon to do the
inner-feelings shtick that has become such a significant part of
his basic campaign appeal _ an example of the exploration of a
candidate's psyche that columnist Charles Krauthammer calls ``part
of the trivialization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to know what you're made of and where
you're coming from,'' Gore said. ``What's in your heart, not only
what's in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a bad thing,'' he adds, without remarking
on why only recently has he made the personal exploration a key
part of his campaign kit. ``I think those questions are in many
ways more relevant than some of the more cerebral questions that
supposedly were focused on in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Gore is a traditional center-left Democrat who one day
last month claimed the endorsement of the AFL-CIO, the party's
strongest link to its working-class foundations, and appeared the
next day before the Democratic Leadership Council, a
business-backed amalgam of party leaders who got tired of losing
the White House with such unabashedly liberal candidates as former
Vice President Walter Mondale and former Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney hailed Gore for standing
``shoulder to shoulder with working men and women and our union in
fighting off the attacks of a radical Congress.'' Gore responded
with a pledge to veto anti-union legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, could be
equally lavish in his praise for the vice president, asserting:
``Al Gore is ready to keep America changing in the right
direction.'' Gore responded with a political play on words, noting
that the Democratic Party, like the championship University of
Connecticut basketball team, ``should always have a strong
center.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats can also express their concern about Gore as a
national standard-bearer, even as they tout his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's not flashy enough,'' said Rep. Ed Pastor,
D-Ariz., as he introduced Gore at a fund-raising event in Phoenix.
``But I'll tell you this, he's good.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also tireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to shake every single hand here,'' Gore told about
200 folks at Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua, N.H., one
night last month. And he almost did, at the end of a two-hour
session in which the vice president answered dozens of question
from an audience of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke to their personal problems and worries _ the need for
election materials in Braille, Social Security reform, prescription
drug costs, even the isolated foreign policy inquiry _ as well as
addressing local tragedies such as the murder of a young woman by
an Internet stalker. Gore had already talked by telephone to the
dead woman's father.
</P>
<P>
   Whether asked or not, Gore slipped in his position favoring
nuclear weapons control, his opposition to much of offshore
drilling, his proposals for additional gun control, use of light
rail to curb urban sprawl, campaign finance limits, reform but not
elimination of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was a tour de force for a politician whose manner
supposedly gives trees a bad name. After a subsequent Gore ``town
hall'' session in New Hampshire, a local reporter wrote that the
vice president was ``as warm and fuzzy as the sweaters he now
wears'' to meet voters. Earlier in the year, she wrote, Gore in a
similar setting was ``as wooden as the stool he sat on.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters claim the candidate's most recent
incarnation _ caring and communicative _ is the genuine article,
and that the earlier formality had been dictated by his No. 2 role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to tell all our neighbors, friends and family about
the real Al Gore,'' Washington Gov. Gary Locke exhorted a Seattle
fund-raising dinner last month. One touching testimonial came from
Jim Frush, a lawyer-mountaineer who led Gore and son Albert Gore
III up Mount Rainier last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is not a quitter,'' Frush said of Gore's climb.
``This man was our sparkplug. ... This is a man of fortitude,
courage and physical endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Gore's campaign is to mass-market the sense of
security, ease and respect that people like Frush _ as well as many
voters _ feel after spending time with the vice president in small
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed with his ability to think,'' said Dana
Rogers after Gore addressed parents, teachers and students at an
overcrowded elementary school in Las Vegas. ``I'm a registered
Republican,'' said Rogers, Miss Texas 1984 and now star of
``Jubilee'' at Bally's Hotel and Casino, ``but some of the things
he said today struck a chord with me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of Gore's evening with voters in Nashua, N.H.,
Jay Hether, who works for a military supplier, was aghast at the
difference between the Gore he expected and the Gore he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more passionate than I thought he'd be,'' Hether said.
</P>
<P>
   And more importantly for the campaign ahead, Hether could begin
to see Gore as a politician distinct from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the shadows,'' Hether said, ``but he stepped out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about time.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Harris poll found that by a 2-1 margin (60 percent to
29 percent), voters nationally believe Gore has been hurt by his
association with the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's clearly a major political issue and enormous personal
quandary for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Several longtime Gore associates said they worry about the vice
president's seeming inability to admit that he has ever been wrong
or changed his mind _ on issues big and small. This could be an
important flaw, especially in a candidate who plans to point out
what he believes are flip-flops in Bradley's record.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most startling swings for Gore has come in his stance
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood by the swimming pool of a Brentwood mansion in Los
Angeles recently, accepting an award from a group of abortion
rights activists, it was amazing to consider that only 12 years
ago, Gore wrote to a Tennessee constituent: ``During my 11 years in
Congress, I have consistently opposed federal funding of abortions.
... In my opinion, it is wrong to spend federal funds for what is
arguably the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore contends he has never changed his position on the
issue, even though he is now a full-throated advocate of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore fights tobacco interests, and continues to tell the
story of his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984, he is
sometimes reminded of his hard pitch to North Carolinians in his
1988 presidential campaign, when he said: ``Throughout most of my
life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands,
all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've
hoed it. I've chopped it. I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in
the barn and stripped it and sold it.''
</P>
<P>
   This ease with the about-face is striking to people who have
examined Gore's life and work, including Bob Zelnick, the former
ABC News correspondent who has written a biography of Gore that his
campaign sees as critical and negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem with Gore is ... I believe, a tendency in
him not to acknowledge the possibility of error on an issue he
feels strongly about,'' Zelnick said. Gore views someone who
disagrees with him as not someone to be debated, convinced or even
defeated, ''but as someone who must be discredited, someone who
must be excommunicated, must be driven out from the society of
reasonable people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not yet taken that harsh a tack with Bradley. But for
partisan crowds, Gore argues that he was exemplary _ and Bradley,
by inference, found wanting _ when faced with the ``two most
important defining moments'' for Democrats in the last 20 years _
votes on President Reagan's economic program and the reaction to
the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted against. I fought against it,'' Gore says of Reagan's
1991 budget cuts, which Bradley supported. ``Some felt that in
order to survive politically they should vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley served a year or so after Republicans took over, then
announced he would not seek re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us was called upon to ... fight against it with
everything we had or not,'' Gore says. ``I didn't walk away from
the fight when Newt Gingrich took over the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   This has inspired a battle cry to which Gore turns now and
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud that even in the hardest hour I never gave up,
never turned back and never walked away,'' Gore declared at an Iowa
Democratic dinner last month, rousing the crowd with an impassioned
plea to ``stay and fight!''
</P>
<P>
   The heated rhetoric, whether the vice president has thought
about it, is not only part of the new, aggressive Gore but also an
echo of his populist roots from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore sorts through his old and new styles he faces another
question: What will he _ or can he _ try next if his latest
political incarnation does not move enough voters to stabilize his
campaign?

 &HT;    Settlement of Gingrich divorce may hinge on lover's deposition
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's estranged wife hopes today will
resolve a months-long quest for answers from her husband's lover.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge is set to
hear arguments this morning about what gifts, records and other
documents Gingrich's girlfriend, Callista Bisek, must turn over in
his Cobb County, Ga., divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the records requested by Gingrich's wife, Marianne, date
back to January 1995, when Gingrich was sworn in a speaker of the
U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge also must decide how soon Bisek, a Virginia resident and
scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, will have to sit for
questioning by Marianne Gingrich's attorney. They have asked that a
deposition be held within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich says she'll attend the hearing. Efforts to
contact Bisek and her attorney have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing is significant because Marianne Gingrich, 48,
and her attorney appear intent on taking Bisek's deposition before
they will talk settlement. The Bisek deposition is among several
disputes that have marked the contentious case since the
twice-married Newt Gingrich filed for divorce in July. Gingrich and
Marianne have been married 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek, a scheduler for the Agriculture Committee, has already
testified under oath for Gingrich's attorneys that her affair with
the former Georgia congressman began six years ago. Attorneys for
Gingrich, 56, also have admitted that he had an ``intimate
relationship'' with Bisek, 33.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bisek still refuses to answer Marianne Gingrich's
questions under oath or respond to certain document requests. Both
areas could contain evidence that might be used during a divorce
trial or to leverage a more favorable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has argued that many of Marianne Gingrich's questions are
either too broad or vague. Bisek has also expressed concerns that
some of the questions infringe upon her constitutional right not to
incriminate herself. Adultery is a crime in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hedge ordered lawyers for the Gingriches to try to
reach a compromise on the subpoena. While they agreed on certain
items, they reached an impasse on others.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has agreed to reveal several gifts Gingrich gave her,
including a pearl ring and a set of Callaway Golf clubs. Bisek also
is prepared to reveal money Gingrich has spent on her, or trips
she's taken at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   There's much more Bisek still refuses to turn over, including
phone records for the past five years, correspondence between her
and Gingrich, as well as photos, videotapes or audiotapes of them
together.

COLLEGE PRESIDENTS' SALARIES HIGHEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich are getting richer, and that includes college
presidents, according to an annual national survey.
</P>
<P>
   The number of college presidents earning more than $500,000 in
salary and benefits grew to eight in 1997-98 from three the
previous year, according to the survey of private college
presidents by the Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one made more than $300,000, up from 50 the year before,
and 25 four years ago _ making this what the weekly trade newspaper
called the most lucrative year to be a college president.
</P>
<P>
   Howard J. Burnett, the outgoing president of Washington and
Jefferson College, near Pittsburgh, left office as the highest-paid
president in the land that year, earning $1,082,624 in salary and
benefits. That was largely because of a generous retirement package
in recognition of years of good service, the Chronicle said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the second-highest-paid president, Orley Herron of
National-Louis University in Evanston, Ill., counted a severance
package, given as inducement to quit, in his overall compensation
of $639,694. For packages that didn't include retirement or
severance, Torsten Wiesel, president of New York's Rockefeller
University, earned the most of any president, at $555,864.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University Chancellor John R. Silber, long among the
nation's highest-paid college executives, earned a total of
$564,690 in salary and benefits, according to the Chronicle, about
$186,000 more than his successor, as BU president, Jon Westling.
But Silber's salary has remained almost the same since 1993-94,
while about 20 presidents on the list reported raises of 25 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Simmons, president of Smith College in Northampton, Mass.,
ranks among the top-paid presidents at colleges that focus on
primarily undergraduate education, earning $320,478.
</P>
<P>
   The publication surveys the tax forms of 475 private colleges
and universities every year, leaving out the presidents of public
institutions, who tend to earn relatively less than their private
school counterparts.

BUSINESS GROUPS VOW TO FIGHT NEW ANTI-INJURY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With billions of dollars at stake, business groups
vowed Monday to battle proposed federal regulations that would
force many employers to correct injury-causing workplace conditions
that require repetitive motion, overexertion or awkward posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community is going to oppose the standards both
on Capitol Hill and in the courts,'' said Randel Johnson, vice
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents more
than 3 million businesses and organizations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the Labor Department formally announced the
proposed rules _ which would affect about one of every three, or
1.9 million, work sites _ saying the regulations are needed to
protect more than 27 million workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are getting hurt; workers are being sent home;
people are suffering,'' said Charles N. Jeffress, assistant labor
secretary for occupational safety and health.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders applauded the government action. ``It confirms
what workers have known for years _ that these injuries are caused
by workplace hazards and can be prevented,'' AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, 1.8 million workers have injuries related to
so-called ergonomic factors, and 600,000 people miss some work
because of them, according to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), the Labor Department's agency in charge of
developing and enforcing the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomics is a recent science that involves fitting a job to
the physical limitations of the worker. This is an issue in jobs
where workers might be exposed to too many repetitive motions,
loads that are too heavy, or awkward postures that result in
overexertion of certain muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The musculoskeletal injuries _ those that damage muscles,
nerves, ligaments, tendons and bones _ include such problems as
carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, tendinitis, rotator cuff
syndrome (in the shoulder) and herniated spinal disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that work-related musculoskeletal disorders ...
are the most prevalent, most expensive and most preventable
workplace injuries in the country, and it is time we do something
about it,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a senior Democrat on a House
labor-health panel, called the new rules ``a pro-worker proposal
that builds on existing worker compensation protections and will be
particularly welcomed bu women.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said women are disproportionately affected by ergonomic
injuries, suffering 63 percent of repetitive-motion injuries and
making up 69 percent of lost-work cases from carpal tunnel syndrome
although they are 46 percent of the workforce and 33 percent of
injured workers generally.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would cover a broad range of workers including
nurses' aides who must lift heavy patients, baggage handlers at
airports and people who work at computers or on assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, a worker who has an ergonomic injury diagnosed
by a doctor would be entitled to have the work environment fixed to
relieve the cause of the problem _ by changing the height of an
assembly line or computer keyboard, for example.
</P>
<P>
   A worker who must be assigned to lighter duty during recovery
from an ergonomic injury would be guaranteed normal pay and
benefits. A worker who must leave the job altogether would be
guaranteed 90 percent pay and full benefits during recovery.
</P>
<P>
   At workplaces with numerous ergonomic injuries, employers would
have to provide medical help and retraining for workers in addition
to treating their physical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would also require all manufacturers and companies
with workers who do manual heavy lifting to provide training to
prevent injury.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules, scheduled to be published in Tuesday's
Federal Register, cannot become final until next November at the
earliest, after a comment period that will include public hearings
in Washington and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA estimated that employers who need to correct problems will
spend an average of $150 a year per work station fixed. The agency
forecast the total cost to be $4.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson argued that the proposed rules would cost employers
more than $100 billion the first year and tens of billions of
dollars every year afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members will literally have to retool practically every
warehouse, factory and office in America,'' he said. ``That will be
tremendously expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also criticized OSHA for proposing the rules before the
release, expected next summer, of a National Academy of Sciences
study on whether ergonomic problems at work cause injuries. Earlier
this year, the House passed legislation blocking any OSHA action
until the NAS study is completed, but the Senate adjourned before
passing similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there simply isn't enough scientific evidence
proving that ergonomic problems at work cause injury,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, businesses are not opposed to protecting
their workers from such injuries. ``We just feel that before we
spend billions of dollars on a problem that we know what causes the
problem and what solutions work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department estimates the new rules could prevent
injury to about 300,000 workers annually and save employers $9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomic injuries currently cost $15 billion to $20 billion a
year for workers' compensation and $30 billion to $40 billion in
other expenses such as medical care, the agency said.

   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ Iraq on Monday halted exports of
crude oil through the Turkish port of Ceyhan, effectively rejecting
a two-week extension of its oil-for-food program, the United
Nations announced. The move followed a decision by the Security
Council on Friday to extend the oil-for-food program by two weeks
instead of the customary 180 days. Some diplomats interpreted the
extension as putting pressure on the five permanent members of the
council to wrap up negotiations on a new comprehensive resolution
on Iraqi sanctions. (Summary from wires.) By Barbara Crossette.

   NY-REMEDIAL-EDUC (New York) _ The New York state Board of
Regents on Monday cleared the way for the City University of New
York to begin to exclude students who cannot demonstrate that they
are ready to begin ``college level work'' in both mathematics and
English. In making the most fundamental change in standards since
open admissions was instituted nearly three decades ago, the
Regents expressed their wariness by setting certain conditions on
CUNY's policy. One compromise called for a 12 month delay until
September 2001 for the starting date at City College and Lehman
College, the colleges whose overwhelmingly minority populations
would be most affected by the new policy. CUNY will be allowed to
begin to enforce the policy at four of its senior college campuses
in January. By Karen Arenson.

to receive free bags of rice, millet and sorghum. The practice is
regarded here as a crude attempt to burnish the image of the
Abachas, who have become the poster-family of an unexpected and
ambitious drive by the county's new president, Olusegun Obasanjo,
to root out corruption. By Norimitsu Onishi.

   Ensor, Once Unloved, Gets a Retrospective
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian painter James Ensor (1860-1949) may have been the
ultimate misunderstood artist. Disliked by the critics and rebuffed
by his peers early in his career, Ensor attempted to sell the
entire contents of his art studio in 1893 for a mere 8,500 Belgian
francs, then the equivalent of around $300 _ and failed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Ensor is now considered to be a precursor of German
Expressionism, among other movements, public recognition _ and a
Belgian barony _ came late in his life. Through Feb. 13, the Royal
Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels is presenting its first
retrospective of Ensor's career to mark the 50th anniversary of his
death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a three-year student sojourn at the Academy of Fine
Arts in Brussels, Ensor lived and worked exclusively in the coastal
town of Ostende. Much of his macabre and hallucinogenic
iconography, featuring bloated tourists and masked carnival
figures, is derived from childhood images of his parents' seaside
souvenir stand.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition groups 370 paintings, etchings and drawings with
a special emphasis placed on works created before 1900, when Ensor
was struggling to establish his singular vision. Although one of
Ensor's most monumental masterworks, titled ``Christ's Entry Into
Brussels in 1889,'' is not on loan from the Getty Museum, the
comprehensive Brussels show includes a rare 1898 print of the
painting, six drawings of ``The Halos of Christ,'' and several
preliminary sketches. &QL;

   National Geographic Puts Atlas Online
</P>
<P>
   With its newly published seventh edition of the Atlas of the
World, the National Geographic Society not only puts the whole
world in your hands but also allows you to keep up with it.
</P>
<P>
   A new interactive atlas, available on the Web at
www.nationalgeographic.com/mapmachine, will record the latest
geographical and political changes so that users can download maps
and paste them into their atlases. This feature will be available
by the end of the month, according to Allen Carroll, the society's
chief cartographer.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-November, there were two changes: the Black Canyon of
the Gunnison in Colorado, formerly a national monument, was
expanded and became a national park, and the height of Mount
Everest was increased from 29,028 to 29,035 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh edition, published this month, is a complete
reworking of the sixth edition, which was first published in 1990
and subsequently revised.
</P>
<P>
   It takes account of such major changes as the renaming of Zaire
(now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the creation of the Nunavut
Territory in Canada and the redrawing of provincial boundaries in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the atlas, which sells for $125, roams beyond
the strictly cartographic, with articles on such subjects as
climate, economy, tectonics, cultures and energy. All told, there
are 280 pages of maps and text plus a 134-page index with 140,000
entries.
</P>
<P>
   Those who prefer more rather than less will be cheered to know
that the Web site has two million entries. Some are variations on
place names (separate entries for Florence and Firenze, for
example); others are place names that that simply could not be
included even in a large-format atlas.

   Juneau Votes to Charge Cruise Passenger Fees &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Juneau, Alaska, last month approved by a 5-to-2 ratio
an initiative to charge each cruise ship passenger $5 for visiting
their city. The result came three months after a guilty plea by the
Royal Caribbean International cruise line to charges of dumping
pollutants into Alaskan waters. A similar measure failed three
years ago, Mayor Dennis W. Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said that despite apologies to three southeastern Alaska
cities by the president of Royal Caribbean, the residents remained
outraged. The line, which agreed in court to pay $18 million in
fines, pleaded guilty to polluting coastal waters around the United
States; this included dumping dry-cleaning chemicals and other
toxic wastes into a channel within the Juneau city limits and
dumping oily bilge water into a canal between Skagway and Haines.
</P>
<P>
   The convention and visitors bureau in Juneau, the state capital,
estimates that nearly 600,000 cruise passengers visited the city in
the 1999 season _ May through September _ and that they accounted
for most of the $90 million in economic activity generated by
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Caribbean islands levy port charges on ships based
on passenger totals, cruise lines operating in Alaska may challenge
the user fee on the basis that it is too narrow: visitors arriving
by plane or car are not similarly surcharged.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansen, president of the North West CruiseShip Association,
based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said that the group would
examine its constitutionality. ``There may be some legal issues
with a narrow, targeted fee,'' Hansen said. ``On another level,
what is the money going to be used for: dock development, tourism
improvements or just for the city's operating budget?''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said that a regulation, to be effective March 1, was being
written on the basis of the referendum. He said that the income
would be spent on infrastructure improvements related to the cruise
industry, possibly including landscaping.  &QL;

   Mount Vernon to Mourn Washington Again
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18, on the 200th anniversary of George Washington's
funeral, visitors to Mount Vernon will see a re-creation of the
services, the last of many events commemorating the bicentennial of
Washington's death at Mount Vernon on Dec. 14, 1799. More than 250
people, including descendants of original mourners, will dress in
18th-century mourning attire for the re-enactment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The event will begin at 10:30 a.m. with readings of contemporary
tributes accompanied by period music. At 11 a.m., the funeral
procession will start, with 12 people portraying the principal
mourners. They will be accompanied by Colonial soldiers with arms
reversed, the gun barrels pointed downward (an 18th-century custom
at military funerals), a militia band playing dirges, four
clergymen and a riderless gray horse with replicas of Washington's
saddle, holsters and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will carry a replica of his coffin, and visitors
will be able to follow the procession to the original family vault,
where they will witness the re-enactment of Episcopalian and
Masonic services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Dec. 14 through 18, Mount Vernon will be in mourning.
Historic interpretation for these days will feature information
about Washington's death, funeral preparations and the effect of
his death on the nation. The replica coffin will be on view in the
large dining room Dec. 17 and 18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon, 16 miles south of Washington, D.C., is open daily,
including Christmas Day. Admission: $8, $7.50 for those 62 and
above and $4 for ages 6 to 11. Information: (703) 780-2000, or on
the Internet at www.mountvernon.org and www.gwashington1999.org.

EUROPEAN TUNNELS FAULTED FOR INADEQUATE RESCUE SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, France, Italy)  (For release Sunday, Nov. 28) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Even self-assured drivers can feel pangs of
anxiety after driving miles through the dusky phosphorescence of an
Alpine tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   But after two deadly tunnel fires this year _ 39 people killed
in March in the Mont Blanc tunnel between France and Italy, and 12
people killed in May in an Austrian tunnel _ European officials
have also become nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, travelers were trapped in excruciating heat and
poisonous smoke. It took rescue workers two days to control the
Mont Blanc fire and 15 hours to extinguish the one in the Tauern
tunnel in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after numerous investigations, a growing number of European
traffic experts argue that rescue systems are not always adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, driving through tunnels is twice as safe as
driving on the open road. There are more restrictions against
lane-changing and other maneuvers that increase the likelihood of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But tunnel accidents can be nightmarish. Rescue operations are
difficult and there isn't much time: Smoke spreads through a tunnel
at 6.5 to 26 feet a second. The average person in a tunnel accident
can usually walk about four feet a second.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 20 major European tunnels by ADAC, Germany's
equivalent of the AAA, concluded that only 12 had ``good'' or
``adequate'' systems for coping with fires. Eight tunnels were
either ``dubious'' or ``unsatisfactory.'' The most frequent
criticisms were shortages of adequate escape routes, emergency
stopping areas and ventilation systems capable of confining smoke
to limited areas.
</P>
<P>
   A more informal survey of the 10 biggest Alpine tunnels, by the
German magazine Motor Presse, noted that five offered no space to
turn cars around, which is crucial for allowing rescue workers to
gain access. The survey gave only the St. Gotthard tunnel in
Switzerland a five-star rating. Five tunnels got two stars.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into the Mont Blanc disaster revealed many
problems. The seven-mile-long tunnel, more than 30 years old, has
no exit routes or side tunnels and is equipped with an aging
ventilation system that could not draw the smoke out.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue efforts were also bogged down by poor communications:
Officials on the French and Italian ends had different
communications equipment. By the time tunnel supervisors realized
they had a serious fire _ a truck had caught fire in the middle of
the tunnel _ heat was rising toward 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit and
workers couldn't get near the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Experts argue that while most of the big European tunnels are
safer than Mont Blanc, many need upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   The ADAC survey, carried out by an engineering consulting firm
called Deutsche Montan Technology, concluded that 16 out of the 20
tunnels surveyed had dubious or unsatisfactory escape routes. Only
two _ the St. Gotthard and Seelisberg tunnels in Switzerland _ were
rated as having ``very good'' escape passages.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-mile St. Gotthard is one of the only tunnels in Europe
that has a separate evacuation tunnel, which is connected to the
main one every 820 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The ADAC study did not include the Mont Blanc, which will remain
closed at least until sometime next year. But it concluded that
half of the tunnels in the study were not equipped with ventilation
adequate for firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   All major tunnels have extensive ventilation, often pushing
fresh air up from below and removing engine exhaust from above. But
only a few systems are powerful enough to redirect air flow and
contain smoke in a major fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Aberle, the engineer at Deutsche Montan Technology who
coordinated the survey, and his team concluded that one of the
worst ventilation systems was in the Tauern Tunnel, which
experienced its fire last May a few weeks after the survey was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ADAC ranked three tunnels as worst over a broad range of
criteria that includes monitoring systems, ventilation and escape
routes. They were the Fourviere tunnel in France, the Grand St.
Bernard between Switzerland and Italy and the Felbertauern in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Other traffic experts warn against placing too much value on a
single ranking. Indeed, Motor Presse gave the Felbertauern tunnel
in Austria a fairly positive three-star rating because it provides
areas for vehicles to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Mont Blanc and Tauern disasters, officials
are tightening standards. The European Commission is pushing
countries to adopt common standards and systems, to avoid the
babel-like confusion that occurred at Mont Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic experts have also concluded that drivers need
training. In principle, people should get out of their cars and
head for the nearest exit as soon as they see heavy smoke. Yet at
Mont Blanc, more than 30 people died simply sitting in their cars.
(Several people who were not in cars died as well.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Evacuation has to be in the first five to seven minutes,''
said Bernd Thamm, who oversees tunnel equipment and management at
Germany's Federal Highway Research Institute near Cologne. ``We
have to train people not to stay in their cars.''

CLINTON URGES SERBIA TO END DICTATORSHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Standing in the historic Nevski Square teeming
with enthusiastic Bulgarians, President Clinton on Monday called on
Serbia to follow the path of this former Communist stronghold and
cast aside its dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered encouragement to this new democracy, still
struggling to turn its freedoms into economic wealth, and
acknowledged the difficulties it faced during and after the
U.S.-led bombing campaign against neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president's 10-day trip through Europe's troubled southeast
ends Tuesday with a stop in Kosovo, where he will urge the ethnic
Albanian Kosovars to stop their reprisals against Serbs and work
toward reconstruction of the war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of flag-waving Bulgarians pressed into the square to
see the first U.S. president to visit their country. The warm
welcome was in contrast to the violence that marred his visit to
Greece, where many people also opposed the West's bombardment of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But the message was as much for Serbians as for Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told that during the recent war you could actually hear
some of the bombs falling in Serbia from this square. Tonight, I
hope the people of Serbia can hear our voices when we say, if you
choose as Bulgaria has chosen, you will regain the rightful place
in Europe that Mr. (Slobodan) Milosevic has stolen from you and
America will support you, too,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-led campaign sent war jets and missiles over Bulgarian
territory. An errant NATO bomb even landed in the Sofia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must give all the people in this region a unifying magnet
that is stronger than the pull of old hatreds that has threatened
to tear them apart over and over again. Your neighbor, Serbia,
should be part of that bright and different future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president again stated his support for the expansion of the
European Union into this region and for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to keep its ``doors open to those democratic nations
here who are able to meet their obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton voiced support for EU and NATO membership to
President Petar Soyanov and Prime Minister Ivan Kostov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to supporting Bulgaria over the long run _
economically, politically, militarily,'' Clinton said before a
session with Soyanov.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise
of the Soviet Union, several former Warsaw Pact powers continue to
struggle economically. Democracy has yet to translate into
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe's sanctions against Yugoslavia and Iraq have hurt
Bulgaria's economy, which already was struggling after the collapse
of Communism. A new centrist government brought the nation's
hyperinflation rate to 1 percent in 1998 compared to more than 500
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria also is battling organized crime and its reputation as
an arms merchant to rebels and insurgents around the world. The
government has initiated several reforms. The White House announced
the Overseas Private Investment Corp. will start a new $150 million
Southeast Europe Investment Fund with pledges from other sources
and will extend a $200 million line of credit to the southeast
Europe region.
</P>
<P>
   Stoyanov encouraged the crowd to stay on the path of democracy.
``We have to go it to the end,'' he said to cheers from the throng.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must keep our courage,'' Stoyanov told the crowd. ``The
people of Eastern Europe should not allow their dreams and hopes
raised by the fall of the Berlin Wall to give away to fatigue and
disillusionment, and the people of Western Europe, on the other
hand, should not allow their enthusiasm after the lifting of the
Iron Curtain to give way to indifference and egoism.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national security
adviser, said the Kosovo campaign was an important moment for
Bulgaria. The government backed the NATO effort despite opposition
from the people. However, public opinion shifted to the
government's position, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, from the people I've talked to here, this was a very
important watershed for the way Bulgaria thinks about the future,''
Berger said of a nation that was cast into the Soviet Union's
sphere after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Serb opposition leaders view Bulgaria as a model for
a democracy they want for their own homeland.
</P>
<P>
   In a trip already fraught with security concerns, the president
will take his entourage to NATO-controlled Kosovo in defiance of
Milosevic. The United States maintains Kosovo remains a province of
Serbia and has refused to support the independence wanted by
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will visit on Tuesday with some of the 6,000 U.S. troops
stationed as part of the peacekeeping force. The president will
skip a planned stop in Macedonia and fly directly to Pristina. He
also will meet with Kosovo and NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a difficult winter, but it will be a hell of a
lot better than last winter when the Kosovars were being killed,
raped and driven from their homes,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hill, the national security council's expert on southeast
Europe, said a recent conference between the United States and
European nations netted $1 billion in pledges, including $158
million from the United States, for a United Nations operation to
rebuild the civic institutions there.
</P>
<P>
   The president also has visited Turkey, Greece and Italy during
his journey.

air fare to the place involved. Are the hotels terrible? Is the
flight aboard Aero Mysterioso? How do packages work?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not always obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A travel package commonly involves three components: air travel,
transfers from and to the airport, and hotel room. There may be
more baubles: a half-day city tour, or a free travel bag, or a map
or, perhaps least persuasive, discount coupons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Hotel Monaco in Seattle, a Kimpton boutique hotel, a Wrap
It Up Package includes room, a holiday music CD, two Starbucks
drink coupons and overnight valet parking, plus free gift-wrapping
during a guest reception. The ``package'' really boils down to the
room because the reception is a Kimpton standard. The one-night
package costs $159 to $195, depending on the room; the regular
price is $125 to $180.
</P>
<P>
   I took apart two packages to price the components. Both were
offered under their apparent market value.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror Lake Inn, an AAA four-diamond resort at Lake Placid,
N.Y., has a ``ski and spa'' package: a room for two for two nights,
breakfast from the restaurant menu, two two-day lift tickets for
nearby Whiteface Mountain and one spa treatment each. The resort
has an indoor pool, hot tubs, saunas and steam rooms, and in
winter, ice skating on Mirror Lake, with evening bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   The package price for two people is $518, plus 7 percent tax and
tips. The package is available from Nov. 28 to Dec. 16, Jan. 4 to
13, and Jan. 18 to Feb. 10, Sundays to Wednesdays only. So it's the
wintertime, excluding holiday weekends.
</P>
<P>
   This inn has 128 rooms, 19 of them suites. Package buyers get
the regular rooms, with views of the lake and Adirondacks beyond.
The cold-call weekday rate in the period is $125 to $150 a night,
single or double. Basing the nonpackage price on the least
expensive room, that puts the two-night pretax rate at $250.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteface Mountain said that two-day lift tickets bought there
will be $84 a person, bringing the cost for two people to $168. The
inn's ``hearty Adirondack breakfasts'' are given an average value
of $11 by the hotel, making that total $44 for two people for two
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   The spa treatment is limited to $110 a person. This might be an
80-minute Swedish massage ($100) or stone therapy ($110). One
treatment each, total $220.
</P>
<P>
   The components add up to $682, meaning that the package price
for two days is cheaper by $164. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Ed Weibrecht Jr., an owner of the inn, said he negotiates a
wholesale price on the lift tickets. But he says he wants people to
sample his resort when there is space for them. ``Eighty percent of
our business is repeat or referral,'' he said in an interview. ``We
don't cut corners on our packages. If you have a great experience,
you come back. A place like ours cannot exist on one-shot
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrabax, an overseas tour operator with offices in New York,
Miami and Los Angeles, is offering Colors of Spain, an eight-night
escorted tour starting in Madrid and going by bus to Cordoba,
Seville, Granada and the Costa del Sol. It leaves 18 times from
Dec. 3 to April 7, but not Dec. 23. The overall cost, with air
fare, is $949 for each of two people in a hotel room; this does not
count $55 a person in airport fees and departure taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The price includes hotels, buffet breakfasts each day, the bus
trip, one lunch and three dinners, and transfers from the airport
to the hotel in Madrid and back.
</P>
<P>
   Petrabax's brochure gives the land cost as $1,047 for two
people, or $523.50 each. Subtracting this from the $949 package
price leaves $425.50 a person for the air fare. Petrabax has annual
contracts for New York flights with Delta, Iberia and Continental.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Specifying the same Friday departures and Sunday returns, Delta
quoted $358 on Nov. 15 as the cheapest advance purchase round-trip
New York-Madrid air fare; this also omits airport fees and
departure taxes. Petrabax at this point is profiting by at least
$67.50, and since seats are cheaper by the dozen, probably more.
</P>
<P>
   Getting from the airport to the Madrid hotel, the Agumar, would
cost $20 to $30, including luggage at 35 cents a bag and tip.
</P>
<P>
   Petrabax uses mostly two-star hotels. The Agumar room rate, with
no breakfast and without the 7 percent tax, amounts to $152 a night
for two people; for three nights, $456. Two nights at the Porta
Coeli in Seville, come to $292; two nights at the Melia Costa del
Sol in Torremolinos come to $162; a night at the Gran Luna in
Granada, $84. Rough total for eight nights' lodging, $994. Half of
this, representing the cost for one person, would be $497.
</P>
<P>
   Buffet breakfasts are estimated by Petrabax itself at $10 each,
so add $80 a person. It puts the cost of dinners in Seville,
Torremolinos and Granada at $30 each, so add $90, and luncheon in
Seville, $20. Again, the company's estimate puts the city tour of
Madrid at $27 a person; of Cordoba and the Great Mosque, at $55; of
Seville, $45, and of Granada and the Alhambra, $45.
</P>
<P>
   A substitute of sorts for the over-the-road bus with tour
director is an Avis car rental for nine days. Avis International
has a promotional rate of $116 for a ``B'' group manual-drive car,
one similar to an Opel Corsa, when picked up in downtown Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Mileage is free; the value added tax is 16 percent, and the
total comes to $134.56; half of this is $67. (If collision damage
waiver is added, the cost for the nine days is $120.96, and the VAT
is then added to all, for a total of $247.87.)
</P>
<P>
   The land package adds up thus: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Half of two airport transfers, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   average.......................................$25
</P>
<P>
   Half of eight hotel nights,  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7 percent tax not included.....................497
</P>
<P>
   Eight buffet breakfasts........................80
</P>
<P>
   Three dinners, tip not included................90
</P>
<P>
   One lunch, tip not included....................20
</P>
<P>
   Four tours.....................................172
</P>
<P>
   Avis rental, half, no CDW.....................67
</P>
<P>
   TOTAL........................................$951
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So two travelers putting it together for themselves would be
paying $951 each for the land arrangements, plus $358 air fare
each, for a total of $1,309, against the operator's charge of $949
a person. The company uses its plus on the air tickets to subsidize
the land travel, said Joachim Pradas, the head of Petrabax's New
York office.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Rattner Heilman, author of ``Unbelievably Good Deals and
Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over
50'' (Contemporary Books) considers package trips good value for
travelers of all ages. ``You end up paying a lot less because of
the group rates and special air fares,'' Ms. Heilman said. ``The
down side is that there is no serendipity, no off-the-road
discovery.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heilman says to be sure that the major components are
attractive to you. Don't buy a package for which a big element is a
trip on horseback if you cannot ride a horse. The balance between
program and ``days at leisure'' _ the phrase of art for being left
alone _ can also affect a choice. If you prefer to visit art
galleries rather than cathedrals, you may want a package with more
than a few unscheduled hours.

   Fiery Seasonal Welcome
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've read that in Switzerland for the summer solstice and St.
John the Baptist's birthday, huge burning bales of hay are rolled
down the mountainside. Does this practice, depicted in the painter
Anselm Kiefer's work, still take place, and where? _ Brad Burris,
Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. A remnant of the tradition can be found in Europe and Canada,
where bonfires are lighted atop hills to welcome either spring or
summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for Switzerland, there's an annual celebration called
Sechselaeuten in Zurich; in 2000, the date is April 8. Accompanied
by bands, guild members in historical costumes parade through the
city. In early evening, a snowman filled with wadding and
firecrackers is set afire. The faster the snowman is consumed, it
is said, the faster spring arrives.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, bonfires are lighted everywhere to celebrate Swiss
National Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the Swiss
confederation in the 14th century. Information: (212) 757-5944 or
on the Web at www.myswitzerland.com.
</P>
<P>
   The observance closest to home is in Quebec, whose patron saint
is St. John. There are bonfires on June 23 or 24, primarily along
the St. Lawrence River. In Montreal on the June 23, there will be a
big parade followed by fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Theft at London Hotel
</P>
<P>
   Q. While in London in August my daughter had items worth several
hundred dollars stolen from her hotel room. We were assured by the
hotel manager that insurance would cover the loss. However,
repeated inquiries have not been answered. Whom do I turn to? Is
there a Better Business Bureau or hotel organization? _ Rudolf
Hofmann, M.D., Dayton, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   A. Short of seeking relief in court, you can request help from
the London Tourist Board and the British Hospitality Association.
Note, though, that neither group's actions have the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   If a hotel repeatedly fails to resolve complaints
satisfactorily, the board might stop promoting it, said Alex
Brannen, a tourist board spokesman. That means the hotel may be
dropped from a list of 400 to 500 member hotels available to guests
inquiring by phone, on the Web and at information centers.
</P>
<P>
   Guests with a complaint should write to the London Tourist
Board, Glen House, Stag Place, London, England SW1E 5LT, or fax
(44-171) 932 0222.
</P>
<P>
   Both the tourist board and the British Hospitality Association
emphasized that all thefts should be reported to the police,
because, among other things, victims will need a crime number to
pursue insurance claims. They also stressed that hotel thefts were
rare.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitality association is an organization of 25,000 hotel
and catering companies, pubs and B&AMP;Bs. Martin Couchman, its deputy
chief executive, said that in cases of negligence by a hotel (say,
the disappearance of an item put in a safe or luggage left with a
porter), the hotel was responsible for the missing item's current
worth. But if, for example, a thief breaks into a room, the hotel's
responsibility is limited to 50 pounds per article ($81 at 61 pence
to the dollar), with a maximum payment of 100 pounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints to the British Hospitality Association should be sent
to Queens House, 55-56 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3BH;
(44-171) 404 7744, fax (44-171) 404 7799.

<TEXT>
<P>
   STARI TRG, Yugoslavia _ Bairam Bala stood on the concrete
foundations of what was once his house, surrounded by ragged edges
of shelled and collapsed walls, near the burned and rusted remnants
of his belongings that were gathered neatly in a pile for some
Westerner, who will never come, to inventory and make good his
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Myftar Haxha has his own wretched pile of post-tragedy trash,
and so does Behram Mernica. They walk forlornly around the twisted
remains of washing machines and ovens, television sets and tool
kits, lamps and bedsprings, as Kosovo's winter closes in.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost everything, they say, and that is indisputable.
Their ultimately victorious fight against the Serbs, in this
utterly devastated little village, began in the summer and autumn
of 1998 when the Serbs began to attack the Kosovo Liberation Army
in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   This Albanian village _ the name means ``old market'' _
overlooks part of the Trepca mines, one of the few economically
important sites in Kosovo. So it became strategic territory, and it
was badly shelled.
</P>
<P>
   What survived the fighting in 1998 was obliterated last April,
after another Serbian offensive prompted a 78-day bombing war from
NATO on behalf of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. These men and their
families fled to the surrounding hills _ only a few left Kosovo _
and returned in July to this blasted landscape, where their fathers
had lived before them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to visit Kosovo on Tuesday to celebrate
Thanksgiving with American soldiers at their huge, fortified base
at Camp Bondsteel. But having won the war to save people like those
in Stari Trg, the West is moving slowly to consolidate the peace
and to help them rebuild their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything and we have nowhere else to go,'' said
Haxha, rubbing his long stubble on a face that looks 70, not 58.
``Look down there,'' he said pointing to a shattered wall marked by
smoke. ``This was my land and my house. I had a good house. I had
100,000 marks invested here,'' some $55,500 at today's exchange
rate.
</P>
<P>
   There were 30 houses here; all of them are destroyed. Only five
families live here now, Bala said. The rest, for the moment, are
scattered in other villages, or they are imprisoned or dead. Of the
approximately 250 people who lived here two years ago, at least 12
have been killed, Bala said, and two were arrested by the Serbian
forces and have not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In July, aid workers from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees came by and provided a few tents, about 13 feet square, to
keep off the rain, and people moved in. But the tents cannot be
heated.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's too cold, and there has been no other visitor to
provide them with the single warm room that the world has promised
them, let alone a winterized tent, so they have gone to squat in an
office building across the way. Now the Serbs don't frighten them,
Bala said, as much as the thought of eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be happier here in a better tent than in the office,''
Bala said. ``I'm afraid every day they will throw us out. It is an
official place. It's not for family living _ it's all concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   He, like the others, says he will rebuild here, nowhere else,
and he would like to have started by now. ``If those foreign
organizations had helped us, we could have rebuilt this year,'' he
said. ``We thought they would help with timber and roof tiles. But
now they say they will help us in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   No one offered them much after July, Haxha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said everyone would have one warm room for the winter,
and we don't have one,'' Haxha said. He has six children, two here
and four in Germany. ``They can't send me money, because there is
no bank,'' he said. ``I'm waiting for them to come. But Germany
wants to throw them out.'' Now that the war is over, Berlin and
other European capitals are eager to send the ethnic Albanian
refugees home.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, senior U.N. refugee officials were upset to hear
that no one had revisited Stari Trg, and they promised to do so.
They were relieved that the families had found their own shelter,
however uncomfortable, and said that no one would turn them out.
</P>
<P>
   The officials pointed to the progress they had made in providing
emergency shelter for so many thousands, and all the obstacles they
had overcome, from clogged borders and production delays to late
financing from governments. Some 80 percent of the U.N. refugee
agency's 16,000 emergency kits, mostly roof-quality plastic
sheeting and stoves, has been delivered, they said, though other
organizations were slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a hard winter,'' said Dennis McNamara, the
refugee agency's director here, but he promised that no one in
Kosovo would freeze to death this winter. But many thousands, like
the people of Stari Trg, will have to fend for themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bala displayed his pile of rusted rubbish. ``Everything I had I
put here,'' he said, showing the broken plates, the melted pipes,
the charred alarm clock, and the tool box with his ruined tools,
which he used when he worked as an electrician at the mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard we should write down what we lost,'' Bala said
forlornly, idly picking up the rusted runner of what had been a
child's sled. ``But I thought it's better for someone to see it.''
He paused, and then said: ``Of course, all the wooden furniture is
lost. And I think they stole the television _ I couldn't find any
parts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused again. ``But no one came to see. They gave us a paper
in July to write down damage, but nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He sobbed once, briefly, and then recovered his dignity. ``I
couldn't even save the spoons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bala, who has four children, then gestured to some nearby ruins.
``From this house, only one woman survived,'' he said. ``Her
husband, son and daughter were killed. So we should be happy we are
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Xheme Maksuti, nearly 70, was killed in the shelling. His son
Ilaz, 35, and his daughter, Saba, 22, were shot to death by the
Serbs as they tried to run away, Bala said. Only Naile Maksuti, 64,
survived, he said, but he does not know where she is.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from a local charity, the Mother Teresa Society, bring
the people of Stari Trg packets of food from time to time, with
beans, pasta and other nutritious foods originally donated by
Western and U.N. agencies. And they have promised to provide a
stove for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Haxha walked in a tight circle, rubbing the moisture from his
stubble. ``How many promises did they make us before we returned?''
he asked bitterly. ``If they piled them all up, it would make us
four-story houses.''

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

RWANDA REFUSES VISA FOR WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Belgium, Canada, Cameroon)   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Rwandan officials, angered that charges against
a top genocide suspect have been dropped, have refused to grant a
visa to the prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal
investigating the massacres of at least 500,000 people in Rwanda in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was more evidence of how relations between the
government of Rwanda and the tribunal have disintegrated since
charges against the suspect, Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, were dropped
early this month. Those tensions may make remaining prosecutions
far more difficult; 38 defendants are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's new prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, was scheduled to
visit Rwanda in the next two weeks, her first trip to the region.
Repairing relations with Rwanda is high on her agenda, an aide said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But a Rwandan official said he saw no reason for her to make the
trip to Rwanda's capital, Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her coming to Kigali before this is resolved does not sort out
our complaint,'' said Zephyr Mutanguha, the Rwandan ambassador to
the tribunal, which is in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
``This is an unfortunate mistake of the tribunal, considering what
kind of criminal this man is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan government _ now led largely by members of the Tutsi
ethnic group _ have long been impatient with the tribunal for what
it says is the slow pace of the prosecutions. This month,
government officials said they would stop cooperating entirely as a
result of the dropped charges.
</P>
<P>
   Barayagwiza, an official of the former government led by members
of the Hutu ethnic group, was charged with inciting Hutu soldiers,
militias and mobs to kill Tutsi and some moderate Hutu over a
100-day period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda dismissed the case against Barayagwiza, saying
his rights had been violated because he was held in jail too long
without trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ms. Del Ponte _ who was appointed in September and
who also oversees the war crimes tribunal for countries that once
were part of the larger Yugoslavia _ filed a request that the
appeals body review its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, a spokesman for Ms. Del Ponte, said she would still
travel to East Africa this week and hoped to persuade Rwandan
officials to allow her to visit while she is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly her intention to work out of her office in
Kigali during this trip to the region,'' Risley said. She had
applied for the visa from the Rwandan Embassy in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan government calls Barayagwiza, 49, a ``chief
architect'' of the campaign to eliminate the Tutsi minority from
Rwanda in 1994. He was the spokesman for the minister of foreign
affairs and helped found Radio Free Milles Collines, a radio
station that preached hatred against Tutsi at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Mutanguha, the Rwandan ambassador, said he was concerned that
the Appeals Chamber may release more suspects: At least three of
the 38 defendants awaiting trial have contested their imprisonment
on the same grounds as Barayagwiza did, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this has set a very unfortunate precedent,'' he
said. ``The others are of course going to claim release on the same
grounds. And the whole process of justice will look a mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also said the tribunal prosecutor _ at the
time Louise Arbour, a Canadian jurist _ had failed to inform
Barayagwiza of the charges against him and had not transferred him
promptly enough from prison in Cameroon, where he was arrested on
March 27, 1996, and detained 19 months before being delivered to
the tribunal in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Barayagwiza was charged with genocide, incitement of genocide
and crimes against humanity. He is still in jail in Tanzania while
the government of Cameroon considers his application for
extradition to Cameroon.

SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS QUESTION SAFETY OF LEADING ANTI-AIDS DRUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Stirring a furor among doctors and
researchers who treat patients infected with the virus that causes
AIDS, government officials here have been questioning the safety of
the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT, saying they suspect it may be too
dangerous to justify its use.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week to the National Assembly, Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said that the drug might be toxic and
cause some forms of cancer. ``This is a very serious finding,'' she
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments echoed the concerns of President Thabo Mbeki, who
last month requested a safety review of the drug, which has been
approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in the United
States and by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a large volume of scientific literature alleging
that, among other things, the toxicity of this drug is such that it
is in fact a danger to health,'' Mbeki said in a speech to
provincial leaders. ``These are matters of great concern to the
government as it would be irresponsible for us not to heed the dire
warnings which medical researchers have been making.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements have touched off a flurry of protests from
doctors and groups and individuals concerned about AIDS in this
country, which has one of the world's highest rates of infection
with HIV, the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS experts say concerns about the safety of AZT, particularly
for children, have been raised in the United States. One study, for
instance, found that pregnant mice treated with AZT gave birth to
babies with tumors. The relevance for humans is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing the mouse studies and others like it, the
National Institutes of Health determined in 1997 that the benefits
of the drug far outweigh the potential side effects.
</P>
<P>
   AZT is used to treat people infected with HIV and has been
particularly effective in reducing the transmission of the virus
from pregnant women to their unborn babies. One two-year study
found that a short course of AZT treatment administered to women
who did not breast-feed their babies reduced transmission of the
virus by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is toxicity, but this is not a sweet, this is a drug,''
said Dr. Joseph Perriens, who heads the care and support program of
the U.N.'s AIDS program in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``To combat a fatal disease, it is perfectly acceptable to use
drugs slightly more toxic than an aspirin,'' he said. ``AZT is a
valuable therapeutic drug. Its efficacy is a very important
consideration and needs to be taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, advocates for AIDS patients and executives from the
drug company that produces AZT, Glaxo Wellcome PLC, have urged the
government to review the scientific literature. The government,
which has vowed to battle AIDS aggressively, has promised that it
will make such a review.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tshabalala-Msimang said even if AZT proves to be safe,
it is too expensive to distribute. An estimated 3.6 million of this
country's 44 million people are infected with HIV. Treating all
those people with AZT would cost the government 10 times what it
currently spends on health care for the whle nation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the government is also looking into a new anti-AIDS
drug, which researchers say is less costly and markedly more
effective than AZT in reducing mother-to-child transmission. The
cost for two doses of the new drug, nevirapine, is about $4,
compared with $268 for the AZT regimen now used in developing
countries and $815 for the much longer and more complicated course
used in the United States and other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging results have been reported in studies of nevirapine
by American and Ugandan scientists, and studies and monitoring are
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tshabalala-Msimang said she had no choice but to assess
fully both drugs before approving their use, saying her
responsibility ``extends to ensuring that no health care
intervention has a long-term negative effect on people.''

ISRAELI SOLDIER DISCHARGED FOR RELIGIOUS OUTBURST 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The topic for the day in one Israeli army classroom
was the status of women in Judaism. Sixty soldiers sat awaiting the
lecture, part of an education series where attendance is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, Lt. Gamliel Peretz, began by citing the
traditional morning blessing in which, he said, all Jewish men
thank God for not making them women. One young soldier, the
teen-age daughter of a Reform rabbi, raised her hand to challenge
him. Not all Jews say that, she said. Some use an alternative
blessing, which thanks God for making people as they are.
</P>
<P>
   According to army records, the lieutenant, who is Orthodox, then
said, ``The Reform and Conservative are not Jews to me.'' When the
teen-ager and a friend stood to leave, the lieutenant reportedly
followed them, continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform and the Conservative caused the assimilation of 8
million Jews,'' he said, ``and this was worse than the Holocaust,
in which only 6 million people were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, not even a week after the incident, the Israeli Defense
Forces suspended Peretz and said he would be discharged from the
military.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusually swift and resolute response, in which the
Israeli army drew a clear boundary between acceptable and
unacceptable discourse on religious pluralism, a sensitive issue in
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   This boundary is not often drawn here in the Jewish homeland,
where the state religious authorities are ultra-Orthodox and do not
recognize the liberal Jewish movements to which most American Jews
belong. And so representatives of Reform and Conservative Judaism
expressed surprise and delight that their rights had been defended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Israel, where there is such inequality in status
between different streams of Judaism, it is, it seems, possible to
go too far,'' said Rabbi Richard A. Block, president of the World
Union for Progressive Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Block said that two weeks ago he faced a similar verbal assault
from a member of Parliament. He and another well-known Reform rabbi
had been invited to attend a Parliament committee meeting on
conversion. A legislator from the United Torah Judaism party
entered the committee room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started screaming,'' Block said. ``He said he wouldn't sit
with the Reformim because we've caused assimilation of millions of
Jews, worse than the Nazis. It was the same thing this officer
said, but I guess it's OK for a Knesset member.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders do not believe that Reform and
Conservative Judaism are Judaism at all, since they liberate Jews
from the divine commandments and allow them individual autonomy in
their religious observance.
</P>
<P>
   The movements are so liberal, they say, that they have caused
millions of Jews to disengage from Judaism, to assimilate and to
intermarry.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and Conservative leaders, who also fret about
assimilation and inter-marriage, contend that by adapting religion
to modern life they are instead giving millions a way to remain
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rosenblum, a spokesman for an Orthodox media resource
center, said he does not consider the lieutenant's statements on
assimilation to be ``extreme'' but condemned his comparison to the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holocaust metaphors should be basically out-of-bounds,'' he
said. On the other hand, Rosenblum said he detected ``an aura of
witchhunt in the rapidity with which Lieutenant Peretz was tried,
expelled from the army and classified as some sort of pariah
forever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday by the army, Brig. Gen. Elazar
Stern said the lieutenant had apologized for the reference to the
Holocaust but remained ``steadfast'' in his view that liberal
Judaism had caused more damage than the Nazis to the future of the
Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to the officer that when an Israeli army officer
uses the term Holocaust to describe phenomena that occur within the
Jewish people, he makes it clear he doesn't understand what the
Holocaust is, what the Jewish people is, what the state of Israel
is, or what the Israeli Defense Forces stand for,'' the general
said.

COMMENTARY: RENO'S TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Janet Reno has been an admirably independent attorney
general. Where her record is to be faulted is on civil liberties.
Whether through inexperience or insensitivity, she did not raise
her voice against harsh provisions of the 1996 Immigration Act and
other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reno faces a pointed test of her commitment to a basic
concept of due process of law: the right of an accused person to
see the evidence against him. Two immigration courts have ordered
the release of an alien imprisoned for three and a half years on
secret evidence charging him with connections to terrorism. Reno
will decide whether to accept those rulings or order his
imprisonment continued.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner is Nasser Ahmed, an Egyptian who seeks asylum in
this country. The facts of his case dramatically demonstrate the
dangers of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   When the Immigration and Naturalization Service first detained
and sought to deport Ahmed, in 1996, all it would tell him was that
it had secret evidence of his ``association with a known terrorist
organization.'' It would not name the organization.
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge, Donn Livingston, found in 1997 that on the
open record Ahmed qualified for asylum. He was a critic of the
Mubarak government in Egypt, the judge said, and if returned there
would be imprisoned and probably tortured. But on the basis of the
secret evidence presented to him, Livingston found that Ahmed could
be considered a danger to U.S. national security and so ruled
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's lawyers went to federal court to challenge the process
as unconstitutional. The INS then suddenly gave them a fuller
summary of the charges. Later it supplied a declassified version of
evidence that had been given in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material now produced should never have been
classified in the first place. One item, for example, was an
unnamed FBI agent's testimony that Ahmed should be kept in prison
because his release would make him ``more well known, lending to
his credibility.'' The only reason to keep that outrageous argument
secret was that it would embarrass the government.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the newly supplied material, the Board of Immigration
Appeals sent the case back to Livingston for a further hearing.
Ahmed was now able to rebut the charges partly disclosed to him.
Some related to his work in a Brooklyn mosque for, and other
associations with, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Muslim cleric
convicted of plotting to plant bombs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   One charge was that Ahmed had visited Abdel Rahman in prison and
brought out a letter that, when published, led to an attack by
Muslim fundamentalists on tourists in Egypt in 1996. Ahmed's
lawyers showed that many others could have brought the letter out
and that in any event it had no connection with the 1996 attack.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston concluded after the new hearing that Ahmed was not a
danger to the national security. ``Armed with a better
understanding of the government's case,'' he wrote, Ahmed ``was
successful in rebutting most of the factual allegations.'' He
warned against ``the possibilities for abuse'' in the use of secret
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The judge granted Ahmed's request for asylum, and then ordered
him released from detention while the INS appealed to the Board of
Immigration Appeals. Last week the board upheld the latter order.
It was only passing on the temporary-detention issue _ but it had
to have given some consideration to national security, because the
law bars release of anyone who is a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   A rarely used procedure allows the attorney general to overrule
the appeals board. The commissioner of immigration, Doris Meissner,
asked Reno to do so, setting aside the decision to release Ahmed
and keeping him in prison. The intention, it was said, was only to
preserve the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Ahmed has already spent more than three years in solitary
confinement. Is that now the status quo? I thought freedom was _
and the right of anyone in this country to confront his accusers.  &QL;

CHRISTIAN LEADERS CLOSE CHURCHES TO PROTEST MOSQUE DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Christian leaders closed church doors throughout the
Holy Land on Monday to protest Israel's decision to let Muslims
build a mosque near a holy site in Nazareth, the boyhood home of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, set to continue through Tuesday, is the latest
installment in a two-year-old dispute over plans to put the mosque
on a plot of land near the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth
just as the Christian community prepares for millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica is located on the site where Christians believe an
angel told the Virgin Mary that she would give birth to the son of
God.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has soured Muslim-Christian relations and threatened
to spoil the millennia celebrations in Nazareth. In October, it
appeared the conflict might keep Pope John-Paul II away. But
Vatican officials now say the pope's trip to the Holy Land will go
ahead as scheduled, sometime in March.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said they organized Monday's two-day protest,
timed to coincide with Muslim plans to lay the cornerstone of the
mosque, to let the world know that they were upset about the mosque
and about the way the dispute was solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were obliged to close our churches to make our voice
heard,'' said Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, head of the Roman
Catholic Church in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders wanted the plot of land to be used to build a
plaza for the thousands of pilgrims and tourists expected to visit
next year. Leaders of Israel's Islamic Movement said the spot
should be used to build a mosque because Shihab el-Din, a revered
medieval Muslim fighter, is buried there.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Israeli government suggested a compromise: A
mosque would be built on one-third of the lot; the rest would
become a plaza. A wall would separate the two and a police station
would be placed nearby to prevent any unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazareth municipality and the Islamic Movement accepted the
deal. On Tuesday, Muslims plan to lay the first cornerstone of the
mosque that will replace a protest tent they set up there nearly
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders, however, did not agree to the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 13 different denominations, including the Roman
Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian patriarchates, shuttered
doors to Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of
the Nativity in Bethlehem, and smaller shrines and churches
throughout Israel and the West Bank. The Nazareth basilica site
also was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was taken after talks with the two political
parties, but not after talks with us,'' said Sabbah. ``No
consultation at all was taken (with) the Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest left tourists knocking on closed doors Monday. Some
prayed outside. One nun, reduced to tears after having flown
thousands of miles to come to Bethlehem, sang ``Silent Night''
through the crack at the bottom of the Church of the Nativity
doors.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat tried to persuade
Sabbah not to close the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, a town
of 30,000 just south of Jerusalem, where residents are jittery
about any unrest that may deter pilgrims and spoil million-dollar
plans for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Internal Security minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told Arafat
``not to interfere in the internal matters of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Palestinian-controlled Islamic Trust in Jerusalem
appealed to Israeli Muslims not to lay the cornerstone in a bid to
ease tensions between Muslims and Christians in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Last Easter, those tensions erupted into violence during a Greek
Orthodox procession outside the basilica. Stories vary as to who
started the clash. Christians say Muslims sitting at the protest
tent threw stones at them as they were passing by. Muslims say the
Christians threw the stones.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, more than 50 Christians had been
injured, some hospitalized, and several Christian-owned shops had
been damaged. Church leaders accused the Israeli police of sitting
idly by during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were in the street, the army was in the street, but
they were ordered not to interfere,'' said Sabbah.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth city officials have tried to play down the conflict as
a land dispute between the government and the Islamic Trust. They
blame the Israeli authorities for creating the problem by
suggesting two years ago that a mosque should be built at the site
as part of the preparations for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders accuse Israel of suggesting the mosque as a
way to get votes from Israel's 1 million-strong Muslim population
at the expense of the much smaller Christian community, which
numbers about 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, once a predominantly Christian town, Muslims now
make up nearly 70 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought, `you are small, you do not count,''' Sabbah said
Monday. ``Being forgotten, neglected, put aside, we said we have to
speak. That is the meaning of this closure of the churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has denied it harbored ulterior motives and maintains it
was trying to find a compromise that would please everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country of interfaith coexistence. This is the major
message, '' said the security minister, Ben-Ami.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

GERMANY'S BIGGEST BUILDER FACES BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Philipp Holzmann AG, the biggest
construction company in Germany, averted bankruptcy at least
temporarily Monday night when Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stepped
in to help negotiate a compromise among banks trying to arrange a
$2.6 billion bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann has been on the brink of insolvency since last week,
when it said it had suddenly uncovered $1.3 billion in soured real
estate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Holzmann's creditor banks failed to reach
agreement on a bailout and angrily began accusing each other of
either covering up evidence of trouble or being ``inflexible'' in
coming to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it seemed the end was at hand, the German chancellor
said Monday evening that he would try to arrange a deal among the
banks and political leaders in the German state of Hesse, where
Frankfurt is located, and brought the creditors back into another
round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted bailout of Holzmann highlighted the tattered state
of ``Germany Inc.,'' the once tightly knit community of banks,
industrial companies and government officials that has
traditionally rescued ailing enterprises during bad times.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, angry bankers charged that Holzmann, which has lost
money for years, appeared to have concealed bad loans while
declaring that it was on the path to a turn-around.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann's biggest shareholder, the Belgian holding company
Gavaert, charged that the big banks should have seen the problems
as well, and threatened to sue them and Holzmann's top managers.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the finger-pointing, Holzmann's chief executive, Heinrich
Binder, gloomily confronted angry construction workers as a
bitterly cold snowstorm blanketed much of Frankfurt on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though he promised to do everything he could to keep the company
operating while in bankruptcy, Binder admitted that he ``cannot
say'' whether the company would be able to issue the next round of
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann has more than 1,200 construction sites around Germany,
and work stopped at many of them amid the bad weather and
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Because Holzmann is one of Germany's most venerable industrial
names and employs nearly 17,000 workers, the banks are under heavy
political pressure to prop it up one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, which owns 15 percent of Holzmann and holds more
than 2.2 billion marks, or $1.2 billion, in outstanding loans to
the company, had been leading the bailout and had offered to put up
about $830 million, roughly a third of what Holzmann said it
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout talks collapsed after a 15-hour meeting of
creditors on Sunday. Deutsche Bank said that ``inflexibility'' by
Commerzbank AG, Germany's fourth-largest bank, caused the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Commerzbank fired back, noting that Deutsche Bank should have
known better because one of its own top executives is chairman of
Holzmann's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of its problems was heightened Monday when rival
construction firms, including Hoch-Tief AG, asserted that they had
little interest in acquiring either all or part of Holzmann.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of Holzmann's problems is a huge portfolio of bad
real estate loans it took on in the early 1990s, when eastern
Germany was being reconstructed at a furious pace and the industry
was enjoying an extraordinary boom. Besides profiting from the
construction work itself, Holzmann financed many projects.
</P>
<P>
   When real estate prices in eastern Germany collapsed as a result
of overbuilding fueled by generous tax breaks, Holzmann found
itself with a growing amount of increasingly problematic loans.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, Holzmann is required to file for bankruptcy as
soon as its creditors decide against refinancing its debt. Binder
said earlier Monday that that would take place on Tuesday at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
   But political leaders have jumped in for a last attempt. Roland
Koch, the Christian Democratic premier of Hesse, was trying to
arrange one more round of talks and was reported to be putting
heavy pressure on publicly owned banks to contribute money toward a
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Then Schroeder said he would act as a mediator. According to
some news reports, the banks are short only about 400 million marks
of the 4.3 billion marks, or $2.3 billion, they are trying to
assemble.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Bild Zeitung, Germany's main tabloid paper,
Schroeder said the banks had a responsibility to work out a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that is important is that sufficient capital be
made available so that Holzmann can continue its work and that the
workers can continue to be paid,'' he said. Declaring himself ready
to take a lead in talks, Schroeder said he was convinced that the
shortfall in bank commitments ``can be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roland Koch, the premier of Hesse, was more pessimistic.
``It will be very difficult for Holzmann to stay alive,'' he said
shortly before the banks restarted talks Monday night.

CONGRESS MOVES TO REVERSE HMO WITHDRAWALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to stem the exodus of insurers from
Medicare's managed care program, Congress is offering companies
bonuses and other incentives to restore coverage in counties they
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   A health care measure attached to the overall budget package
would provide $4.8 billion in added spending over five years for
the so-called Medicare Plus Choice program, raising reimbursement
rates and easing rules that insurance companies complained were
burdensome and costly.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care proposal would also allow beneficiaries
deserted by an HMO to join the same plan in a nearby county, an
opportunity they did not have under the previous rules. That
provision could prove attractive to consumers willing to travel to
receive the added benefits of managed care, including prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the managed care changes hope the combination of
provisions will strengthen the overall Medicare Plus Choice program
and lure plans back into areas they deserted as well as counties
that never had HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is the overall package is going to have enough that
it will make a significant difference,'' said Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla., whose constituents experienced a significant health care
disruption when HMOs fled Polk County, the largest in his district.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, dozens of managed care plans in more than
30 states cut back their Medicare service or left the program
entirely, sending 734,000 beneficiaries scrambling for new
coverage. About 130,000 of those people lived in counties left with
no managed care option. Plans that did remain typically raised
premiums and cut benefits to the 6.2 million of Medicare's 39
million beneficiaries participating in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers and health care experts are skeptical that the
reforms will accomplish their intended goal, saying that HMO
withdrawals have been due more to market forces and competition
than to federal reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and congressional critics have
consistently argued that HMOs were already overpaid. One aide to a
Senate Democrat described the provisions as ``welfare for managed
care.'' The White House was also unhappy with the amount of money
that will flow to managed care under the bill, though it supported
the overall package of Medicare changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are provisions in here we don't believe are
justifiable,'' said Chris Jennings, President Clinton's adviser on
health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the changes will not have the
desired result since they maintain what he considers to be a flawed
payment system that ties managed care reimbursement rates to what
is paid for traditional fee-for-service. As a result, HMOs tend to
cluster in high-volume, high-cost urban areas where rates are much
higher than in more sparsely populated communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see many HMOs in medium-to-lower-cost areas,'' said
Graham, who would prefer that HMOs bid for the right to serve an
area.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers were also doubtful of the impact, but held out
hope that the changes would reverse the loss of managed care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more going on out there than just reimbursement
issues, but some believe it could make a difference for those who
have lost their coverage,'' said Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla., whose
North Florida district was rocked by HMO withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the managed care industry said the new
provisions are no panacea, but represent a first step toward
stabilizing the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prevents health plans from losing ground further,'' said
Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans. She said Congress must still do more to correct what she
sees as a widening gap between traditional Medicare reimbursement
and managed care payment.
</P>
<P>
   She disputed the claim that the plans are now overpaid and said
the constituent pressure put on Congress to make adjustments shows
how popular managed care can be with enrollees. ``The beneficiaries
themselves have made this happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Medicare changes, an HMO that enters a county with no
plan would get a 5 percent payment bonus the first year and 3
percent the second _ an incentive the government expects to cost
$300 million. The proposal also shortens the time an insurer is
barred from returning to an area once it pulls out from five years
to two years, and makes a number of other revisions sought by the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the additional money going to managed care comes
from an overall boost in fee-for-service spending called for in the
Medicare measure, since the payment rates are linked. The managed
care lobby said the plans will also benefit substantially from a
slower phase-in of rules intended to make certain the plans enroll
sick as well as healthier beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawmakers and insurers believe beneficiaries will take
advantage of the new leeway to join plans outside their immediate
county. The measure leaves it to the discretion of the HMO to
decide whether to accept them, but Ignagni believes many are open
to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the health plans are working very hard to make this
work for as many beneficiaries as possible,'' she said.

 &HT;    BCS rankings give Nebraska another chance at big dance
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virginia Tech fans: Don't make those reservations to New Orleans
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 Hokies (10-0), who finish the regular season Friday
against Boston College, received a jolt Monday from the newest Bowl
Championship Series rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech remained No. 2 in the standings after its 62-7 win
over Temple last Saturday. But Nebraska, which was 2.40 points
behind the Hokies a week ago, had closed the gap to just .63
points.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS rankings are compiled from the average of four
components: the coaches' and media polls;
</P>
<P>
   eight computer polls; strength of schedule and number of losses.
The lower the total, the higher the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The top two teams in the final BCS standings, which will be
released on Dec. 4, will play in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 for the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (11-0), which closed out its regular season
Saturday by beating Florida 30-23, remained No. 1 by a wide margin
and clinched one of the spots. But now, it appears to be
mathematically possible for a once-beaten Nebraska team to jump
over an unbeaten Virginia Tech team into the Sugar Bowl game for
the national championship. If so, it could be a public-relations
problem for BCS backers. The explanation is pretty simple. Virginia
Tech has a better average in the media's and coaches' opinion polls
(2 vs. 3) and in the computer polls (2.14 vs. 2.57), but Nebraska
has a decided advantage in the strength-of-schedule component.
</P>
<P>
   Strength of schedule is determined by determining the cumulative
won-loss records of a team's opponents (66.6 percent) and the
team's opponents' opponents (33.3 percent). The formula rewards
teams that play in stronger conferences and play tougher
non-conference schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has a schedule rating of 21, out of 114 Division I
schools, plays in tougher conference than Virginia Tech (Big 12 vs.
Big East) and its opponents have a combined record of 62-52.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's opponents to date are a combined 40-53. The
Hokies' schedule is rated No. 66. One opponent, Division I-AA James
Madison, is not counted.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule strength, divided by 25 for weighting, comes out to
be an advantage of 1.80 for Nebraska _ 0.84 to 2.64. It was enough
to pull the Cornhuskers to within a point in Monday's standings.
Virginia Tech's schedule strength figures to improve when it plays
Boston College (8-2) on Friday to finish the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But Nebraska has two more games, with Colorado (6-4) on Friday
and then against Texas (9-2) in the Big 12 championship game on
Dec. 4. Texas, the only team to beat Nebraska this season (24-20),
is No. 10 in the BCS rankings and has a schedule strength of 29.
</P>
<P>
   If Virginia Tech is passed over for the Sugar Bowl, the Hokies
would go to the Orange Bowl, where they still could get part of the
national title, if they won to go 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Sugar Bowl automatically is declared the
national champion in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   But the sports writers and broadcasters who vote in the
Associated Press poll would be free to vote for Virginia Tech.

HINGIS AND DAVENPORT AGREE: IT'S US AGAINST THEM (VENUS, SERENA AND
RICHARD)  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The women's tennis season is over, and here's one
last parting shot.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport, the top two players in
1998 and again in 1999, do not regret to inform Venus and Serena
Williams, along with their father, Richard, that rumors of the
sisters' imminent and inevitable takeover of the circuit have been
greatly exaggerated. Plus premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dead, yet,'' noted the second-ranked Davenport,
implying that any transfer of power and rank would take place over
a pair of dead bodies, hers and Hingis'.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the denouement of the season-ending Chase
Championships, in which Davenport dethroned Hingis, the top-ranked
defending champion, 6-4, 6-2, confirmed that Hingis, 19, and
Davenport, 23, are very much alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get hysterical when I read and hear that stuff about the
Williams girls taking over and being better than everyone else;
it's so ridiculous,'' Davenport said. ``I mean, look around. When
it came down to the end of the year, it was me and Martina again,
not just in this final, but also at the top of the rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport admitted that, after feeling somewhat ganged up on by
the sisters and their voluble father, who has a talent for drawing
their opponents into distracting verbal debates during major
tournaments, she and Hingis have formed their own united front.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they begrudge Venus and Serena their progress:
Both Hingis and Davenport readily admit that they and the Williams
sisters now form the most competitive quartet the sport has ever
witnessed. But earned victories are one thing, and hype, Davenport
said, is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing personal against them,'' she said, ``because we
know most of the talk is stirred up by their father. But we always
do want to make a point: that we're 1 and 2, not them, and right
now we're the ones to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare Martina and me to them; we're not close like
sisters. But we do joke before every tournament that `hey, one of
us has to win this one.' We did it here before the Chase.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters limped away from the Chase despite plans to
not only monopolize the singles final, but also sweep the doubles
event and establish themselves as the No. 1 doubles team in the
world heading into 2000. None of that transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena and I, we're both in the same boat,'' Venus said about
the intrusion of injury on their strategy for Chase Championships
glory. ``We're sinking a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, the 18-year-old U.S. Open champion, withdrew from the
Chase on the morning of her first scheduled match, hobbled, she
said, by a violently sore back. It was her fifth withdrawal this
year, setting a record of sorts for unreliability, and it rivaled
her absence from Wimbledon (flu was the official culprit that time)
for the intrigue it generated. Was she really incapacitated or
simply making the competition less complicated for Venus, who has
yet to win a Grand Slam event or a Chase championship and is, by
her own admission, in arrears when it comes to making good on her
goals?
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as meeting my goals, it was a bad year in some of
them,'' said 19-year-old Venus, whose six titles vaulted her to a
career-best third in the world, just ahead of her sister, but
didn't come at the events that count most. ``I wanted to naturally
have a higher ranking, to say the least, take home some Grand
Slams. I took home some Grand Slams, but they weren't singles.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus overlooked a neck strain through two rounds, then blamed
it for her semifinal defeat in a slugfest that conjured memories of
a loss to Hingis at the same important stage of the U.S. Open.
Cramping was the culprit on that occasion. Since being eclipsed at
the Open by Serena, Venus not only announced plans to transform her
game into a serve-and-volley masterpiece, but also threw herself
into college classes in pursuit of an associate's degree in
residential design. Twice she has demanded, and received, midweek
starts at tournaments not because she's nursing an injury but
because she prefers to spend her Mondays and Tuesdays in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   It's special treatment, sure, but to withhold permission puts
WTA Tour executives in the unflattering position of hindering the
player's public, image-enhancing attempt to blend elite athletics
and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with the Williams sisters and their agents to
make sure the tournament commitments they make are honored because
that's extremely important to the credibility of the tour,'' said
Bart McGuire, the WTA Tour's chief executive. As for the verbal
feints and jabs regarding who is best in the world and why, McGuire
has elected to leave the Hingis-Davenport and Williams-Williams
camps to have at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they're saying anything players like Chrissie
Evert and Martina Navratilova didn't think,'' he said, ``they just
didn't say it in that era. But this is a new era.'' &QL;

E-MAIL AN IMPERFECT FORM OF COMMUNICATION

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q -- I sent an e-mail to a colleague across the country, and the
next thing I knew, my boss was lecturing me about sending such an
unfriendly note. I don't think it was unfriendly, but it was direct
and businesslike. When I reread it to my boss, he seemed to
understand. Is there a way to prevent this kind of problem from
recurring? P.S.
</P>
<P>
   A -- E-mail is not a perfect form of communication, but, for
that matter, neither is a boss who lectures you.
</P>
<P>
   For communication to be truly effective, it is important for the
sender to do more than send a message. Although the message is an
obviously important part of the communication process, it is also
important for the sender to have some sensitivity to the way in
which a message is received. In face-to-face communications, it is
generally easy to see and hear the receiver's reaction, although
your manager demonstrated that this is not always the case.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail, a letter instantly arrives and its meaning, tone and
intent are greatly influenced by the mind set, mood and
expectations of the receiver. Any phrase can be easily
misinterpreted. For example, think about the different ways that
the following e-mail sentence can be read: ``This needs to be done
by Friday.'' Granted, the use of capitals can signify emphasis in
e-mail, but is that a friendly emphasis or is it yelling?
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is a terrific means of communication, but if people have
questions about the message, intonation or intent, they need to be
advised to either meet with the sender (who often is down the
hall), or at the very least pick up the phone. As for your
lecturing manager, he needs to pick up a few management classes.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I have not been with this company very long, but it is one
of the most unorganized businesses I have ever seen. In places
where systems and procedures are needed, there are none, and many
of the existing systems are long obsolete. My manager tells me that
this looseness is by design, adding that chaos can build creativity
and agility, and that companies that are too structured are left
behind. Am I off base in thinking that this makes no sense? C.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When a business is chaotic, that does not imply creativity,
nimbleness or broad thinking; rather, putting all the
rationalizations aside, the implication is that the business is a
mess.
</P>
<P>
   It makes more sense to view businesses as being arrayed on a
continuum, with the hyper-organized on one end, and the chaotic on
the other. At one extreme, the businesses are so filled with
layers, levels and policies that people can hardly breathe without
looking in a manual. And, at the other extreme, the businesses are
so void of organization that people are basically wandering around.
</P>
<P>
   In today's dynamic marketplace, it makes sense for businesses to
have a flat structure, streamlined policies, employee empowerment,
cross training and a clear focus on its mission and objectives.
That may sound chaotic when compared to an overly organized
company, but it is not chaos at all.
</P>
<P>
   Your manager is correct in asserting that overly structured
companies are left behind, but he or she needs to realize chaotic
companies sit hand in hand with them.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- As part of my job as a supervisor, I am supposed to
discipline employees for breaking the rules and committing other
infractions at work. I do not like confrontations, and this aspect
of the job has me worried. What are the ways to discipline
employees without having a confrontation? S.A.
</P>
<P>
   A -- It is not difficult to conduct disciplinary sessions with
employees, provided that you have disciplined yourself to do so in
a well-prepared, productive, open, fair and constructive fashion.
If you go into a session expecting a confrontation, that is
precisely what you will find.
</P>
<P>
   When an employee needs to be disciplined, it is important to
provide the feedback as close to the questionable behavior as
possible. Keep in mind that you will fare better if you envision
yourself as a coach, rather than a disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Base the discussion on the individual's specific behavior and
clearly express the ways in which it was unacceptable, along with
the consequences if such behavior persists. At the same time, be
sure to listen to the employee's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Let the employee suggest some methods to improve his or her
behavior in the future, and you can then provide more guidance as
to the specifics. Be sure to document the session and ask for the
employee's signature. Wrap up the discussion with positive
expectations, and give the employee positive feedback, when these
expectations are met.

   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ Iraq on Monday halted exports of
crude oil through the Turkish port of Ceyhan, effectively rejecting
a two-week extension of its oil-for-food program, the United
Nations announced. The move followed a decision by the Security
Council on Friday to extend the oil-for-food program by two weeks
instead of the customary 180 days. Some diplomats interpreted the
extension as putting pressure on the five permanent members of the
council to wrap up negotiations on a new comprehensive resolution
on Iraqi sanctions. (Summary from wires.) By Barbara Crossette.

   SCI-MEREDITH-WINE (Davis, Calif.) _ Dr. Carole P. Meredith, a
geneticist at the University of California's department of
viticulture and enology, has used a new method of unraveling the
grapevine's tangled family tree to demonstrate that several of the
world's best-known wine grapes are not pure strains but hybrids
between other varieties. Recognizing that the DNA fingerprinting
method used in forensic cases could be adapted to the vine, she has
roamed through the leading Californian and French varieties,
conducting paternity tests and establishing quite unexpected
liaisons between grapes of very different repute. By Nicholas Wade.

COALITION TO DISTRIBUTE BOOKLET TO AID GAY STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move likely to fuel debate over how secondary schools
should handle the issue of homosexuality, a coalition of medical,
mental health, educational and religious organizations announced
Monday that it would send the United States' school superintendents
a booklet informing them that there is ``no support among health
and mental health professional organizations'' for the idea that
homosexuality is abnormal or mentally unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Just the Facts Coalition, representing the American Academy
of Pediatrics, the National Education Association, the American
Psychological Association and seven other groups, said the 12-page
booklet would be mailed Tuesday to the heads of all 14,700 public
school districts in the nation. The coalition said the booklet
``provides information that will help school administrators and
educators to create safe and healthy environments in which all
students can achieve to the best of their ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The publication also expresses concerns about the potential harm
to gay students posed by ``reparative therapy'' and other
techniques intended to change sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a history-changing moment,'' said Kevin
Jennings, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight
Education Network, a New York organization devoted to ending
anti-gay bias in the schools. ``The entire mainstream education and
mental health establishment has said that it isn't lesbian, gay and
bisexual students who need to change, it is the conditions in our
schools that need to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But conservative groups attacked the booklet, saying that it was
based on politics, not science.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying they want to present factual information on
homosexuality, but we believe that they're presenting propaganda,''
said John Paulk, a homosexuality and gender analyst for Focus on
the Family, a Colorado Christian group that holds Love Won Out
conferences where reparative therapy is endorsed and participants
are taught how to combat ``pro-gay'' messages they believe children
are receiving in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Parshall, chief spokeswoman for the conservative Family
Research Council, also condemned the coalition's mailing. ``If
they're going to talk about `the facts,' here's a fact: All the
major religions of the world consider homosexuality wrong,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Duby of the National Education Association, a leading
union of schoolteachers, said the coalition was formed after
members heard about the Love Won Out conferences and decided a
response was needed. Ms. Duby, who helped create the booklet, said
the publication was approved by the education association's
leadership, including its president, Bob Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the organizations represented by the coalition, Ms. Duby
said, had already passed resolutions on their own condemning
reparative therapy and endorsing the need for ``safe environments''
for gay students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the document conflicted with any of our policies,
and in fact it was very much in keeping with the policies of our
organization,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet, ``Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &AMP;
Youth,'' is divided into short chapters, including sections on how
sexual orientation develops; reparative therapy, ``transformational
ministries'' and other religion-based efforts that try to help
homosexuals change their sexual orientation; and laws protecting
gay men and lesbians from discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the religious nature of `transformational
ministry,''' the booklet advises, ``endorsement or promotion of
such ministry by officials or employees of a public school district
in a school-related context could raise constitutional problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The publication states that ``therapy directed specifically at
changing sexual orientation is contraindicated, since it can
provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for
achieving changes in orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the organizations in the coalition contributed money to
print and distribute the booklet, as did Michael Dively, a
philanthropist and former member of the Michigan Legislature who is
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the booklet, Paulk, of Focus on the Family, said
that no scientific studies had been done on reparative therapy, and
that organizations that have ``debunked'' the technique were acting
on the basis of political motives, not scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Paulk also defended his organization's efforts to promote in
schools the conservative view of homosexuality as abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents don't want their children being taught about
homosexuality, period,'' Paulk said. ``We believe that
homosexuality is something that should be talked about in the home.
But in the worst-case scenario, if it's going to be presented in
public schools, we want equal time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Hunter, director of public affairs for the American
Association of School Administrators, which represents public
school superintendents and is a member of the coalition, said his
organization agreed with the message of the booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the publication is likely to be used by school
administrators ``based on community values.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There are many communities in this country that are just too
conservative for that, and I trust superintendents to know their
communities,'' Hunter said. ``On the other hand, when push comes to
shove, occasionally you have to stand up, and we would hope they
would stand up for tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the coalition that endorsed the booklet are the
American Federation of Teachers, the National Association of Social
Workers, the National Association of School Psychologists and the
Interfaith Alliance Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the booklet can be obtained by a call to any of the
organizations that are participating in the effort, a spokesman
said.

OLDER BULGARIANS LOOK BACK ON COMMUNIST ERA WITH FONDNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Eva Dimitrova's grandmother reminisces fondly
about the communists, who the Dimitrova family believes took better
care of the Bulgarian people than the current, democratic
government.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Baltova's mother tells her this common complaint: ``Before
1989, we had many things, but nothing to buy. Now, there are lots
of things to buy when you go into a shop, but you don't have any
money.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 16-year-old schoolmates, Eva and Elena? They want out _
out of Bulgaria and out of the dismal future they envision having
in this economically-troubled, post-communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nasty here in Bulgaria right now,'' Baltova said, sitting
in a Dunkin' Donuts and smoking as she looked with distaste at the
run-down buildings on Sofia's main boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have money. Our parents' wages are really low.
Our government ministers are not loyal to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to work abroad _ definitely not in Bulgaria,'' added
Baltova, who is studying Spanish so she can get a job in Spain. ``I
don't think there are good career choices here, and we would not
make any money if we stayed in Bulgaria.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after communism fell in Central and Eastern Europe,
Bulgaria is still suffering transition pains. Unemployment is 14
percent, and locals and economists fear the rate will grow as state
companies are privatized, and the new owners downsize the
communist-level workforces.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged people are finding themselves shut out of the new
job market, which is increasingly requiring English language and
computer skills. Elderly people are struggling to survive on
pensions as low as $30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton, on the first state visit to Bulgaria by
a sitting US president, extolled the democratic reforms Bulgaria
has introduced since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, locals wonder
when _ and if _ they will feel the economic benefits of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice'' that Clinton is visiting, and ``I hope the
visit will bring something good to Bulgaria,'' said 72-year old
Nadezhda Nikulova, a retired teacher. ``But the president should
see for himself how people here really do live. Because it's really
hard,'' she said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a wildly enthusiastic welcome from some 30,000
Bulgarians who packed the area near historic Nevsky cathedral
Monday to hear Clinton and the Bulgarian president, Petar Stoyanov,
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton! Clinton!'' the crowd yelled, waving Bulgarian and US
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that ``when the Cold War ended, it took
much longer for the ground here to thaw,'' and that ``some here may
feel left behind while others race ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to remember what you left behind _ a police state
with no reason for disappointment, because there was no hope,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stay the course, Bulgaria will be a place where young
people can make their dreams come true,'' the president said. ``I
know it may seem hard now, but someday, you will look back on this
time and say, `when we were young, we brought Bulgaria back to
freedom.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked Bulgarians for their help during the war in
Kosovo. While Bulgaria was damaged economically by the war against
its trading partner Serbia, Bulgaria allowed NATO to use its air
space.
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings with Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov,
Clinton was pressed to support Bulgaria's NATO accession hopes.
Both leaders agreed that NATO membership for Bulgaria was a high
priority, a senior Clinton administration official said, recapping
the meeting. ``You can make a compelling case for NATO membership
in the next wave'' in 2001, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria has long been the region's laggard in making the
transition from communism to a democracy and market economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nation, which once wanted to become a Soviet Republic,
doesn't share the hatred that other former Soviet satellites had
for the communists. There was no Russian invasion here, as the
Czechs had in 1968 and the Hungarians had in 1956, to create
Bulgarian animosity toward its Black Sea neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgarians, especially older nationals, often refer to the
Russians as their ``blood brothers,'' as the two share the Orthodox
Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   With little impetus for economic reform and the loss of Russian
support, Bulgaria hit a drastic low in early 1997. The banking
system was near collapse, and people stood in bread lines.
Hospitals were forced to do only emergency surgery, as anesthesia
was too expensive to buy with rapidly devaluating Bulgarian leva,
the local currency.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis brought Bulgarians to the streets, demanding the
resignation of the previous Socialist government. New elections
brought the reform-talking Stoyanov government.
</P>
<P>
   The Stoyanov government began _ belatedly, say would-be foreign
investors _ to privatize old state-owned companies. The
International Monetary Fund imposed strict fiscal policies in
exchange for its assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On a macro-economic level, investment analysts and
businesspeople say, Bulgaria has made impressive progress.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is low, and there are hopes that the Gross Domestic
Product might actually grow next year, said Ken Lefkowitz, an
analyst with the Sofia office of EPIC investments.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals here say they are not yet feeling the
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really poor, and crime is high. For most of society, I
don't think there is anything positive'' that came from the
departure of the communists, complained a 67-year-old man who would
give only his first name, Velin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for people, because they haven't learned to take
care of themselves,'' said 50-year-old Desislava Mihailova as she
collected free mineral water from a local spring. ``We were used to
having someone else take care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoyanov, speaking to the crowd at Nevsky, urged his countrymen
to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize the transition has been more difficult, more
painful, and slower than we would have imagined,'' Stoyanov said.
But ``regardless of the difficulties and disillusionments, maybe .
. . the path is clear. It lies straight ahead and we have to go to
the end.''

CLINTON BESTOWS THANKS AND ENCOURAGEMENT ON BULGARIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ President Clinton thanked the Bulgarians
Monday for supporting NATO's campaign against Slobodan Milosevic in
nearby Yugoslavia and urged the struggling nation to stay the
course of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people packed the central square here under the
glittering Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky _ the same spot where
mass rallies 10 years ago led to the overthrow of the Communist
regime _ and celebrated the visit with music and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud to be the first American president to visit
Bulgaria _ a free Bulgaria,'' Clinton told the crowd in a 45-minute
speech at dusk. ``I am proud to stand in this place where voices
were silenced for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Bulgaria late Sunday at the start of the
second week of his European tour, which ends with a trip to Kosovo
on Tuesday. The visit here was intended to reward Bulgaria for
letting NATO fighter planes use its air space in the Kosovo
campaign last spring, to offer encouragement and to send a message
to the Yugoslavs only 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am told that during the recent war you could actually hear
some of the bombs falling in Serbia from this square,'' Clinton
said. ``Tonight, I hope the people of Serbia can hear our voices
when we say if you choose as Bulgaria has chosen, you will regain
the rightful place in Europe Mr. Milosevic has stolen from you, and
America will support you too.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of people _ most of whom were taught of the evils of
America's imperialist ways when they were young _ roared with
approval and shouted Clinton's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be dangerous to talk to foreigners,'' said Kiril
Manov, 70, a retired lawyer who was bundled up against the chilly
evening air. ``We used to learn about the evils of America. Never
did we think an American president would stand here.''
</P>
<P>
   During his visit Monday, Clinton laid a wreath at a soldiers'
memorial, spoke with a small group of college students over a lunch
of tabbouleh and skewered chicken, and slipped out to a jazz club
with President Petar Stoyanov. During his visit to Kosovo, Clinton
is to meet military commanders, opposition leaders and American
troops, and is expected to urge the Albanians of Kosovo to set
aside revenge as they rebuild after the war. It will be the
president's first trip to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important that Kosovo, in effect, not become
the mirror image of Serbia,'' he said in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, the president held out the possibility of
NATO membership for Bulgaria in the coming years and thanked the
nation for allowing the alliance's jets to streak over Sofia during
the air campaign in Kosovo. ``You stood with NATO,'' the president
said. ``I know it was very hard for you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Clinton's visit was designed to leave a measure
of hope in a country still struggling with the difficult transition
from dictatorship to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to remember what you left behind,'' said Clinton,
standing before the majestic, gold-domed cathedral. ``A police
state with no room for disappointment, because there was no hope
for improvement. When nobody felt left behind because no one was
allowed to get ahead. When there were no dreams and some Bulgarians
were even robbed of their very identities, forced to change their
names.''
</P>
<P>
   The border with Yugoslavia lies just 30 miles to the east of
Bulgaria's capital, so close that a handful of NATO bombs that
veered off course actually landed here.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions against Yugoslavia, a onetime trading partner,
have had a crippling effect on Bulgaria's economy, which already
suffered from a steep drop in living standards and the high
inflation that followed the Soviet era, a period when Bulgaria was
one of the most Stalinist of the East Bloc countries. American
support is considered all important to the people here, where jobs
are difficult to come by, salaries are low, and gray cement-block
architecture stands as a reminder of a communist system that left
little room for initiative. Clinton did not bring any big offers of
aid, but he talked of a continued partnership with Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people living here are desperate with the economic
situation,''' said Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for
Regional and International Studies in Sofia. ``This visit is a sign
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how Snezhana Popova saw it.
</P>
<P>
   She stood in the back of the crowd with two tiny flags in her
hand, one American and one Bulgarian. Clinton's visit, she said,
had to help make things better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get a well-paying job here,'' she said.
``The salaries are very low here.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark that most encouraged her came midway through
Clinton's speech when he talked of plans to encourage more U.S.
companies to do business in Bulgaria and, speaking to the cameras,
urged investors to come to what he called ``a wonderful country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria is making a push for entry into the European Union, an
effort Clinton said ought to come to fruition one day. In closed
meetings with Stoyanov and Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, Clinton
discussed Bulgaria's effort to downsize and modernize its
Soviet-era military, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   As he encouraged Bulgarians to continue their reform efforts,
the president reminded them of the long road the United States had
traveled to get democracy right. He said it had taken America more
than two centuries ``to overcome slavery and civil war, depressions
and world wars, discrimination against women and ethnic and
religious minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria was allied with the Germans in both world wars, but it
came to the aid of its Jews when the Nazis tried to send them to
concentration camps. Today, the country has a legacy of religious
and ethnic tolerance that Clinton singled out for praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must help all of southeastern Europe choose freedom and
tolerance and community,'' he said. ``We must give all the people
in this region a unifying magnet that is stronger than the pull of
old hatreds that has threatened to tear them apart over and over
again.''

DOLPHINS HAD WATCHED THE TAPES, HAD PATRIOTS ALL FIGURED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There are some mysteries surrounding the Patriots, such
as why clutch wide receiver Troy Brown is ever on the sideline in a
key third-down situation and inconsistent Tony Simmons is ever in
the game on a key play.
</P>
<P>
   But to opponents who study the Patriots' offense closely, the
mysteries are few. The Miami Dolphins' Terrell Buckley claimed he
was able to pick off a Drew Bledsoe pass Sunday because he had
studied tape and knew what Ben Coates likes to do on his signature
pass pattern _ go 6-10 yards downfield, usually on third down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a nice read off Coates when he came out on his route,''
said Buckley. ``The previous play to that, Coates had run an `in'
route, and you just count on what they might do next. You look at
Coates when you're doing your film study and you see what he likes
to do. He might run an `in' one time, or an `out' and then run a
curl next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley went into more detail. Look very closely at tape of the
Patriots' offense, and how Coates is used in particular, the Miami
cornerback went on, and it soon becomes clear what New England
likes to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots basically use three different routes with
Coates,'' said Buckley. ``And they had already run two of them.
Logic would tell you that they have only one left _ and that's the
one I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley stepped inside of Coates, Bledsoe apparently did not see
the cornerback, and the Dolphins had one of their five killer
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I study the tape and I know my ability versus his,'' Buckley
said. ``Mine is quickness. I'm not going to try and outmuscle
Coates; a guy my size, that's a loss for me. So just knowing what
you can do against your opponent is big, and that helped me on that
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Patriots mystery is why clutch wide receiver Shawn
Jefferson is on the sideline in a key passing situation and Vincent
Brisby is on the field. Even more of a mystery is why the page
outlining a short post pattern over the middle apparently is
missing from the New England playbook. But to opponents, the
mysteries are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bledsoe has such a great arm,'' said Dolphins linebacker Zach
Thomas. ``And he's so big and he sits in there in the pocket and
when we blitz, it puts us man-to-man and it puts a lot of pressure
on our corners. And he hangs in there and that's when he usually
hits his big play and hits teams big, when he doesn't have any
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the linebacker went on, ``We had pressure against Bledsoe
and that was huge. He had to get rid of it quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas can be very analytical. All defensive linemen and
linebackers, and all of their coaches, will say that pressuring an
NFL quarterback is the key to stopping a passing game. But Thomas
went deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the Patriots' quarterback quickly is even more
important, he said, because some of the New England pass routes
take time to develop. A long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think the receivers were getting through their
routes before Bledsoe could even get rid of the ball or the
pressure was on him,'' said Thomas. ``It has nothing to do with
Drew but has to do with a lot of things around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew is one of the best quarterbacks in the league, but Drew
can't get rid of the ball until a certain route comes through. And
I don't think they even got through their routes before he could
even get rid of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Patriots mystery is why linebacker Tedy Bruschi at times
trots off the field when the opponent has third and long. Bruschi's
strength since he arrived in New England has been precisely on that
down. But to Patriots opponents, the mysteries are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We studied the tape of them better this time than the first
game,'' said Miami defensive lineman Jason Taylor. ``I didn't take
advantage of the individual matchups and some of the things that
were there the last time but we all did a better job this time. I
know I did, personally. We studied these guys more this time and we
sort of knew some of the things they were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Taylor picked off a Bledsoe screen pass in the fourth
quarter, he said, he had been yelling to his teammates before the
play, ``Watch the screen! Watch the screen!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were ready for that,'' said Taylor. ``When I
went up for the ball, I saw Trace (Armstrong, defensive lineman)
running right behind me.''

 &HT;    Digital Insight buys rival company in $439 million dealBy Mark
Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A southern California company is buying a rival,
Norcross, Ga.-based nFront, for $439 million in stock. The
acquisition would create a powerful company in its segment of the
market: companies selling products and services for community banks
that want to reach their customers through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   John Dorman, Digital Insight's president and chief executive
will be chief executive and chairman of the new company. Tripp
Rackley, nFront's 29-year-old chairman and chief executive, will be
president. Digital Insight's seven member board of directors will
include two members from nFront, Rackley and a director to be named
later.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight, based in Calabasas, Calif., will exchange .579
shares for each nFront share. The deal values nFront shares at
$29.02, a 190 percent increase over nFront's June initial public
stock sale. nFront shares closed Monday at $21.25, up $2.50, or 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight shares were first offered to the public Oct. 1
at $14. Its shares have jumped 228 percent since, closing at $41.75
Monday, down 17 percent, or $8.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of a trend toward consolidation in the emerging
online banking industry. This month, Atlanta-based S1, formerly
Security First Technologies, closed on its acquisitions of FICS and
Edify. That company is expected to dominate the high-end of the
banking industry. Digital Insight and nFront focus on banks with
assets less than $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions pay companies such as nFront, Digital
Insight and S1 to set them up online. NFront products allow bank
customers to manage their accounts through Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people still bank the old-fashioned way, with direct
deposit, hand-written checks and mailed monthly statements. The
combined companies would have contracts with banks with a potential
16 million customers. Of those, 4 percent, or 640,000, manage their
money through their bank's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage says a lot about how young the online banking
market is, said Rob D. Owens, an analyst with Pacific Crest
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot also about the impact of the year 2000 issue,''
Owens said. ``You'll see banks step up their marketing efforts for
Internet banking.''
</P>
<P>
   nFront's Atlanta-area offices will stay open, the 150-person
staff remaining mostly in tact, said Jeff Hodges, nFront chief
financial officer. Hodges will be vice president of strategic
development for Digital Insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think scale and size matter,'' Hodges said. ``It's a land
grab and we're right at the foothill of mass adoption of Internet
banking.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company's 645 client banks will make it the largest
seller of online banking products to local banks. The new company
would have about 290 employees and $30 million in yearly sales.
Combined, the companies lost $4.8 million on revenue of $7.2
million for the three months that ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight expects to lose money at least through 2001,
according to a September filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The company said Monday the acquisition might move that
date up three months.

NEW ERGONOMICS RULES CONCERN SAFETY ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   While manufacturers described the nation's new ergonomics
standard as unfair Monday, workplace safety advocates said they
were concerned about language that could limit its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Tolle Graham, an occupational health specialist at the
Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, said
the measure is weakened by a provision in the regulation stating
that implementation of the standard will be triggered by an injury
in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   `This is not a program that will evaluate signs and symptoms
with the idea of preventing an injury from occurring,'' said
Graham. ``It isn't preventative enough . . . At the same time, it
is hopeful that we have gotten this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Krese, director of employment policy at the
Washington-based association, said she was leery of a clause in the
standard that promises to grandfather in companies that already
have appropriate safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members have received no assurances that this regulation
will improve worker safety,'' said Krese, who called the agency's
push to develop the standard ``disingenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's new
ergonomics standard, which will be implemented by the end of the
year 2000, employers at 1.6 million worksites will be required to
develop or implement a basic ergonomics program.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA estimates accommodations to a single work station will cost
$150 per year. The overall cost to employers will be approximately
$4.2 billion, and will include the $875 million US companies spend
on injured employees who are not fully covered by workers'
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the standard can be implemented, a series of hearings
must be held during which time workers and employers will testify
for or against the measure.

 &HT;    ``BOUNTY'' PROGRAM CUTS 40,000 CONVICTS OFF WELFARE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _More than 40,000 prisoners have been cut off the
public welfare rolls, thanks to a new system that pays a bounty to
states that report them to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The new system has helped the Social Security Administration to
discover $32 million in past payments to ineligible inmates. By
stopping the benefits, the government will save an estimated $38
million more, said a report issued Monday by the General Accounting
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program started two years ago, the federal government
pays states and localities
</P>
<P>
   up to $400 for reporting each ineligible recipient in their
prisons. That totalled $10 million nationwide from March 1997
through November 1998, said the GAO, which serves as the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives have been most successful in California, Florida,
Louisiana, New York, Ohio and Texas. Together, these half-dozen
states accounted for almost half of the inmates removed from
welfare roles.
</P>
<P>
   For their efforts, California received $1.69 million in
``bounty'' money, Florida $520,000, and Louisiana $626,200, New
York $1.1 million. Ohio reaped $492,000, and Texas got $591,000
over the period of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The program is part of the broader welfare reform legislation
passed by Congress in 1996. Before the new law, inmates frequently
got a variety of federal payments, including those reserved for the
aged, blind or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates who spend a full year in prison are barred from such
benefits. Until the law was changed, it was largely left to the
prisoners to declare themselves ineligible. Although some prisons
relayed information to federal authorities, there was no systematic
check.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, greeted the
results of the study as ``great news for taxpayers and horrible
news for convicts who were illegally getting welfare and Social
Security checks in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Archer added, ``If you're doing time, you don't get a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other states, Georgia received $182,600 in bounty money,
North Carolina $90,200 and Colorado $68,200 .

PRE-2K THANKSGIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is going to be our pre-millennial Thanksgiving, and we have
lots to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   While we continue to respect the perils of Y2K, not to mention
the myriad technological developments capable of wiping out the
planet, this week we prefer to dwell on the fact that Nostradamus'
prediction for 1999 turned out to be over-pessimistic. A King of
Terror did not emerge from the sky in July to create a war with the
Chinese, and we are extremely grateful. Although we were a little
nervous when America accidentally bombed that Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
   We are furthermore thankful that Edgar Cayce, ``the sleeping
prophet,'' was mistaken about California sliding into the sea and
the disappearance of Japan. Additionally, we are relieved that a
mysterious rainbow did not appear on Aug. 18 to suck all the oxygen
out of the atmosphere, as Criswell forecast in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Besides celebrating disasters averted, this is an excellent
Thanksgiving to contemplate millennial blessings, big and small.
Like eyeglasses. Our myopic ancestors were doomed to spend their
lives bumping into things, waiting for spectacles to be invented in
the 13th century. Europeans in A.D. 1000 also had neither zippers
nor buttons. They had to grope their way toward the Renaissance,
flapping in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   And forks. Forks were not only absent from holiday dinner tables
in Europe, they were regarded as a moral threat. When a
turn-of-the-millennium Venetian doge married a Byzantine princess,
her new neighbors were scandalized that she refused to eat with her
hands. ``She would impale (food) on a certain gold instrument with
two prongs and thus carry it to her mouth,'' complained St. Peter
Damian, a local critic. When the princess died of the plague, Peter
blamed the forks. You can read about it in his essay ``Of the
Venetian Doge's Wife, Whose Body After Her Excessive Delicacy
Entirely Rotted Away.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if your ancestors lived in Constantinople, they
already had access to a full set of cutlery. And if they came from
the Far East, the fork issue never came up. This millennium
business requires a lot of qualifications if you take a planet-wide
view.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you're eating this Thanksgiving, be grateful that it
was not what people dined on in Europe 1,000 years ago, when the
menu was pretty much limited to variations on the theme of greasy
meat. (A book of the period simply instructed the chef to ``boil
the things that need boiling and roast the things that need
roasting.'') People had salt, but pepper was so scarce it was
sometimes used as money. Forget marjoram. Forget the salad. Lettuce
was almost as dangerous as forks. One letter-writer of the era
warned that consumption of greens ``generates a humor which
putrefies the body and brings it to extremes of sickness and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   We are, by the way, also grateful to be living in an era where
there is not all that much talk of putrefaction.
</P>
<P>
   Tearing through a hunk of boiled mammal with your fingers was,
of course, the optimal culinary experience in Europe circa 1000.
Peasants were gumming their way through a hunk of rye bread in good
times, and boiling up a pot of straw soup in bad.
</P>
<P>
   But _ here's another planetary qualification _ in the Muslim
empire, which stretched all the way to Spain, people were into
gourmet cooking, whipping up spiced lamb sausages, chicken balls
and pickled fish. In China, the Sung emperor had 1,069 cooks in the
palace kitchen. The Chinese also had toothpaste, while people in
Europe barely had teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar that says next January starts us on a new
1,000-year cycle was created by the Western Europeans _ the guys
with the stale rye bread and no pepper. But all the world uses it
now, at least for commercial purposes. And although we really have
no common millennial history, all the world shares an impulse to
examine the past.
</P>
<P>
   Employers say they have a terrible time finding staff to work
Thanksgiving because it's the one holiday that everybody,
regardless of race, religion or nationality, likes. People who have
never heard of the Pilgrims still get the principle _ a big meal,
family and friends, counting blessings. The turn of the millennium
ought to be the same. A cultural milestone for some, but a moment
when everybody gets the point. Look back, in amazement, and see the
path we've walked.

OFFICIALS WONDER WHY BOY WASN'T HELPED BEFORE KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Nathaniel Abraham, the youngest American
charged and convicted of murder as an adult, received no special
counseling or other assistance despite warning signs years before
he fatally shot a man at age 11.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the crime and a week after his conviction, child
welfare officials are still unable to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel appeared in police reports as a possible suspect in
several crimes, including burglaries and larcenies, in the nearly
three years before he killed a man, Ronnie Greene Jr., with a
single shot to the head.
</P>
<P>
   But no charges were filed and Nathaniel, who is now 13, never
ended up in juvenile court or in any of the local counseling
programs, county officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel also fit the profile of a child at risk of getting in
trouble, county officials said. He was one of four children of a
single mother struggling to make ends meet. School officials had
diagnosed Nathaniel at the age of 8 as having below-average
intelligence and difficulty controlling his emotions. While he had
attended remedial education classes, he had received no special
counseling for his behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland County officials in this blue-collar city 25 miles
northwest of Detroit have acknowledged that their system of
juvenile justice and social services failed Nathaniel, and that
they do not know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, Nathaniel never got into the system,''
said David Gorcyca, Oakland County prosecutor. ``It's unfortunate
because we probably could have intervened earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nathaniel's lawyers are trying to have the boy's
second-degree murder conviction overturned, a preliminary hearing
on sentencing has been scheduled for Dec. 14. The Oakland County
Circuit Court judge, Eugene A. Moore, could sentence Nathaniel to
life in prison. But prosecutors have said they will ask that
Nathaniel be sent to a juvenile detention center and re-evaluated
by the judge at ages 19 and 21 to determine whether he should serve
time in an adult prison.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel's mother, Gloria Abraham, returned to school in her
mid-20s and then found a job as a medical laboratory technician on
a night shift while raising her four children and caring for a
mentally disabled sister.
</P>
<P>
   When Nathaniel began getting in trouble after school, while Ms.
Abraham was at work, she asked the police and the juvenile courts
to intervene, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   County officials have been blaming each other. Gorcyca said he
thought the police should have acted sooner. But Conway Thompson,
Pontiac's deputy chief of police, said officers had twice notified
Gorcyca's office that something needed to be done about Nathaniel.
On two other occasions, Thompson said, the police had urged
juvenile court officials to immediately put Nathaniel into its
counseling program, Youth Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Gorcyca said the prosecutor's office had not received any
referrals from the police about Nathaniel. Robert L. Bingham, the
family division administrator for the Oakland County Circuit Court,
said confidentiality rules prevented him from discussing individual
cases, but the court has been able to honor requests for counseling
under its Youth Assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nathaniel never received any counseling, said his lawyer,
Geoffrey Fieger.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel's age may have made it easier for him to fall between
the cracks. Thompson said that while someone like Nathaniel might
be mentioned in many police reports as a possible suspect, it was
often hard to find enough evidence or witnesses to justify bringing
charges. Some of the nearly two dozen police reports mentioning
Nathaniel only said that witnesses had blamed a boy named ``Nate.''
The police never determined whether this meant Nathaniel Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decided in 1967 that youths have many of the
same rights as adults to a lawyer and due process, in addition to
various other protections afforded to juveniles. This has made it
harder for police and prosecutors to pursue juvenile cases, county
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Called into the police station once to recover Nathaniel, Ms.
Abraham asked the police to hold him to teach him a lesson, only to
be told that such a request could be considered child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham became estranged from the father of her first three
children when she was 24. She moved in with her neighbors, Tommy
and Claudine Williams, two weeks after Nathaniel was born. The
Williamses, who had no children at home, raised Nathaniel after Ms.
Abraham moved into her own place nearby three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel thrived, Tommy Williams said. ``He was no problem when
he was growing up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abraham had a fourth child and then moved into a larger
house on the other side of town when Nathaniel was 8. Nathaniel
insisted on moving in with his family, Ms. Abraham told the Detroit
Free Press earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Nathaniel had trouble adjusting from life as an only child
to life as one of four children. He had trouble sharing, and his
name began appearing in police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel has been confined at a juvenile detention center
during the two years since his arrest. The center, Children's
Village, normally holds children awaiting immediate trial.
</P>
<P>
   County officials have defended Nathaniel's prolonged detention,
pointing out that numerous appeals by the defense and prosecution
had delayed the trial, which began on Oct. 29, two years to the day
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting counseling and he is getting an education, it's
not like he's over there rotting,'' said Gorcyca, while
acknowledging that, ``more intensive counseling could be available
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fieger, who is handling Nathaniel's case for free,
disagreed. Fieger, who ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic
candidate for governor last year, said that Nathaniel had received
no significant counseling at Children's Village. ``Michigan probate
court and the juvenile justice system is a hellhole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger has presented many of his criticisms of Nathaniel's
treatment by condemning budget cuts in Michigan's mental health and
juvenile justice system. Like many states, Michigan has been
eliminating mental health programs for juveniles, particularly
programs that allow youths to be treated at special homes. Until
the mid-1990s, Michigan had one of the nation's most renowned
systems for juvenile mental health, featuring seven residential
institutions. One of the institutions, Fairlawn Center, was in
Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has closed Fairlawn and five of the other six
centers as part of a shift toward treating more youths at less
expensive nonresidential clinics. Overall state spending on mental
health has almost doubled in the last decade, even as spending for
residential hospitals has been cut in half, said Geralyn Lasher, a
spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Community Health.
</P>
<P>
   Experts disagree over whether Nathaniel might have benefited
from a program like Fairlawn's.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Earl, the president of Oakland Family Services, a
nonprofit group here, said the state's mental health centers have
always been reserved for people with psychiatric disorders, not
character disorders. Nathaniel's below-average intelligence and
difficulties with anger represent ``sort of a maturity factor _
that's not necessarily a psychiatric disorder,'' Earl said, adding
that, ``the character disorders tend to end up in prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosemary Sarri, a University of Michigan professor of social
work specializing in juvenile justice, said Fairlawn might have
helped Nathaniel. She said that before most of the mental health
centers closed, she had worked in one of them with children whose
problems closely resembled Nathaniel's.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said they hope there was no one else with
problems like Nathaniel's who was not getting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of mental health groups suspect that Nathaniel's
plight is unusual only in that it ended in a slaying and a blaze of
national publicity. ``I don't know how many Nathaniels are out
there,'' Earl said. ``There are potential Nathaniels in every
neighborhood.''

   WASHINGTON _ When lawyers for fruit-producing countries in the
Caribbean wanted to watch legal arguments in a global trade dispute
over bananas, the World Trade Organization refused to let them in
the room.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But if the United States government has its way, the member
countries of the WTO will agree in Seattle to take some steps
toward opening its proceedings to greater public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO has been treated for too long like some private
priesthood for experts, where we know what's right and we pat you
on the head and tell you to just go right along and play by the
rules that we reach,'' President Clinton said in a speech last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want the world trading system to have legitimacy, we
have got to allow every legitimate group with any kind of beef,
whether they're right or wrong, to have some access to the
deliberative process of the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of openness _ known as transparency in the parlance of
trade negotiators _ is the one issue on which the Clinton
administration, the U.S. business community and WTO critics from
the labor, environmental and consumer movements are in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy says opening up
the WTO will be one of the United States' top priorities in the
round of negotiations that begins in Seattle. She said a lack of
openness at the International Monetary Fund has threatened
congressional support for that organization, and that the WTO runs
the same risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO is somewhat more open than people perceive, but not
nearly open enough from the point of view of the U.S.'' Barshefsky
said in an interview. ``We push on ahead for notions of greater
transparency, greater accountability, greater citizen participation
and input.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, was even more secretive, and that the WTO is
somewhat hampered by ``bureaucratic inertia.'' But she said many
countries, including European countries with a tradition of open
government, are resisting change at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many member countries do not have the kinds of traditions of
openness and political accountability that we do, and so they are
not comfortable with the notion of greater transparency,
particularly when their own government regimes may not be
particularly transparent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even countries in Europe have difficulty ... in accepting
broader notions of transparency in these institutions, and I've
never heard a satisfactory explanations from European member states
as to why that is so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pledged to push in Seattle to
open the WTO's dispute resolution procedures to the public, to
allow non-governmental organizations to file amicus curiae (friend
of the court) briefs in cases involving the environment, and to
create formal mechanisms tose the involvement of
non-governmental organizations with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. trade official said the administration is hopeful that
the WTO might in Seattle agree to improve public access to
documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, who asked not to be named, said it is proving
much more difficult to persuade WTO members of the benefits of
opening committee meetings, or of requiring dispute panels to read
amicus briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also is pushing to open up procurement from
other nations to competitive bidding. But this step is somewhat
controversial. The U.S. government says the step will reduce the
opportunity for corruption, bribery and insider deals. But some
consumer groups, such as Public Citizen, worry that it would
prevent countries from such steps as reaching out to minority and
women contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups, on the other hand, want the United
States to take some internal steps to open up the U.S. trade
negotiating arena. Environmentalists recently won a lawsuit arguing
that they should be represented on certain federal trade advisory
panels, and they argue that their absence from panels on issues
like forestry are indicative of the U.S. trade representative's
advocacy for business interests rather than for labor and
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade bodies have developed to help industry _ that's their
history and that's how U.S. officials viewed them,'' said Patti
Goldman, managing attorney for the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund
in Seattle. ``They don't build solutions for environmental problems
in the WTO, they look for trade barriers and try to get rid of
them. It's been a slow education process even for the U.S. trade
representative's office to see that there are other values.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO is becoming somewhat more open to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Panel decisons are released to the public, but slowly.
Governments may release their own legal submissions, but not those
of other countries. The WTO's web site (www.wto.org) contains some
documents, but not all. And the speechmaking sessions of the WTO in
Seattle next will be webcast, although the negotiating sessions and
committee meetings will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO's conduct is in sharp contrast to the U.S. government,
which as a result of a tradition of participatory democracy and a
network of laws is required to grant the public access to watch its
proceedings, offer comment on proposed laws, and read most
government documents.
</P>
<P>
   WTO dispute panels are considerably less open to public scrutiny
than is the U.S. judicial system, in which legal filings are
generally available to the public, hearings are generally open, and
outside groups can, with the consent of the judge, offer
submissions called amicus briefs in which they comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency is a pervasive, daily problem with the WTO,''
said Thea Lee, a top trade policy adviser with the AFL-CIO. The
labor union, concerned that the WTO dispute settlement panel did
not include anyone with expertise on worker health, wanted to weigh
in on a dispute between Canada and France over whether France
should be allowed to ban asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFL-CIO did submit a brief, but we never received an
acknowledgment, and it's not clear that they have any obligation to
read it or accept our input,'' Lee said.

`EXECUTION OF JUSTICE' AND X-FILES REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  2.5 and 3 stars  
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor George Moscone was obviously better-known
than Harvey Milk, a city supervisor, when the two were gunned down
21 years ago by troubled Twinkie-ingestor Dan White. In the
intervening years, Milk has eclipsed his boss in our collective
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, of course, was an impassioned gay-rights activist, the
first openly gay politician elected to public office in America,
and his murder became an ipso facto martyrdom, depicted in the
Oscar-winning documentary ``The Times of Harvey Milk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, both Oliver Stone and Robin Williams have expressed
interest in filming Milk's story, versions that would have been
variously more overheated and sappier than ``Execution of
Justice.'' This Showtime film provocatively approaches the story
from the killer's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a play by Emily Mann, ``Execution of Justice'' is a
film of many strengths, and just one of them is that it doesn't
condescendingly deify Milk. In fact, he's merely a supporting
character in White's drama, and his matter-of-fact homosexuality
may be irksome to White, but nothing he can't cope with.
</P>
<P>
   You shudder to think how Williams, in his current mode of
reducing everything to cinematic treacle, would have played the
guy.) Peter Coyote essays Milk as smart, compassionate and a little
playful, and refuses to romanticize his subject.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Execution,'' in ersatz documentary fashion, posits
White as the original disenfranchised conservative white guy,
bewildered and rankled that he no longer rules the roost, long
before such a role became a cultural cliche. When White, a former
cop and fireman, joined the same city board of supervisors as Milk,
and found himself jobbed on all sides _ by his constituents, by the
developers who railroaded him and by his peers _ his frustrations
burbled, Vesuvius-like, until he resigned in spite. He finally
flipped out when, after taking his ball and going home, Moscone
refused to allow him back into the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   The film, as well as a short documentary following it titled
``Witnesses to the Execution,'' points out that White's murdering
Milk was more an act of psychotic politics than homophobia. The
true homophobia was manifested when White's jury, stupefyingly,
bought the defense argument that junk food had thrust him into a
period of temporary insanity and found him guilty of mere
manslaughter rather than premeditated murder. The riots that
resulted protesting the shoddy handling of Milk's memory in
particular (and Moscone's, somewhat secondarily) ensured Milk's
enduring stature in gay-rights history. White, tormented after his
release from prison eight years later, eventually committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Daly takes on a daunting challenge _ explicating an unfathomable
point of view _ and humanizes White's deranged befuddlement. Almost
perpetually in a drab, styleless brown suit, Daly's White is a guy
who yearns to do good but has no wherewithal or backbone to do so
in the shark-infested political waters he tentatively wades into.
At times, when things don't go his way, Daly seems to be channeling
the precise petulance Dan Quayle displayed in the 1988 vice
presidential debates, as White uses his staid value system as a
smoke screen to attack lifestyles he doesn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution of Justice'' is marred by director Leon Ichaso's
occasional strident efforts to gravely pound home the importance of
his film. The heavenly choirs on the soundtrack are overkill, for
example, and using a drag queen as a preachy Greek chorus doesn't
serve the material particularly well, either. At other times,
there's a certain dramatic inertia, as the film rushes to cram in
all the pertinent, if not necessarily interesting, facts.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Execution of Justice'' is buoyed by Daly's complex,
layered performance, and Coyote's solid but more casual turn, and
by vividly capturing the righteous mayhem that fueled San Francisco
in its moment of crisis. Its powerful story is not just about gay
rights but about how a city was dragged, sometimes against its
will, into a state of greater understanding and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   A kiss is just a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``X-Files'' episode indeed gives rabid fans what
they've long wished for _ Mulder and Scully smooch _ but be warned:
It's far more interested in trying to wrap up all the messy plot
strands left behind by ``Millennium,'' the Chris Carter series that
was canceled last season. Lance Henriksen appears as Frank Black,
the disgruntled former member of the Millennium Group _ heck, Frank
was disgruntled about pretty much everything _ who has checked
himself into a psychiatric hospital in an effort to lighten up when
Mulder and Scully approach him about their latest bizarre case.
</P>
<P>
   Seems someone's digging up and resurrecting the bodies of dead
Millennium Group zealots, creating an ersatz Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse and hoping to bring on Armageddon before the year 2000.
``Millennium'' was dumped because of viewer apathy, so it seems a
dubious choice to force Mulder and Scully to spend Dec. 31 mopping
up Frank Black's dirty work _ really, who cares? _ instead of
battling a more original Y2K peril more germane to their harsh
realm. Still, it's a serviceable episode, albeit predictable vis a
vis the circumstances surrounding their clinch, which, like
everything ``X''-related, lingers ambiguously.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, these two almost kissed in the movie 18 months
ago, and if they really had been hot for one another, they probably
would have found an opportunity to pick up where they left off
before now. So let's leave these cold fish to themselves and go
find another TV couple with an initially chilly chemistry that's
just waiting to erupt in passion _ Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson,
anyone?

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANO, Nigeria _ After Friday prayers, townsfolk say, Maryam
Abacha, the widow of the dictator who ruled and looted this country
for five years, has begun opening the gates of the family compound
to the city's poor, who fill her courtyard to receive free bags of
rice, millet and sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is regarded here as a crude attempt to burnish the
image of the Abachas, who have become the poster family of an
unexpected and ambitious drive by the county's new president,
Olusegun Obasanjo, to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over in May as the first civilian president in
nearly 16 years, Obasanjo has extended his probe into nearly all
levels of society that benefited from the military rule that made
Nigeria one of the world's most corrupt countries.
</P>
<P>
   The government has seized properties belonging to retired
military officials, senior civil servants are being investigated
for fraud and high-ranking officers, forced to retire by Obasanjo,
are now on trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Abacha family home is surrounded by heavily armed soldiers
and his widow remains a virtual prisoner inside, rarely venturing
into the city her family long controlled with unchallenged
authority. A Swiss court, at Nigeria's request, has frozen the
family's accounts, which may total more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the government has yet to undertake the serious
reforms needed to wipe out corruption in a country whose vast oil
reserves draw in billions of loosely controlled dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics say some of the Obasanjo government's own
practices, particularly its dealings with Parliament, are
themselves shady and undermine its cleanup effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most acknowledge that Obasanjo _ a former general
whose election campaign was bankrolled by military leaders and who
many doubted would probe the past _ has far surpassed expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when Obasanjo first served as president, his
government was known to have skimmed money from the country's oil
exports, which were much in demand during the oil crises of the
period. Also, government officials were known to expect payments
for import licenses and government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the current examination is expected to cover
government activities going back to 1966, when the military first
took over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many people expected a quarter of what Obasanjo has
done in terms of his anti-corruption stance,'' said Tunde Oni,
projects manager for Integrity, a group based in Lagos, the former
capital, that tracks corruption and is financed by American
sources. ``Those affected most are the big military and political
elite who have controlled our country for many years. They have
much to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Femi Ajayi, a banker who like many of his colleagues was
arbitrarily imprisoned for four years by the former military ruler,
Gen. Sani Abacha, when the military systematically purchased stakes
in the country's biggest banks, said that military officials now
controlled most Nigerian banks. Obasanjo will succeed in fighting
corruption, Ajayi said, ``but he will have a very difficult time
because the people he is going after have enormous resources that
they will use against him.''
</P>
<P>
   While such steps are not risk-free in a country that has known
military coups, the Obasanjo government's efforts are aimed at
recovering what could amount to billions of dollars needed to
rebuild almost every layer of Nigerian society after years of
misrule.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive cleanup at home could buttress Obasanjo's
requests for Western governments, including Washington, to trace
Nigeria's stolen money overseas and for Nigeria to be rewarded with
what he has called a ``democracy dividend.'' That would include
forgiveness of at least some of the $30 billion owed by a
government whose reserves were depleted during military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has succeeded so far without facing a serious revolt
from his powerful enemies, analysts said, partly because his
anti-corruption campaign has been the one issue that has received
strong support throughout this ethnically and religiously divided
country.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he began his crackdown on corruption immediately
after taking office, using his unique position in Nigeria to do so.
As the man who served as the country's military ruler in the 1970s
and was later imprisoned for three years by Abacha in the 1990s,
Obasanjo is both an insider and outsider, said Pat Utomi, an
economist at the Lagos Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the man juxtaposed by the events of history to play
this role right now,'' Utomi said. ``And so he's governing
fearlessly, almost as if he has a death wish. Why? He's 61 years
old. He's been president, he's been jailed. He has money. He has
achieved everything. This is what's left.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has also strengthened his hold over the military by
forcing about 150 senior officers who had held political
appointments since 1985 to retire abruptly. Most of those being
tried or investigated are from that group.
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking openly of a potential military backlash
against Obasanjo, partly because his efforts have proven popular
and the military remains extremely unpopular after nearly 16 years
of disastrous rule. But in a country where generals have led for
all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960, and where
nine successful or failed coups have taken place, the possibility
of revolt remains real.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos and Abuja, the Obasanjo government confiscated plots of
land that the military government bought in 1997 and gave to 37
high-ranking military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lost their plots included some of the country's most
visible soldiers: Maj. Hamza Al-Mustapha, Abacha's former security
chief who was one of the most feared men in Nigeria, and is now on
trial on murder charges. Lt. Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, a former army
chief who is also being investigated in the killings of opposition
leaders; and Vice Adm. Mike Akhigbe, who was second to Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar in the transition government preceding
Obasanjo's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   In the same area in Lagos, construction has stopped on a Total
gas station that was being built by a company believed to belong to
Akhigbe. After local people complained that the station sat
dangerously alongside a highway, the Lagos state government agreed
that the project violated zoning laws and condemned it. Today, the
red X's painted on the station's walls have come to symbolize how
ordinary Nigerians and the rule of law succeeded in stopping the
will of someone who was the second most powerful man in the country
less than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking at the kind of people who are being
investigated, these are sacred cows,'' Utomi said. ``This is going
after big fish.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the targets in Obasanjo's campaign are being
unfairly persecuted. ``Our case is just a vendetta against us,''
said Abdulhadi Al-Mustapha, the younger brother of Abacha's former
security chief. ``I wonder why they are targeting only particular
people. Government is a collective regime. So whenever something
goes wrong in a regime, blame should go to the entire regime.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A wild-child earth mother pulls up stakes and moves her
precocious daughter across the country. The two fuss and feud,
switch familial roles and, after enduring some hard times and
rotten men, they eventually strike a truce and form a mutual
appreciation society.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It should to anyone who saw ``Anywhere but
Here,'' Wayne Wang's well-intentioned road picture, earlier this
month. That movie, starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman,
smoothed out the rough edges of Mona Simpson's searing novel to
such a degree that the finished product barely registered. It would
be hard for a film to be any less involving.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with the similarly themed ``Tumbleweeds,''
which takes the same premise and has the courage to run with it.
While the film doesn't stake out any territory that hasn't already
been visited by, say, ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' it does
have a bawdy sense of humor, candid honesty and terrific
performances in the lead roles. And that's enough to make you want
to take a trip with this mother-daughter team.
</P>
<P>
   Well-regarded British stage actress Janet McTeer plays Mary Jo
Walker, a Southern firecracker who tends to fall for, and quite
often marry, whatever man crosses her line of vision. The film's
opening moments find Mary Jo and her 12-year-old daughter, Ava
(Kimberly Brown), fleeing from the latest catastrophe and hitting
the road, destination unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo is on the constant lookout for Prince Charming; her self
worth is tied to her dating status. Ava has learned from her manic
mom's mistakes and isn't afraid to question her when poor judgment
is exercised _ which is often the case.
</P>
<P>
   The two relocate to Starlight Beach, a fictional coastal town
north of San Diego. Ava makes friends, finds a calling in her
school's production of ``Romeo and Juliet'' and attracts the
interest of a loopy classmate, Adam (Cody McMains), whose hairstyle
becomes more unlikely each time we seem him.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo, meanwhile, takes up with a trucker, Dan (the film's
director and co-writer, Gavin O'Connor), who she met on the road.
Mary Jo believes that this time she might have found the stability
she has long craved, but it's apparent (to the audience, at least)
that history has a way of repeating itself and that Mary Jo needs
to learn a lesson or two before she can move on.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer, displaying an expert ability to affect a North Carolina
accent, oozes brassy charm and hits every right
</P>
<P>
   note in her demanding role. It's an electrifying turn. Brown,
best-known for her work on the soap opera ``Guiding Light,'' is
equally good, imbuing her bright 12-year-old with an assured
authenticity that never lapses into cutie-pie antics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the credit for that should go to the charming and
touching screenplay, written by O'Connor and his ex-wife, Angela
Shelton. O'Connor, who cast himself apparently as a cost-cutting
measure, shows a sure hand in the director's chair, making
``Tumbleweeds'' a kind of intimate family snapshot that we're lucky
enough to glimpse.

 KANO, Nigeria: entire regime.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Various investigations have also found corruption at all levels
of military and government power, in appointments, allocations of
licenses, contracts and purchases, said Christopher Kolade, the
chairman of one of several government panels looking into past
military rule and a former chief executive of Cadbury's operations
in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale of corruption we have found is sometimes
astonishing,'' said Kolade, sitting in a hotel suite in the
capital, Abuja, with piles of documents waiting to be inspected
stacked against a wall behind him. ``On the whole, though, we knew
what we might encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Kolade's biggest discoveries was the secret award of
lucrative off-shore oil exploration contracts to companies linked
to military officials. The Obasanjo government canceled the
contracts, and the president said this week that new guidelines for
a fresh selection would be announced soon.
</P>

   Beyond those headline-grabbing findings, Kolade said what was
harder to quantify was a culture of corruption that permeated all
levels of Nigerian society, from a police officer who squeezes 10
cents out a taxi driver to a bureaucrat who grants a permit in
return for $100 bribe. The crackdown at the top appears to have
trickled down to the street, as soldiers have returned to the
barracks and police officers have grown more hesitant in openly
demanding bribes.

   In the northern city of Kaduna, a judicial commission is
examining the workings of a fertilizer plant that many believe
represents a typical, mundane case of corrupt practices.

<P>
   A former director of the plant, Dalandi Kifasi, is accused of
giving free fertilizer bags to officials in the federal ministry of
agriculture and other powerful figures under the Abacha regime,
including 600 bags worth $6,000 to a foundation created by
Al-Mustapha, Abacha's former security chief. What's more, Kifasi is
being investigated for ordering four all-wheel-drive trucks for his
plant and giving them to agriculture officials.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview inside his house in Kaduna, Kifasi defended his
actions, saying that the vehicles had been seized by the officials
without his knowledge. As for the fertilizer bags, Kifasi argued it
was common practice to thank those who had helped a business with a

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Intimidation by militias linked to the
Indonesian military is preventing tens of thousands of East
Timorese refugees from returning home from camps in West Timor, a
senior American diplomat said Monday on a tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. representative at the United
Nations, which took over the civilian administration of East Timor
after the territory voted for independence from Indonesia, said in
a telephone interview that international relief experts were losing
a crucial information battle to the roving pro-Jakarta gangs that
lost out in East Timor and are now operating freely in West Timor,
an Indonesian province.
</P>
<P>
   After the overwhelming vote for independence in August, the
militias waged a campaign of violence in East Timor, driving many
people into hiding or into seeking refuge across the border in West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militia are using two core tactics to prevent the refugees
from going home,'' Holbrooke said from Dili, the East Timorese
capital. ``One is physical intimidation, but the more serious one
is disinformation. They have told the people that there is still
fighting in East Timor, that Australian troops will rape the women
and that they can't go back because Xanana Gusmao will kill them or
take retribution.'' Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the East Timorese
independence leader, is widely known to Timorese by his pen name,
Xanana.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the office of the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees was ``not yet on top of the situation.'' He said he and
the U.N. administrator, Sergio Vieira de Mello, would ask Gusmao to
make a reassuring videotape on Tuesday to be shown to the refugees.
Monsignor Carlos Ximenes Belo, the Nobel Peace laureate who is a
spiritual leader of the East Timorese, will also be approached,
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke compared the militiamen, some of whom he saw wearing
Indonesian army T-shirts, to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who
terrorized Cambodian refugees in Thailand in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these camps to become permanent,'' Holbrooke
said of the settlements in West Timor. ``It is a truism of all
refugee camps that the longer people remain refugees, the less
likely they are to return. These people should go back immediately.
But they're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Holbrooke helped to arrange an agreement on border
security between Indonesian military commanders and the Australian
officer, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, who commands the international
peacekeeping force in East Timor. Matan Ruak, the deputy commander
of East Timor's former rebel army, Falantil, also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Kris Janowski, the spokesman for the high
commissioner for refugees, said the agency's staff members had been
assaulted and stoned trying to help refugees leave the camps. He
said officials, who have tried radio broadcasts to get information
to refugees, were forced to use ``hit and run'' techniques to get
them out of camps _ driving up and racing to load as many people as
possible into a vehicle before the militias intervene.
</P>
<P>
   About 90,000 East Timorese have returned home, leaving between
100,000 and 150,000 displaced people in West Timor, not all of whom
want to go back. The Indonesian government is being asked to
resettle those refugees elsewhere in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and other experts say the Indonesian military, stung
by the loss of East Timor, could turn West Timor, an undisputed
Indonesian province, into a festering crisis for Indonesia, the
United Nations and possibly Australia, which is leading the
peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
   A long conflict in West Timor could cost Indonesia the
international support that it needs at its most critical point, a
British expert on Southeast Asia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is a very, very sick country,'' Peter Carey of
Oxford University told an Asia Society audience in New York on
Monday. ``It needs to be in a process of intensive care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the country would have to be rebuilt with a kind of
Asian Marshall Plan _ a more comprehensive aid package than those
provided normally by the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Carey, a history professor and the author of numerous books
on the region, said outsiders would have to understand that the
situation could get worse in West Timor even as camps are emptied,
depriving the militias of important power bases. The Indonesian
army and its East Timorese supporters are in effect making their
last stand there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in West Timor is very insecure,'' he said, ``and
very insecure people will do very violent things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., used a
budget amendment to tie all future military sales and cooperation
with the Indonesian military to a list of demands that include the
return of the refugees to their homes and the prosecution of all
members of the armed forces who aided the attacks on East Timorese
since the August referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that late last week in Jakarta he told Indonesian
government leaders _ including President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is
known by a nickname, Gus Dur _ that ``Indonesia's international
standing is being clobbered by what was happening in the camps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The civilian leadership, from President Gus Dur on down _ and
particularly the attorney general and the defense minister _ all
wanted us to put public pressure on their own military to solve
this problem,'' said Holbrooke, who has been traveling with Stanley
Roth, assistant secretary of state for Asia and the Pacific, and
Robert Gelbard, the American ambassador to Indonesia. ``They did
not regard this as outside interference. They encouraged it. They
welcomed it. They asked us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesians are much more concerned about Aceh than about
West Timor,'' Holbrooke said, referring to the independence
movement in their troubled Aceh province. ``We told them we want to
get West Timor settled because we also are concerned in the long
term about Aceh and the rest of Indonesia.''

CHRISTIANS PROTEST BUILDING OF MOSQUE NEAR CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The doors of Christian shrines were closed
throughout the Holy Land Monday in protest against a decision by
Israel to permit construction of a mosque near the Church of the
Annunciation in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the mosque is due to be laid Tuesday in a
square at the foot of the church, on the site where Christians
believe the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would bear the
infant Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute that led to the two-day demonstration, which church
leaders say was the first time in memory that the doors were closed
at all 35 of the most sacred shrines, has heightened religious
tensions just one month before the Holy Land prepares to celebrate
2,000 years of the Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was but the latest reminder that as the millennium
approaches, the Holy Land is as entangled as ever in the conflicts
that have shaped its history, age-old disputes and rivalries that
some fear could diminish the coming celebrations and an expected
visit by the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   The tension and squabbling has surfaced in several places
besides Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem, where Jesus was born,
Christian leaders are worried that the streets remain clogged by
unfinished construction projects and torn-up roads barely a month
before Christmas. The Palestinian Authority seems to have allowed
poor planning, limited funding, and intercine political battles to
tarnish an historic opportunity for Palestinian Christians to show
the world their central shrine.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Israel, the chief rabbinate has warned that any hotel from
Jerusalem to Tel Aviv that displays a Christmas tree in its lobby
or holds a public celebration of New Year's Eve will lose its
``kashrut,'' or kosher, license, a penalty that could put a hotel
out of business in the Jewish state. Rabbi Yaakov Sabag, the head
of the rabbinate's ``kashrut'' section, said the warning was issued
because ``there are some Jews who find the Christmas tree
offensive; it is a symbol, a symbol like a swastika.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, where
Christian faith holds that Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose
again, the six denominations that share control of the shrine are
locked in the latest of a series of quarrels. This time the issue
is where to create a fire exit for the Crusader-era church, which
is expected to be packed with tourists in the coming year. Without
a second exit, Israeli authorities fear a ``tragedy in the making''
at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at the Holy Sepulchre, however, disappointed tourists
found the massive doors closed and locked.
</P>
<P>
   John Gorman, 64, a retired fireman from Queens, N.Y. and a
parishioner from Our Lady Queen of Martyrs traveling on a package
tour to the Holy Land, said, ``The doors should be open. We are
Christians here, and they shouldn't be punishing the Christian
tourists who come. I don't see the benefit in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Suther, 37, of Key Largo, Fla, stood with his wife and said
a silent prayer in front of the closed doors. He said he was
``disappointed'' not to be able to enter the shrine, but that he
understood and supported the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the church wanted to protest what Israel did in
Nazareth, which was to make a decision that has turned the Muslims
and Christians against each other,'' said Suther. ``If Israel
intended to do a policy of divide and conquer, I would say their
policy is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's Latin Patriarch Monsignor Michel Sabbah, said,
``This land was never a land without problems. Sadly, this is the
way of life here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbah added that closing the shrines _ a decision led by the
six largest denominations including Greek Orthodox and Roman
Catholic _ was an important and historic statement that needed to
be made.
</P>
<P>
   Although the controversy arose after a militant group of Moslems
began pushing to build the mosque in Nazareth, the Christian church
leaders are directing their protest at the Israeli government,
which they accuse of fostering divisions betwen the Muslim majority
and Christian minority in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the mosque have triggered sporadic violence over the
course of a two-year political battle that has been cast in
religious terms. The dispute erupted when Nazareth, which is headed
by a Christian mayor, said it wanted to use municipal land
adjoining the Church of the Annunciation for a public plaza to
accommodate millions of tourists expected to come to see the place
where Jesus lived much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some Moslems objected that one corner of the lot was the site of
a holy shrine to a Muslim martyr who fought against the Christian
Crusaders, and that the public plaza would desecrate the shrine. A
fringe group of Muslim hardliners from the Islamic Movement then
seized part of the land, erected a makeshift mosque, and blared
Mulsim calls to prayer on loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The municipality insisted that the land had been taken
unlawfully by the Muslims and urged Israeli authorities to evict
the Muslim group.
</P>
<P>
   But two months ago, the Israeli authorities granted permission
for the Muslims to build the new mosque. The Israelis described it
as a compromise that would allow the Muslims to build the mosque
and the municipality to build the plaza to accommodate tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben Ami, Israel's Minister of Internal Security, who took
part in the government's decision, said the Christian response was
``lamentable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never our intention to infringe upon the natural and
legitimate rights of the Christians in this country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the Christian churches see the Israeli decision as unusual
and historic intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closure of the church doors is a protest, to say that we
as Arab Christians exist. We have our dignity, and our right to be
respected, not only as Christians, but as human beings,'' explained
Sabbah, the Latin patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Timothy, a bishop of the Greek Orthodox Church,
said, ``We get along well with our Muslim neighbors. We have never
been against the building of a mosque. What we are against is this
specific site, which is a provocation by a very small group of
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbah and Timothy are leaders among the steadily diminishing
Christian population in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Israel. The
number of Arab Christians has fallen from nearly 20 percent of the
population in the early part of the century to less than 2 percent
today. At this rate, demographers predict that the indigenous
Christian community could virtually disappear within a generation
from the land where the faith began.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian community here regards the millennium celebration
as an unique opportunity to inform the world of its imperiled
existence and to point out the unique struggles it faces as a
minority religion often caught between the Jewish state and the
predominantly Muslim Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Kandalaft, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Christian affairs, played down the controversy.
``Everybody should be excited about the expectations for peace in
the Middle East as we enter the third millennium. That is the big
celebration. So any problems, any tensions in Nazareth, any work in
Bethlehem, any overcrowding in the Holy Sepulchre, that is going to
pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Holy Land prepares to receive millions of pilgrims
and what is expected to be an historic visit by the Pope in March,
it remains to be seen whether the recent problems and disputes are
merely the kind of tensions that surface within a family before a
big celebration, or something more profound.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is at stake _ not just billions of dollars in tourism but
perhaps something larger, the chance for the turning of the
calendar year 2000 to be an occasion for new enlightenment and
understanding in a land shared by three monotheistic faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, director of the Anti-Defamation League in
Jerusalem, acknowledged that there were points of tension around
the coming millennium, but he stressed that there is also a spirit
of interfaith dialogue. He noted that he was at a conference Monday
that brought together Christian and Muslim leaders of Nazareth at
the very moment that the church doors were closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a spirit that is moving ahead on interfaith
understanding,'' he said, ``even if many feel it is moving too
slowly.''

FLASHBACK, COURTESY OF THE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The further Al Gore tries to distance himself from
Bill Clinton, the more closely the Republicans want to link the two
of them. That is why the Republican National Committee is putting
up a billboard that shows the president and vice president in a
bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is planning to rotate a series of images at a site
across the street from Gore's presidential campaign headquarters in
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The first one shows Gore and Clinton embracing. Stamped across
the front is a reminder of Gore's tribute on the day last year that
the House voted for impeachment: that Clinton would go down in
history as one of the country's greatest presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to turn some heads,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of
the committee. ``It's a pretty stark reminder of his close
relationship with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said the picture would convey quickly and graphically
that Gore is deeply associated with the president, who enjoys
favorable job-approval ratings but, as Nicholson put it, ``is
disdained on a personal level, and that's rubbing off on Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also intended to remind viewers that Gore has undertaken a
head-spinning process of separating himself from the president
while trying to benefit from being part of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days he solidly embraces the president and some days he
doesn't,'' Nicholson said. ``Al Gore doesn't know who Al Gore is
and what he should be today: vice president or presidential
aspirant. He can't decide who he is and what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans expect to rent the billboard, which is to be in
place in the next two weeks, through March. Gore moved his campaign
headquarters last month from Washington to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   By renting the billboard, the Republicans are inadvertently
paying Gore the compliment that he will most likely be the
Democratic nominee, elevating him at this early stage to
general-election status as their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But first Gore faces a tough challenge from former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey. Some Republicans have said they believe that
Bradley would appeal to voters in both parties and to independents,
and would be a tougher opponent next November.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the billboard, Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore,
said: ``The billboard is telling in what it does not show, and that
is the Republican agenda, because there is none. Al Gore and the
campaign look forward to talking about the vice president's record
of success and his vision for the future, and comparing it with
what the Republicans are offering, which is no vision, no message,
no ideas.''

<P>
   ``Flawless'' isn't.
</P>
<P>
   A well-meaning and, in some respects, highly accomplished
tolerance melodrama, the movie is ultimately undone by unnecessary
plot distractions and, though they're interestingly detailed,
uninvolving characterizations. Terrific performances from the two
technically proficient leads and a diverse (to say the least)
supporting cast go a long way toward keeping the film engaging from
moment to moment. But they're not enough to make it amount to
something that it just fundamentally is not.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of that aspiration, one of the movie's subjects
describes himself as a woman trapped in a man's body. Cliched as
that sounds _ and it's far from the only cliche director Joel
Schumacher indulges in his original script _ Rusty the committed
transvestite is nonetheless brought to vivid, hyper-charged life by
Philip Seymour Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The pudgy actor, noted for the alarmingly damaged individuals
he's played with striking empathy in ``Happiness'' and ``Boogie
Nights,'' goes all-out bravura with Rusty's feminine mannerisms,
deep-dish neuroses and resilient compassion and courage. It's an
appropriately over-the-top performance with a lot undergirding it,
but memorable mostly because it's so big, not because the character
is unique.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro is in a similar situation. His Walt Koontz is
another resident of the Lower East Side tenement hotel where Rusty
lives, a heroic and very conservative retired security guard. He
hates the noisy drag queens who practice their show tunes in
Rusty's fabulously cluttered apartment. But when Walt is laid low
by a stroke, and his pride and physical infirmity prevent him from
traveling to therapy, he must choke down his pride and take singing
lessons from Rusty to regain control of his voice.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro seems dead-on perfect, as ever, playing the subtlest
tics and most devastating infirmities of a recovering stroke
victim. He also superbly adapts Walt's short-tempered, intolerant
personality into the needy mode, and plays the character's
inevitable warming up to his despised benefactor with determinedly
obnoxious difficulty. He even exposes Walt's (and the script's)
most saving grace _ the character's well-camouflaged vulnerability
after a lifetime of intimate betrayals _ with a resonant, stoic
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't help but think of him as this week's disease
person before you think of Walt as a fully formed individual.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hoffman makes Rusty as overly defensive and
snappish as he can be. For two polar opposites plot-forced to
accept and even become friends with one another, these guys make it
as hard, and by that as dramatically valid, as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that isn't the only drama on display here.
There's a thoroughly unnecessary thriller theme involving stolen
drug money that hijacks the climax to action movie territory
(admirably more personal as this project is for him, Schumacher
apparently couldn't bring himself to jettison the elements that
people went to his Batman and John Grisham movies for).
</P>
<P>
   We also get some idea of how New York's downscale drag community
operates, but only an idea. There's a Flawless beauty pageant that
we never see, arch encounters between flamboyant she-men and gay
Republicans, and haughty snapping and slapping between rival
transwhatevers. It all essentially reinforces stereotypes and
avoids specific insight _ and the same goes for the
heart-of-gold/stone/rock cocaine dichotomies set up among the
various hookers who populate the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``Flawless'' marks a positive step in Schumacher's
development, (though his last two films, ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' and the
repulsive ``8mm,'' arguably left nowhere to go but up). It's also
another impressive De Niro gimmick job and the most elaborate one
of those yet from the talented and ever-developing Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   All the good parts just don't add up, though, to what the film
and we wish it was.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``Flawless'' isn't.
</P>
<P>
   A well-meaning and, in some respects, highly accomplished
tolerance melodrama, the movie is ultimately undone by unnecessary
plot distractions and, though they're interestingly detailed,
uninvolving characterizations. Terrific performances from the two
technically proficient leads and a diverse (to say the least)
supporting cast go a long way toward keeping the film engaging from
moment to moment. But they're not enough to make it amount to
something that it just fundamentally is not.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of that aspiration, one of the movie's subjects
describes himself as a woman trapped in a man's body. Cliched as
that sounds _ and it's far from the only cliche director Joel
Schumacher indulges in his original script _ Rusty the committed
transvestite is nonetheless brought to vivid, hyper-charged life by
Philip Seymour Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The pudgy actor, noted for the alarmingly damaged individuals
he's played with striking empathy in ``Happiness'' and ``Boogie
Nights,'' goes all-out bravura with Rusty's feminine mannerisms,
deep-dish neuroses and resilient compassion and courage. It's an
appropriately over-the-top performance with a lot undergirding it,
but memorable mostly because it's so big, not because the character
is unique.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro is in a similar situation. His Walt Koontz is
another resident of the Lower East Side tenement hotel where Rusty
lives, a heroic and very conservative retired security guard. He
hates the noisy drag queens who practice their show tunes in
Rusty's fabulously cluttered apartment. But when Walt is laid low
by a stroke, and his pride and physical infirmity prevent him from
traveling to therapy, he must choke down his pride and take singing
lessons from Rusty to regain control of his voice.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro seems dead-on perfect, as ever, playing the subtlest
tics and most devastating infirmities of a recovering stroke
victim. He also superbly adapts Walt's short-tempered, intolerant
personality into the needy mode, and plays the character's
inevitable warming up to his despised benefactor with determinedly
obnoxious difficulty. He even exposes Walt's (and the script's)
most saving grace _ the character's well-camouflaged vulnerability
after a lifetime of intimate betrayals _ with a resonant, stoic
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can't help but think of him as this week's disease
person before you think of Walt as a fully formed individual.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hoffman makes Rusty as overly defensive and
snappish as he can be. For two polar opposites plot-forced to
accept and even become friends with one another, these guys make it
as hard, and by that as dramatically valid, as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that isn't the only drama on display here.
There's a thoroughly unnecessary thriller theme involving stolen
drug money that hijacks the climax to action movie territory
(admirably more personal as this project is for him, Schumacher
apparently couldn't bring himself to jettison the elements that
people went to his Batman and John Grisham movies for).
</P>
<P>
   We also get some idea of how New York's downscale drag community
operates, but only an idea. There's a Flawless beauty pageant that
we never see, arch encounters between flamboyant she-men and gay
Republicans, and haughty snapping and slapping between rival
transwhatevers. It all essentially reinforces stereotypes and
avoids specific insight _ and the same goes for the
heart-of-gold/stone/rock cocaine dichotomies set up among the
various hookers who populate the scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``Flawless'' marks a positive step in Schumacher's
development, (though his last two films, ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' and the
repulsive ``8mm,'' arguably left nowhere to go but up). It's also
another impressive De Niro gimmick job and the most elaborate one
of those yet from the talented and ever-developing Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   All the good parts just don't add up, though, to what the film
and we wish it was.

 &HT;    Gretzky inducted into hockey's Hall
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Wayne Gretzky hasn't worn a pair of skates since his
tearful farewell, No. 99 waving goodbye as he circled the rink one
last time.
</P>
<P>
   But to hockey fans, he will always glide on ice, remembered as
the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Just seven months and a few days after his final game at New
York's Madison Square Garden on April 18, Gretzky was inducted into
the Hockey Hall of Fame on Monday amid an outpouring of love rarely
showered on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   No. 99 in 1999. How perfect.
</P>
<P>
   A player is supposed to have to wait three years after
retirement to be eligible for the Hall of Fame. But not the Great
One, who first visited the Hall at its old location in Toronto when
he was 11. As a teenager he used to stand for hours looking at the
memorabilia and dreaming about someday playing in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have a plaque up there with all the ones I used to stare
at,'' said Gretzky, who was born about 70 miles away in Brantford,
Ontario. ``What a thrill. I never even dreamed about this. It's the
icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, 38, was inducted with retired referee Andy Van
Hellemond and Scotty Morrison, a former NHL referee-in-chief and
Hall of Fame chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison wore a kilt to the ceremonies. But he couldn't steal
the spotlight from Gretzky, who holds or shares 61 NHL records and
is Canada's most celebrated athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Van Hellemond said, ``I'll be part of a great hockey trivia
question, `Who were the other two stiffs that went in with No. 99?'
I wore No. 25, by the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame considered moving the induction ceremonies to
the nearby Air Canada Center, the new home of the Toronto Maple
Leafs. But Gretzky nixed the idea. ``He wanted to go in like
everyone else,'' said Bill Hay, chairman of the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets sold out quickly, with 2,000 people each paying $300
(Canadian) to sit in the BCE Place atrium and watch the ceremonies
on a large screen. About 500 invited guests were allowed into the
Hall of Fame for the ceremonies _ televised live in Canada and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Gretzky, all the time in Toronto, his every moved
chronicled. The Toronto Star and Toronto Sun both put out special
sections, although they already had published Wayne Gretzky
tributes when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was an emotional day for Gretzky. But not as emotional as
his last game, he said. ``I had peace of mind and knew I had made
the right decision,'' he said. ``But so many people were pulling at
me to keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky says he has no regrets about his decision, although he
``misses hockey greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss game day. I miss every day,'' he said. ``It's a special
bond athletes have. When you are no longer part of it, you are an
outsider looking in. All players go through it. We all become
ex-players. That's what I am now.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Gordie Howe retired, they said there would never be
another Gordie Howe. But then along came Bobby Orr. . . . Hockey
will always have its stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably miss hockey more than hockey misses Wayne
Gretzky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his next dream was, Gretzky said, ``To come back and
play again.'' Just joking. ``I said I would retire only one time,''
Gretzky said. ``And I'm officially retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from idle, however. He has appeared in commercials as an
endorser for everything from tires to hamburgers to pain remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to keep from missing hockey too much is to keep
busy,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky lives in Thousand Oaks, Calif., with his wife, former
actress Janet Jones, their two sons and a daughter. The boys enjoy
hockey, but Gretzky says he won't push them into the sport, as his
father did him.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Gretzky saved almost everything from his son's career,
and now it's part of a Hall of Fame exhibit that covers 2,300
square feet. ``We have everything but his pacifier,'' Hall official
Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proud time for Wayne and me,'' Walter Gretzky said.
``I miss seeing him play, but it was his decision. He thought it
was time to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Wayne Gretzky says, he might be a part of the NHL
again, not just one of its biggest fans. Certainly, he will return
to the ice, if only for fun.
</P>
<P>
   But first he must get a pair of skates. ``I don't have any
now,'' he said. ``I gave my skates to the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   GRETZKY'S ALL-TIME TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky calls himself a ``real hockey traditionalist.''
But there is nothing traditional about his all-time NHL all-star
team, which includes only one defenseman, a surprise pick in goal
-- and no Gretzky:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bobby Orr: ``With Bobby on your team, you need only one
defenseman. And with this lineup, we wouldn't have to worry about
defense, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Gordie Howe: ``My first, and still, hockey hero.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Maurice Richard: ``Who was ever better as a goal scorer?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jean Beliveau: ``One of my all-time favorites. He was so
elegant on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mario Lemieux: ``Best I ever played against in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant Fuhr: ``Not only the best goalie, but the greatest
athlete I ever saw play in the NHL. He was unbelievable with the
Oilers.''

   CASABLANCA, Morocco _ The trading floor of the Casablanca Stock
Exchange, with just 30 traders working in little computer cubicles,
is as quiet as a church and it is about to get even quieter.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the trading floor is shutting down, exchange
officials say, thrusting Casablanca's small, young, but
technologically hip stock market into the growing ranks of virtual
exchanges around the world.
</P>
<P>
   As in London, Paris, Brussels, Toronto, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and a
rising number of other places, brokers here will be trading
directly from their own offices in a kind of miniature Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be cruising on the electronic highway,'' said Zouheir
Bensaid, the immediate past president of the exchange and now a
senior executive at one of the country's biggest financial
companies, Group BMCE.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion will add efficiency to domestic trading and make
it technically possible for brokers anywhere to trade directly in
the Moroccan market. It is an impressive step, and one that several
other Middle East stock markets are expected to emulate in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
   After long, sleepy histories, this region's stock exchanges have
caught the attention of government officials as vital tools for
selling state-owned companies and attracting foreign investors as
they move from centrally planned economies to free enterprise. Like
the exchange here, in a mirror-paneled office block in downtown
Casablanca, many are being revitalized with advanced systems and
are attracting platoons of young Arab financial whizzes with MBA's
and job experience in New York, London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca's shift to decentralized, computerized operation
comes as the New York Stock Exchange, one of the remaining great
halls of hubbub and clanging bells, is debating a move toward
greater automation. It comes as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
with its shouting and hand-waving traders, has introduced the same
French-designed system the Moroccans are using.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the countries in this region are in the technological
vanguard, financial experts say, they will have to overcome
significant impediments before they can expect the kind of foreign
investment that has poured into the emerging markets of Asia, Latin
America and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for Morocco and neighbors like Tunisia, Lebanon and
Jordan is size. Their markets are minuscule. There are 55 companies
traded on the Casablanca exchange, with daily volume running at
about $10 million; in New York and London, many individual trades
surpass that figure. Tunisia has about 40 listings; Lebanon has a
little more than a dozen. Jordan has more than 150 companies
listed, but its daily trading volume is only about $2 million.
Although the Cairo Stock Exchange lists nearly 1,000 companies,
daily volume there is only about $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Blair, head of equity research on the Middle East and
North Africa at the London office of ABN Amro, the Dutch investment
bank and securities firm, said it was difficult for big
international investors even to consider putting money into a
market as small as Casablanca's. Mutual fund and pension fund
managers routinely put $500,000 to $5 million in a single
emerging-market stock. A daily volume of $10 million would not give
them much room to maneuver. ``You need to have high daily volumes
so you can get in and out of a stock easily,'' Blair said. ``The
last thing you want is for it to be difficult to sell while the
price is moving against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem in Morocco is that share prices are higher than
in the rest of the region _ more than twice the level, for example,
of those in Egypt. That is because, in an attempt to husband
foreign exchange, the government officially prohibits Moroccans
from investing abroad. Having no place else to go, the insurance
companies and the roughly 100 mutual funds that have sprung up here
in the last few years compete for the few stocks traded here,
pushing prices up.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, like some of its neighbors, has signed an agreement
with the European Union that will eliminate tariffs and, experts
say, probably lead to a loosening of foreign exchange and investing
restrictions. But, they say, the changes will take years.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring for several years, the market here has gone into a
long slump, starting toward the end of summer last year. Foreign
investors, who held about 6 percent of the market's shares, began
taking their gains, financial experts say, to offset losses in Asia
and the former Soviet Union. Local investors were scared and began
withdrawing their money. From September to the end of December, the
market lost 12 percent, but it still closed the year with a gain of
20 percent. This year, with the economy depressed by one of the
country's periodic droughts, the market has been mainly flat.
</P>
<P>
   But Rachid Ouali Alami, chairman of the Casablanca Stock
Exchange, and many of his colleagues see better days ahead. In the
coming year, he said, the government is expected to offer, for the
first time, a large number of shares in Royal Air Maroc, the
national airline, as well as in the national telephone company. One
banker said work was under way on at least a dozen initial public
offerings of private companies. One sign of confidence: Two new
brokerage firms have just taken seats on the Casablanca exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The big job for the financial community is to persuade more of
Morocco's privately owned businesses to go public, enabling the
exchange to grow. But, the financial experts say, that is not going
to be easy. Karim El Fekkak, director general of ABN Amro in
Casablanca, estimates that there are more than 500 companies with
more than $1 million in capital that would be candidates for the
exchange. But, like most businesses in Morocco, they are family
owned and so far have shown little interest in sharing ownership.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that makes them reluctant, said Eric Stoclet, head of
Citibank in Casablanca, is that the family-owned companies ``don't
want to open their books.'' In Tunis the government has given tax
breaks to companies that go public, and there has been talk of that
here. But here, as in many emerging markets, financial experts say,
the privately held businesses are believed to be enjoying
substantial tax breaks already, and these would be hard for the
government to top.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As free trade with the European Union develops, Fekkak said,
competition from European imports is likely to push some private
companies into the market in search of financing to expand and
create economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the region, the government here has been
criticized for dragging out the process of selling off state-owned
companies, which began in 1993. After decades of foreign domination
before independence in the 1950s and 1960s, all the governments
fear being accused of permitting foreigners to gain control of
important segments of the economy. That is one reason governments
in the region have put only minority shares of many companies on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   But in late summer the government here scored a big success. It
auctioned off a license for a mobile phone company for $1.1
billion, about three times what was expected. The winning bidders,
a consortium of Europeans and Moroccans, said they expected to
invest $800 million in equipment. This was privatization at its
best. The government, in effect, gave up a piece of paper _ the
license _ in return for lots of money and, almost certainly, a huge
improvement in telephone service in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the mobile phone company is expected to be traded on
the stock exchange. (Such a company is a star of the Egyptian
market.) But one of many government regulations that frustrate
Morocco's young, aggressive financiers prohibits any company _ no
matter how strong and stable it seems _ from selling shares until
it has done business in the country for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   In another drag on the stock market, the government this summer
introduced a capital gains tax of 10 percent, in response to
pressures from real estate brokers who said investment money that
once flowed to them was going into the stock market because of the
tax advantages. Foreign investors were exempt, but the tax was an
unsettling reminder of how terms of business can change overnight
in Morocco and other emerging markets. Early next year, the U.S.
Commerce Department plans to hold a conference in the United Arab
Emirates to encourage Middle East governments to work on
consistency in government administration and judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, the procedures here are clear,'' said Bensaid, who
studied at Cornell University and received a degree in business at
the University of Nevada. ``But in practice, things are not that
clear. Once you get involved in a problem in the courts, it can go
on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension with Algeria over Western Sahara, which in 1975 Morocco
claimed as an extension of its territory and where it still has
troops, remains a lingering uncertainty. But for Morocco's
financiers, the political picture brightened this summer with the
ascension to power of King Mohammed VI after the death of his
father, Hassan II, who had reigned for 38 years. Mohammed VI, 36,
has permitted the return from exile of political opponents of his
father and says he wants to reduce poverty and illiteracy.
Illiteracy is more than 40 percent, among the highest levels in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The young people giving the Casablanca Stock Exchange its spark
say that government officials, while cordial, have little training
or experience in finance. By contrast, the financiers felt an
instant rapport with the new king, they say, because of his youth
and his professed interest in bringing change to Morocco. He is
different from the men of his father's generation who have been
running the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our king,'' Bensaid said, ``is going to force those people to
let us do our work.''

 &HT;    Sweet day for Gary Nicklaus, but sour day for many more
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The sixth and final day of PGA Tour Qualifying School
always lives up to its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet end of the emotional spectrum Monday became Gary
Nicklaus, 30, son of Jack, shooting a final-round 63 to attain his
first PGA Tour card after a ninth trip to Q-School.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite fate came for Jaxon Brigman, 28, of Abilene, Texas,
who shot 8-under 412, but mistakenly signed for 7-under 413, and
missed by that single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the feeling when I found it out,'' Brigman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly shaken was Vic Wilk, who triple-bogeyed the Doral
Resort Gold Course's island-green 18th to drop from 9-under, in
with a stroke to spare, to 6-under, out by two.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Jay Hobby, who kept Brigman's scorecard, wrote down a
4 for the par-4 13th, but circled it as birdies usually are
designated. With five birdies, Brigman just counted the circles and
signed for a 5-under 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it didn't happen,'' said Hobby, who missed his tour
card, finishing at even-par 420. ``I bear some responsibility, but
in the end it's still his job to check the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech player Michael Clark, 30, of Dalton, Ga.,
secured his tour card after missing by one stroke in 1996 and 1998.
Clark tied for 10th at 405. ``It's awesome,'' Clark said after a
69. ``My nerves got the best of me out there today, but I hung in.
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Also qualifying was Atlanta's Jason Buha of Duke, who tied for
30th at 9-under, and former Charleston player Jason Caron
(8-under). Ryuji Imada (67) missed by a shot at 7-under, and Tripp
Isenhour was off by two at 6-under.

   It was a nightmarish day for Moultrie, Ga.'s Kevin Blanton, who
woke up at 1 a.m. sweating and vomiting, then fought dehydration.
Starting at 7-under, Blanton bogeyed three of his first four holes
to destroy his chances for a tour card and finally struggled to a
73 for 4-under 416. He must settle for fully exempt status on the
Buy.com Tour in 2000.

   Jack and Barbara Nicklaus were unable to follow their son
Monday. Instead, they attended the funeral in Latrobe, Pa., for
Arnold Palmer's wife, Winnie. Gary Nicklaus finished at 14-under
406, tying for 12th, five strokes behind medalist Blaine
McCallister, the 41-year-old tour veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long grind,'' Gary said. ``Six rounds this week, a
total of 14 through first and second stage. That's a lot of
pressure the last month and a half.''

FCC PROPOSES AN AUDIO CHANNEL TO NARRATE TV ACTION FOR THE BLIND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission has proposed
that broadcasters be required to adopt technology allowing the
blind to follow the action on television by listening to a narrator
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, part of a broader FCC plan to make
telecommunications more accessible to Americans with disabilities,
would introduce to a large number of stations an innovation that is
now used, voluntarily, by just a few _ most of them public
television channels _ which apply the technology to a limited
number of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is the most important cultural medium in our
society,'' William E. Kennard, the commission's chairman, said in
an interview. ``It is a shared experience that connects people. And
we must do all that we can to break down the barriers to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 54 million Americans with disabilities, the commission
says, 8 million to 12 million are blind or have only partial sight.
``We cannot leave these people behind,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology works by allowing the user to turn on a secondary
audio programming channel, where a narrator describes the action
during pauses in the dialogue. Audiences can hear that a character
sadly buries his face in his hands, for example, or that someone is
creeping through a darkened hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Newscasts, sports coverage (which typically includes
play-by-play descriptions) and talk shows would be exempt from the
rules, because the regular audio is generally sufficient to allow a
vision-impaired audience to follow those programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bobeck, a spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcasters, said the association was studying the proposal and
would comment later. But in the three years that the rules have
been under discussion, a number of broadcasters have pointed out
that in some markets the secondary channel is already used for
Spanish and other foreign-language audio, a potential conflict. The
cost of providing video descriptions is another concern among
broadcasters, whose comments on equipment and programming costs are
being solicited by the FCC in the period of broader public comment
that will now ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The video description rules were unanimously approved by Kennard
and the four other commissioners last Thursday but will not become
final until after the public-comment period, lasting several
months. They are to be modeled on the existing closed-captioning
rules for the hearing-impaired _ that is, they are to require
initially that network-affiliated broadcasters in the top 25
television markets provide video descriptions for roughly four
hours a week of prime-time programming or children's programming.
This standard, which the broadcasters would have to meet no later
than 18 months after final approval of the rules, would later be
expanded to more hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal is limited to analog broadcasting, it
could later be applied to the emerging digital broadcasting as well
as to cable operators, satellite operators and home satellite dish
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Public television has been active in the video description
effort for more than a decade. WGBH in Boston, for example, began
to narrate the popular programs ``Masterpiece Theater'' and
``Nature'' in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Crawford, executive director of the American Council of
the Blind, said people with loss of vision were at a disadvantage
in communicating with friends and colleagues about popular culture
because they missed so much of what occurred in sitcoms and
television dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for access, and for the family,'' Crawford
said of the proposal. ``It will relieve the burden of having a
loved one describe what is happening on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Pfanstiehl, chairwoman of the National Television Video
Access Coalition, called the proposal an ``enormous victory'' and a
``major breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pfanstiehl, who was awarded an Emmy in 1990 for her
leadership and persistence in making television accessible to those
with vision problems, said description of on-screen action would be
important for people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Chet Avery, a blind retired administrator for the Education
Department, who attended the meeting where the FCC approved the
rules last week, said: ``Everyone is going to win as a result of
this. Access is going to be expanded, and isn't that what democracy
is all about?''

CAR LOAN TURNS INTO A REAL LEMON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reader response to a recent column on the spread and
officiousness of monopolies convinces me that I must have touched a
nerve. Many of the comments reveal a brooding sense of alienation,
of being taken for granted and treated with cavalier indifference
by the ever bigger and more remotely run companies with which the
public is increasingly forced to deal.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist in California writes of the ``dehumanizing''
effect of this trend toward megalopolies, and the frustrating
inability of customers to get anyone to listen. He decries what he
sees happening as the ``micro-miniaturization of the individual.''
He says it's making people ill.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent complaint expressed to me is the frustration
of trying to communicate with anyone in authority.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the story of Kay and Craig Nelson and how they became
innocently entangled, to their relentless harassment, with the
computer of a large, distant finance company.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelsons own a suburban home. Their kids are grown, now
finished with college. Both have decent jobs. They're trying to put
just a bit aside each month toward retirement. Their credit record
has been spotless.
</P>
<P>
   In June of last year, they bought an almost-new Chrysler from a
reputable local dealer. He handled interim financing through the
Chase Manhattan auto financing division of Wilmington, Del., allied
with one of America's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   But Kay figured that they could save $500 or so in interest over
the life of the payments by borrowing from the Fort Worth Federal
Credit Union, to which she belongs. That loan was arranged, and the
credit union sent Chase a check retiring the Nelsons' car note in
full before their first payment was due.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of trouble came in the late summer of 1998. A
surprise telephone call at their residence insisted that their auto
payments to the Delaware company were two months in arrears. They
explained that the note had been paid off. Their caller said fine!
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, they received a letter, printed and unsigned, from
Chase ordering them to pay $902 in arrearages ``without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Their credit union, notified, immediately called the Delaware
company, whose officer claimed that they'd never received the June
check. Credit union loan officer Kyle Victry assured Chase that he
was putting a second check (for $21,821.62) in the overnight mail
and stopping payment on the first.
</P>
<P>
   Chase promptly credited the account with this amount, noting
that it included ``all interest due and complete payoff.'' This
should have ended it.
</P>
<P>
   Victry recalls expressly asking, and being assured, that the
Nelson family's credit record be protected from any negative
reflection. The Nelsons breathed a sigh of relief. But not for
long.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, they received another telephone call at home
from Chase's telephonic collectors, stating that payments were
overdue and demanding that the Nelsons pay up promptly! Unable to
satisfy her insistent caller, Kay visited her credit union again.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, Victry once more called Chase Manhattan, reminding
the company that the account had been closed and faxing copies of
the canceled check and previous correspondence. Fine, he was
assured.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, another harassing call. Same result. Same
assurances.
</P>
<P>
   Comes Nov. 24. Another collection call from Chase's dunning
team. This time, the caller insisted the Nelsons owed Chase more
than $3,000, demanding immediate payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once,'' recalls Craig Nelson, ``my wife has been
near tears in anger and frustration from trying to stop this
recurring harassment, which was Chase's error in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Again the Nelsons called Chase, were assured that all records
would be cleared up ``by the end of the week.'' They wouldn't be
bothered further.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 9, Chase unaccountably mailed the Nelsons a book
of blank payment coupons. By now gun-shy, Kay called once more,
just for reassurance. Told that ``the account is clear. It has a
zero balance,'' Kay asked for a letter to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was puzzling. It said that the account was closed and
that ``your final payment of $25.32 was received on Wednesday, Dec.
2.''
</P>
<P>
   Goofy, since the whole thing had been paid off in June, and
again in September. But reassuring. The matter was ended.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it?
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Craig _ attracted by the interest-free claims of a
new credit card advertisement _ wrote for information and an
application form. On April 2, he received a rejection, saying that
Trans Union Corp. of Springfield, Penn., (one of three major credit
bureaus) had reported derogatory information.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled, Nelson wrote Trans Union. That company replied that
Chase Manhattan in December (two months after acknowledging receipt
of the second final payment) had reported the Nelsons' account 120
days overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, this private American family (my daughter and
son-in-law, as it happens), who'd never been behind on any of their
payments to anyone, have tried earnestly _ shall I say maddeningly?
_ to clear up their credit record.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's more than a year since the Nelsons' credit records
should have been purged of the hurtful stain so undeservedly dumped
on them by the distant bank. But last month, applying to open a
department store account, Kay was embarrassed before friends and
told her credit was unworthy, based on ``negative information from
Chase Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, usually laid back, is boiling now. He has hired a lawyer
to straighten things out with the muscle-bound megabank. More power
to him!
</P>
<P>
   Wake up, all you greedy, distant, computer-driven institutions.
Take a moment from counting profits to consider the private
citizens whose lives you can so carelessly disrupt.

GRETZKY ACCEPTS HOCKEY'S TOP HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Looking trim, fit, and rested, Wayne Gretzky
blushingly accepted hockey's greatest honor here Monday, pulling on
the Hockey Hall of Fame's dark blue blazer and slipping one more
sparkling ring of distinction on his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure of my next dream,'' said the 38-year-old icon,
who grew up in Brantford, Ontario, merely an hour's drive from the
august, mahogany-paneled hall. ``I spent 26 years of my life
dreaming that I'd be a part of _ and then staying in _ the National
Hockey League. I want to be clear-minded about (what's next), and
right now I'm not exactly sure what that will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The bet here is that Gretzky, who for the better part of two
decades made smithereens of the NHL record book, is a key player
again in the game, but as an owner, his stick and sweater swapped
for spread sheet and business suit.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a surprise to see that happen before 2004, the year
the current Collective Bargaining Agreement expires, because NHL
franchises at the moment are a sure ticket to bankruptcy rather
than a license to print money. Gretzky continues to amass a fortune
_ the endorsement business is that strong _ even seven months after
retiring from the Rangers. But the economics of the game at the
moment are so, shall we say, precarious (witness Roger Marino's $45
million loss in Pittsburgh and the $80 million Peter Karmanos is in
the process of blowing in Carolina), that it takes a billionaire's
cavalier mindset and black-hole pockets to even consider getting in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, either player salaries will have become manageable
(recent cheaper signings of unrestricted free agents have given
promise there) or league owners will implement another lockout,
only this time with the resolve not to put down the ice until the
players agree to a legitimate salary cap. One way or the other, the
X factor of labor cost will be something other than the current
game of dead-man's roulette.
</P>
<P>
   When all that comes into focus, the suspicion here is that
Gretzky, a master of timing his entire career, will swoop in and
purchase a franchise, most likely with a partner or two. It would
be everything he has stood for in his life: a challenge, a true
competition, with dollar signs rather than Stanley Cups defining
wins and losses.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years after playing in his first game, Gretzky, who
was inducted along with Ian ``Scotty'' Morrisson (builder) and
referee Andy Van Hellemond, appeared comfortable and content during
the ceremony before some 200 media members.
</P>
<P>
   The Gretzky trademark humility, as telltale as his No. 99 and
his perfectly executed passes, remained predictably intact.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Gretzky on:
</P>
<P>
   --How he changed the game _ ``I don't think any one person is
going to be bigger than the game. I don't think any one person can
drastically make changes in the game. It's a great game, and it
will continue to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   --Whether he'd like to see a trophy named in his honor _ ``One
of the special aspects of the league is its collection of trophies,
like the Stanley Cup, the Art Ross Trophy, the Hart Trophy. It's
something our league has that a lot of other leagues don't have. I
played in the '80s and '90s. I think before anything is done for
Wayne Gretzky, something has to be done for players like Gordie
Howe and Bobby Orr. I'm way down the totem pole in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if anyone showed up expecting Gretzky once and
for all to exhort a well-deserved, ``Yahoo! Check this out, man, I
did it!,'' then they haven't been paying attention for the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was appropriately glassy-eyed when he stood to pull on
the Hall's blue jacket. More telling, his face turned a deep red.
There are those who can fake a tear or two, but even those who have
won as many Oscars as Gretzky has won Stanleys (4) cannot on cue
turn the hue of that line that runs across the middle of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Great One was clearly touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to come to the Hall of Fame when it was at Exhibition
Place,'' he recalled. ``I used to come for hours and look at the
old pictures _ I loved to look at those, along with the old
sweaters and old sticks. The Hall of Fame didn't have interactive
exhibits then. You came to the Hall and you read, you looked, you
absorbed, and yeah you dreamed of being in the NHL. But I don't
think any of us thought we were good enough to be in the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the stage where his son talked, Walter Gretzky
sounded overwhelmed by it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' said the senior Gretzky, wearing a leather
jacket with his famous son's name on the chest. ``I mean, this is
hockey, right here, this is the shrine.''
</P>
<P>
   When the induction was over, Gretzky strolled around the Hall
and did exactly what he did as a kid, only this meandering along a
lengthy row of display cases told his story. Thanks to his dad, a
meticulous keeper of artifacts (read: pack rat), Gretzky's life has
been chronicled from his very first pair of leather skates (barely
big enough to hold two decent-sized eggs).
</P>
<P>
   Above the Gretzky display, a wonderful videotape plays over and
over, spiced by remarks from dad and son. For the record, the
backyard rink in Brantford wasn't put up for the purpose of turning
Wayne into a hockey wonder. It was, said Walter, simply a response
to standing around cold rinks while his son played.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, I could stay in the house and keep warm,'' said
Walter. ``It was self-preservation, and that's the honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, the Great One had to admit, ``A nice feeling to walk
around and see your picture there.''
</P>
<P>
   All those games and points later, his likeness will remain
there, in perpetuity. For generations to stand, to stare, to
absorb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably miss the game more than the game misses Wayne
Gretzky,'' said the humble honoree.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that's true, but it's equally doubtful he'll be gone
too long.

   DANTE, Va. _ She always wanted to ride the Santa Train.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up a coal miner's daughter, she stood beside the tracks
every year awaiting the caboose carrying the jolly bearded man who
tossed out candy and early Christmas presents to the children of
Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always took our paper pokes _ pokes is Dante-ish for bag or
sack _ and waited for the loud scream of the train and Christmas
music,'' recalled Vickie Addington. ``How forward we looked to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after her own children were grown and gone from this
Critchfield Coal Company town, Vickie and her husband, Eugene,
would be out with their neighbors every November when the train
stopped here briefly on its cheerful journey from Pikeville, Ky.,
to Kingsport, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this fall, at the age of 47, she was diagnosed with
terminal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream has always been to ride the Santa Train,'' Mrs.
Addington confessed in a letter to the Kingsport Chamber of
Commerce. Along with the CSX Railroad, the chamber has sponsored
the annual holiday trip for 57 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not begging,'' she stressed, for hard times forge proud
folk. But it ``would be my dream come true'' to stand beside Santa
and ``throw candy to our Appalachian children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't require oxygen and only a few medications,'' she said.
And Eugene would go along to help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never imagine how great I would feel for the first
time in a long while,'' she wrote. ``Please allow us to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, only Grinches conducting a Scrooge Train would deny such a
request. Of course, the good-hearted sponsors welcomed Vickie and
Eugene Addington to make the trip.

   As it has for over half a century, the Santa Claus Special
rolled out of Shelby Yard near Pikeville around sunrise on the
Saturday before Thanksgiving. The event began in 1943 as a
promotion by the merchants of Kingsport to kick off the holiday
shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   For some poor families in the hardscrabble hollows, though,
those early trains brought the bulk of their Christmas cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get much candy otherwise,'' recalled Juanita
Jackson, standing by the tracks in Elkhorn City, Ky., with her
daughters, granddaughters and neighbors. Times are considerably
better now, but the Santa Train is still a Jackson family
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always get up at 6 a.m. to be here on time,'' lamented Amy
Jackson, who came home from college in Roanoke, Va., for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets you in the Christmas mood,'' said Jean Vandyke, a
Jackson in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Over three decades aboard the Santa Train, Frank Brogden has
seen ``a substantial improvement in the lives of the people'' who
stand beside the tracks. Indeed, this year's gifts included ``Lion
King'' videotapes for the children and Denver Bronco ``Super Bowl
Season'' videotapes for their fathers. The sponsors figured that
many mountain cabins have VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   The train still rolls past some rusted carcasses of cars and
ramshackle house trailers perched precariously on the rugged,
wooded mountainsides. But many families arrive at their favorite
spots in new SUVs. Men wear camouflage fatigues and orange caps of
deer hunting season. Women are dressed in jeans and holiday
sweatshirts. Children are bright-eyed and well-scrubbed. The mood
is nostalgic and festive rather than desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ``we focus on the tradition,'' said Brogden, a retired
public relations executive who has served as Santa for the past 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming for the last 40 years,'' said Valerie Damron,
holding her grandson, Preston, as Santa threw out gifts at
Dungannon, Va. ``I brought my children and now my grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember snow and ice building up on my mittens as I waited
by the track. I would get a little ruler and some pencils and some
candy,'' said Colleen Massey, who grew up in Dante (which rhymes
with ``can't'' hereabouts). She lives in Tennessee now, but returns
each year to relive her childhood experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the train comes around the bend, the tears start
flowing,'' she said. ``It's so emotional and I enjoy it so much.''

   Vickie Addington bought a new hat for the trip after losing her
hair to chemotherapy. Even her eyelashes fell out after the potent
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   She compared the moment that she heard her diagnosis of
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma to the childhood moment when she heard that
President Kennedy has been shot. ``I was once again frozen in
time,'' she recalled in her letter.
</P>
<P>
   But in the following weeks, thoughts of her holiday trip eased
her worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``She bought a new Christmas outfit to wear,'' said her husband.
``Every day, she would tell me, 'We're going to ride that train'.''
</P>
<P>
   Living on a miner's pension after 25 years underground, Eugene
Addington has Santa Train memories of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born the year the train began and I was at it every
year. We lived beside the track,'' he said. ``I always looked
forward to getting those little pop guns.''

   The Santa Train is practically a year-round operation. This
year, 15 tons of candy and clothes and toys were distributed to
thousands of people along the 110-mile route.
</P>
<P>
   Contributed food and merchandise ``comes in literally by the
truckload,'' said Miles Burdine, executive director of the
Kingsport Chamber. The donated bounty is collected during the year
at a supermarket warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the trip, the presents are put into coded plastic
bins _ gray for foodstuffs, red for toys and clothes _ and
systematically arranged in railcars for distribution. Santa and his
helpers shouldn't run out of stuff to throw out along the way but
also don't want anything left over at the end of their run.
</P>
<P>
   The late Charles Kuralt did a CBS-TV ``On the Road'' segment
aboard the Santa Train some years back and the worldwide attention
and contributions have escalated since then. The monetary donations
have reached a level to where the Chamber now awards a $5,000
college scholarship each year to a deserving high school senior who
lives along the route.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Transportation sends up special rail cars from its corporate
headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla., for the trip and celebrities
clamor to be a Santa's helper. Last year, country music star Travis
Tritt made the trip. This year, Patty Loveless helped throw out the
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some cousins,'' said the singer, who was born in
Pikeville but moved away at the age of 10. ``The hardest part was
waving at them and not being able to stop and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was wild when the train would stop for 10 minutes or
so at a town and presents would rain down on the excited crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Holding her grandson in Elkhorn City, Evaughn Campbell was hit
in the forehead by the hard edge of a flying Little Golden Book.
Two nurses rushed from the train to wash the blood from her face
and dress the cut. Meanwhile, Santa's helpers kept the grandson
happy with gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the settlements, though, families stood in lonesome
spots all along the route and waved at the passing train. ``A dozen
kids are coming up on the left,'' a spotter would yell on the
platform behind the caboose. Santa and helpers would throw stuffed
animals, Moon Pies, Barbie Dolls, Hershey Bars or any of a myriad
other goodies on the railbed.
</P>
<P>
   Waving and shouting ``Merry Christmas'' as the train sped away,
the children would scramble onto the tracks to pick up their
presents.
</P>
<P>
   Eight or more hours of throwing out presents and shouting ``Ho.
Ho. Ho.'' makes for ``a very demanding day,'' said Brogden.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trip, Santa leaves the train and boards a fire
engine to ride in the annual Kingsport Christmas Parade.

   Sadly, they buried Vickie Addington a few hours after the Santa
Train passed through Dante on the Saturday before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Her death had come the night before she and Eugene were
scheduled to board the train in Kingsport and ride to Pikeville to
begin this year's journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last words she told me were 'I love you','' said her
husband. ``I found her dead in the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, he hopes to ride the train in the memory of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to go so bad,'' he said.

U.S. PROSECUTOR ASKS COURT TO OVERSEE BOXING GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Skedded in FRONTPAGE as BOX-INDICT) 
(lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In the first attempt by federal law enforcement
officials to take over a private sports organization, the U.S.
attorney's office asked a federal judge on Monday to appoint a
monitor to run the International Boxing Federation, whose leaders
were indicted early this month on racketeering and bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutors' request is granted in a hearing scheduled
for Tuesday, the IBF would become the first sports group to join a
collection of organizations, including the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Fulton Fish Market in New York,
that have been taken over by the courts amid allegations of
corruption and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   In making the request in a civil lawsuit, the prosecutors asked
that Zachary Taylor, a former U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., be
appointed as the monitor. He would have subpoena power and a
sweeping mandate to restructure the organization and to replace all
its top officials, with the overall goal of changing the way the
organization does business.
</P>
<P>
   The boxing federation, with headquarters in East Orange, is the
only U.S.-based organization that ranks boxers and sanctions
championship bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the action are expected to raise fears that federal
prosecutors and judges are trying to establish themselves as the
equivalent of boxing czars in the absence of any congressional
mandate. But for those who have long criticized the IBF and other
boxing ranking groups as corrupt and manipulated by a few
well-placed people in the industry, the request is likely to be
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit, filed by U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary, the
chief federal prosecutor for northern New Jersey, comes nearly
three weeks after a federal grand jury indicted the four top
officials of the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-count indictment accused the officials of soliciting
bribes from fighters and promoters to move boxers up in the
rankings. Such rankings, whether given by the International Boxing
Federation, the World Boxing Council or the World Boxing
Association, allow fighters to qualify for bouts with television
proceeds that can run into millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is the first time that government has sought to
take control of a sports organization,'' Cleary said at a news
conference announcing the civil action. ``Along with the indictment
of November 4, this constitutes a devastating one-two punch to the
IBF, which we seek to resurrect as an organization free of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Lee Sr., the IBF president, who was among the
officials indicted, called the latest action by Cleary's office
unfair and said it would create turmoil in boxing. Lee said the
request for a court-appointed monitor amounted to saying that he
and his three co-defendants in the federal racketeering case were
guilty before they had gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little heavy-handed and they are out to make it
appear that I am guilty until proven innocent,'' he said in an
interview. ``If I am convicted, it's another story. But to come in
and create this kind of turmoil looks like something that is
orchestrated to create problems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gerard Lynch, a professor at Columbia University's School of
Law, said that the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act of 1970 provided a powerful tool for criminal prosecutions by
the federal authorities and also created a number of civil
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The law permits the government, with the approval of a judge, to
intervene immediately in the affairs of a business or union when
there is concern about the disposition of assets. That the leaders
of a business or a union are under criminal indictment is important
in such cases, but it is not the only factor that determines
whether a judge appoints a court monitor.
</P>
<P>
   These civil racketeering actions have been criticized in the
past by the affected unions, which have complained that such
actions give prosecutors and judges the authority to make policy
that is usually reserved for Congress. Lynch said that some critics
of the tactics used by Cleary's office may argue that prosecutors
are trying to enter an area where Congress has refused to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' he said, ``U.S. attorneys have been known to bring
cases such as this that are designed to impact whole industries.''
Lynch recalled drives against white-collar crime, including
securities fraud on Wall Street, by Rudolph Giuliani when he was
the U.S. attorney in New York in the 1980s. ``I'm sure that the
primary position of the prosecutor's office here is that they are
not trying to regulate boxing but are trying to clean up corruption
and crime wherever they find it.''

<P>
   An exercise in perceptions: Throw white-trash hillbillies on
``Jerry Springer'' and it's considered exploitative fisticuffs.
Present them in an HBO documentary directed by a scion of the
Kennedy dynasty, however, and it's a sensitive evocation of a
disappearing culture.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with Rory Kennedy's ``American Hollow,'' one in an
ongoing series of documentaries of life in these United States in
HBO's ``America Undercover'' series. This is one of those
documentaries that isn't really about anything in particular; the
cameras simply spend a year flitting like horseflies around
68-year-old Irie Bowling and her family _ her husband, Bass, their
13 kids, 30 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. All but a
son dwell in the remote Kentucky hills of Mudlick Hollow (at least
the scenery is pretty), where they're uniformly underemployed and
underengaged by life _ quaffing beer seems to be as good as it gets
'round these parts. Nonetheless, Kennedy follows the clan around,
hoping something compelling will happen.
</P>
<P>
   And something does, sort of, eventually, but Kennedy never quite
captures on film whatever it is about Irie and her kin that
inspired her and that she thought might be instructive for the rest
of the country. Likewise, it's unclear why we should be lamenting
the inevitable passing of this backward culture, as this
hard-scrabble brood clearly demonstrates that innocence and naivete
aren't all they're cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   There's Lanzo, one of Irie's sons, who drops pearls of wisdom
like, ``If you can't help yourself, you can't help nobody _ you
ever think of that?'' and gets fidgety because his Prozac hasn't
arrived from town. (Pep pills and ubiquitous satellite dishes are
the main evidence that the 20th century has arrived in the
Appalachians _ otherwise, the Bowling homes seem what might be
charitably called ramshackle.) Edgar, another son, is jailed under
suspicion of breaking and entering; he's eventually released, but
not before Bass sagely observes, ``Ain't no disgrace being put in
jail, just staying there'' (many in the family seem to have a
couple of drunk and disorderlies on their police record).
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Samantha veers most uncomfortably into Springer
territory, fleeing a violently abusive husband that the rest of the
family can't seem to control. Then there's Clint, a high-school
senior, who seems to comprehend that Mudlick life is a deadend, but
finds it tough to summon up the courage to leave. He'd stay if his
girlfriend Shirley would just agree to marry him _ Shirley's an old
maid by Appalachian standards; she notes that she has friends who
got married in the seventh grade and were moms by age 12, though
she allows, ``I do think that's kinda young.'' When Clint and
Shirley go through one of their routine separations, however,
Clint's own dark, misogynist side seeps through.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is punctuated by brief, incongruously perky segments
in which the family celebrates sundry holidays, accompanied by
sprightly bluegrass music on the soundtrack. But Kennedy has
unearthed too many unsettling facts about these hayseeds to
convincingly portray them as carefree in these moments. Just as the
Bowlings scour the hillsides for roots and moss that earns them
meager dollars, ``American Hollow'' pans for the grit in this
bucolic setting and discovers sobering yet unsurprising truths
about a long-ago and far-away terrain where you wouldn't even want
to visit, let alone live.

RIGHTS CASE A TEST OF RUSSIAN JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If retired navy captain Alexander Nikitin thought he
was off the hook when a Russian court dismissed espionage charges
against him last year, he was wrong. Tuesday he will be back on
trial again, defending himself against the same accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups say that Nikitin's plight is a disturbing reminder
that rule of law can be a malleable thing when it suits the
interests of Russia's powerful military and security services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this case is decided on its merits and according to the
law, we will win,'' said Yury Shmidt, Nikitin's defense attorney,
Monday. ``Our only fear is that certain political forces will try
to pressure the court and influence the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired naval officer turned environmentalist, Nikitin was
arrested in February 1996 by the Federal Security Service or FSB,
successor to the feared Soviet-era KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's crime? He co-authored a report on the slipshod
handling of nuclear waste by Russia's northern fleet. Nikitin said
he used only public sources to write the report and was acting in
the public's interests -- trying to bring international attention
to what he calls a creeping ecological disaster _ in hopes of
attracting funds for a clean up.
</P>
<P>
   The FSB, saying Nikitin revealed state secrets, branded him a
traitor and a spy.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 10 months in prison, Nikitin was released on bond
in December 1996. In October of last year, a court in St.
Petersburg ruled that the FSB -- after investigating for nearly
three years -- had not proven its espionage case against Nikitin.
But under Russian law, a verdict of not guilty does not necessarily
mean innocent. Instead of clearing Nikitin, the court ordered the
FSB to investigate further and come up with stronger evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now they will bring their case to court again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Nikitin said in an interview Monday. ``I don't
want to make any predictions, but I am confident we can win. I hope
that the voice of the world community will be heard and we will
overcome the arbitrary rule of the FSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's case has attracted attention all over the world. When
he was in jail, the rights group Amnesty International labeled him
a ``prisoner of conscience,'' the first Russian accorded that
designation since the late Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov. Senator
Edward Kennedy and four other United States senators have signed a
letter to the court in support of Nikitin, Kennedy's Washington
office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case has had its fair share of Kafka-like absurdities.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin was charged with revealing state secrets through his
environmental work, although Russia's constitution forbids
ecological information from being classified. He was held for eight
months before he was formally charged. When he was, the indictment
was classified and investigators said its contents were so secret
that even they didn't know its contents.
</P>
<P>
   The report Nikitin co-authored, published by the Norwegian
environmental group Bellona, has been branded ``forbidden
literature'' by the authorities here. Customs officials have
confiscated hundreds of copies of the report, which is available on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With the FSB following him and his family around, Nikitin feared
for their safety. His 21-year-old daughter Yulya now studies at Mt.
Ida College in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law was followed in the first place, Nikitin would have
never been arrested. If the law is followed now, this case will be
dismissed tomorrow,'' said St. Petersburg-based human rights
activist Yury Vdovin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nikitin's case was the first high-profile prosecution
of an environmental researcher, it is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   In July, military journalist Grigory Pasko was convicted of
improper conduct - but acquitted of espionage - for filing reports
to a Japanese television station about nuclear dumping by Russia's
pacific fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FSB raided the apartment and laboratory of
physicist and environmentalist Vladimir Soifer, who was studying
nuclear contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FSB charged Igor Sutyagin, a leading Russian
nuclear arms researcher who studied nuclear safety issues, with
treason. Boston native Josh Handler, a graduate student from
Princeton University, had his Moscow apartment searched and was
questioned in Sutyagin's case. Handler has since left Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Prime Minister Vladimir Putin - who was then FSB
director - warned that Russia's security services were going to
crack down on ecologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, foreign secret services use not only diplomatic cover,
but very actively use all sorts of ecological organizations,''
Putin said in July. ``This is why regardless of pressure from the
public and the media, such organizations will always be the focus
of our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was worried that as premier, Putin would now
influence the court in Nikitin's case, his lawyer said: ``I just
hope that the prime minister is too busy with other matters to
worry about our case.''

STANDARDS SOUGHT FOR NEW INDUSTRY OF CRIME-SCENE CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ariz., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Once cadavers and evidence are removed from a
typical crime scene, police and paramedics drive away, leaving a
traumatized family and an opportunity for a delicate enterprise now
quietly evident across the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family just went through this horrific event and now they
have to clean up, too?'' Becky Della-Rodolfa said, describing the
rationale of her private Philadelphia business that specializes in
the cleaning and repairing of the aftermath of homicides, suicides
and other mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 such companies have been started in urban areas in
recent years, according to a Washington lobbying association that
is seeking government standards for an industry that practitioners
find fraught with public health and professional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need standard ethics and procedural rules for a business
that is growing by leaps and bounds,'' said Ron Gospodarski,
president of the lobbying group, the American Bio-Recovery
Association. The three-year-old association serves an industry that
is thriving on the fact that government agencies generally make no
provision to clean up the scenes of traumatic deaths.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is Phoenix, where the municipal government has
contracted with Dale Cillian, an industry pioneer with 15 years'
experience, to clean up after biohazardous crimes and accidents,
from homicides to car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be under the same standards as the funeral
industry,'' Cillian said, warning that fly-by-night operators have
been appearing more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   His business, Biopro LLC, has cleaned more than 5,000 crime and
accident scenes using high-tech equipment and
medical-waste-disposal techniques that the national association
wants established as a government requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a paramedic for 18 years,'' Gospodarski said. He runs a
trauma cleanup company in the New York City area that routinely
deals with blood-borne and airborne contaminants at scenes of
violent deaths or deaths that are not immediately discovered. His
workers, wearing protective gear, move in after police and rip out
floorboards and wall panels in tracking the flow of wastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us got into it from public safety jobs because we got
tired of seeing families shocked in the midst of tragedy as they
watched cops and medics just strip off their gloves and walk
away,'' Gospodarski said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted the premium on speed in his business, citing one recent
overnight cleanup at a New York restaurant where four people were
shot to death. ``An eight-hour job, very messy, blood trails on the
walls through the place, and the manager was very, very grateful we
could be there within 30 minutes,'' Gospodarski said of his
company, Bio-Recovery Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Della-Rodolfa started her business, Trauma Scene
Restoration, when she heard a friend who was a police officer talk
of the frustration of leaving shocked families behind after a
death. ``I don't think society knows this type of industry
exists,'' she said, describing the largely unadvertised manner of
the business in which a funeral director, medical examiner or
sympathetic ambulance driver might inform a family of a local
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restoring the scene and peace of mind'' is the motto of Ms.
Della-Rodolfa's small company, as printed in an advertisement in
the local yellow pages under House Cleaning. It is embossed as well
on packets of golf tees that she distributes at police and medical
examiners' conventions. ``They love golf,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't call up troubled families _ that would be unethical
ambulance chasing,'' Ms. Della-Rodolfa declared as she dealt with a
new job. It involved cleaning the home of an elderly recluse who
had died alone in a house knee-deep in trash, with 12 cats left
unattended for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This job will cost $30 an hour and require some messy labor, she
estimated. Other jobs at scenes of violence or extended
decomposition, with potentially infectious blood and other waste,
cost $100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   She has a staff of three full-time workers with others on call.
They use an array of disposable clothing and respirators, and
subcontract with a medical-waste company to burn all corpse-related
residue.
</P>
<P>
   This precaution is something that Gospodarski would like to see
made a government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He described a job in the Bronx, N.Y., involving a man whose
body was found two weeks after death and who turned out to have had
hepatitis and been HIV-positive. Effluvia had seeped into the
apartment below, creating a potentially nightmarish situation that
local health officials knew nothing about, Gospodarski said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond violent deaths, decomposition cases involving people who
died alone and neglected make up half of his business, Gospodarski
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Cillian, who is a firefighter, obtained a general
contractor's license to qualify for the dismantling and repairing
that can be required at a noisome crime scene. He routinely strips
carpets and tile, replaces wall and floor panels and uses
high-pressure water and vacuuming equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs average about $350, but chaotic crime scenes can cost
thousands, he said, noting that he does pro bono work in cases of
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of shootings out here, and the scene at one of
them looked like a war zone,'' he said of a recent shootout between
a police officer and his killer. ``A hundred rounds were fired. The
place was pocked like a movie set.'' When he heard that the police
officer's grieving family members wanted to see the scene, Cillian
said, he had all the bullet-torn doors and blood-stained surfaces
removed or covered to spare them extra trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including New York, offer crime victims up to
$2,500 for their expenses, and lately trauma cleanup costs have
been accepted, Gospodarski said. But home insurance claims are more
open to dispute, as in instances of suicide, Ms. Della-Rodolfa
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can mean the second trauma,'' she said. ``This is when a
family must relive the first one all over again by cleaning it
up.''

 &HT;    Georgia attorney general not sure if Bible classes would survive
challenges
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Georgia wants to teach the Bible in public schools,
it faces a number of legal risks, the state attorney general said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thurbert Baker said he cannot assure the state
school board that Bible history courses would survive challenges
under the Georgia or U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courses that include reference to the Bible may survive First
Amendment scrutiny only if their content is determined to be
secular and they are taught in a secular, objective manner,'' Baker
said in an opinion sought by the state Board of Education in
August.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of Baker's six-page letter, the opinion made it
seem difficult, if not impossible, to make that judgment call
without seeing how the course was actually taught.
</P>
<P>
   Courses only about the Bible are inherently suspect, federal
courts have found, because they sidestep other religious beliefs
and are generally Christian in orientation, Baker's opinion said.
Furthermore, the ``method and context'' of the instruction would
have to be monitored, and that would be the job of local boards,
not the state board, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Brumby, the state school board chairman, said he thinks the
legal opinion raises concerns that confirm the board's wisdom in
seeking Baker's guidance in the first place. But what to do now
will have to wait until the board discusses this further on Dec. 9,
he said. Clearly, the courses can't be ruled legal until it is
determined how they are taught in the classroom, Brumby said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year at least two Georgia school systems _ Decatur
and McDuffie counties _ sought state funding for courses on the Old
Testament and the New Testament as history and literature based on
course outlines developed by the North Carolina-based National
Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools. Lee County also took
public comment on the proposed high school elective courses, but
did not take action.
</P>
<P>
   Only McDuffie County schools actually taught the course _ for
one day _ until the state school board postponed a decision, Brumby
said.
</P>
<P>
   A third proposed course that drew the same cautions from Baker
is ``Scientific and Religious Perspectives on Life and
Intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts can offer electives at their own expense,
such as drivers' education, but few do so. Local boards would face
the same legal risks that Baker outlined for the state.
</P>
<P>
   State school Superintendent Linda Schrenko has given support for
state funding of the courses. The attorney general's opinion cited
Schrenko's assurances that these particular courses have a secular
purpose _ one of three requirements set by the U.S. Supreme Court
for a faith-related matter to be legally supported by government.
But he said other experts could disagree with Schrenko's experts at
the Department of Education on this.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko could not be reached for comment Monday on Baker's
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Other state school board members interpreted the opinion in a
variety of ways. Cathy Henson said the warnings suggest to her that
it's safer to stay away from the Bible courses, especially since
courses in comparative religion are already offered in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But board member Bruce Jackson said the attorney general's
opinion doesn't resolve anything. He also said the issue is
designed to raise political controversy to help certain
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said of Schrenko and others: ``She's one of the
politicians who has something to gain from this; they get the
political mileage whether we approve it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   At last Thursday's board meeting, Sen. Tommie Williams (R-Lyons)
and Rep. Tommy Smith (D-Alma) presented a bill they said they would
introduce in January in support of state-funded Bible courses if
the board doesn't resolve the issue on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kintisch, a lawyer who runs the social-justice advocacy
agency called Center for Children and Education, said the problem
with Baker's opinion is that it did not analyze the specific
courses. The Fort Myers, Fla., school system was sued last year for
offering Bible-history classes presented by the organization that
created the courses the Georgia school districts sought to teach. A
settlement of the Florida case required that the New Testament
curriculum be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   While teaching religion in a devotional way may be
constitutionally risky, teaching about religion is viewed by the
courts and many educational experts as an important aspect of high
school education.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach U.S. history and world history without
teaching about religion,'' said Robbyn Greer, social studies
coordinator for Clayton County, Ga., schools. Greer taught a
state-funded course in Clayton County on the Bible as literature
more than 15 years ago. More recently, Greer taught in a
state-approved course the role of religion as it shaped American
history through the Pilgrims, the Puritans, the First and Second
Great Awakenings and the development of Methodism.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the instruction legal ``takes an awareness of whether
you're actually promoting religion or teaching about religion,''
Greer said. This is not as difficult as it might sound, regardless
of the teacher's personal convictions, because ``the role of a
teacher is to teach students to think, draw conclusions and
analyze,'' Greer said.

PROPOSED FEDERAL RULES TOUCH OFF DEBATE ABOUT REPETITIVE STRESS
INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ill., Ore.) (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Proposed new federal rules aimed at preventing
on-the-job injuries from repetitive motion touched off a
wide-ranging debate on Monday over how such injuries occur, what
they cost American businesses and what can be done to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as federal bans on sexual harassment in the workplace led
to years of training programs, lawsuits and arguments over
compensatory payments, the rules announced on Monday by Labor
Secretary Alexis M. Herman will generate thousands of claims and
counterclaims, labor and business groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges will focus on the definitions of injury, the extent
to which an employer can be blamed, and the vagueness of the
government's rules, both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions said on Monday that they would train their members
to recognize and report violations of new workplace rules intended
to prevent injuries resulting from repetitive motion, heavy
lifting, bending, twisting, pushing and pulling. And employers said
they would probably challenge the rules in court.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman unveiled the proposals on Monday and said the Clinton
administration would issue final rules, with the force of law,
before the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 27 million workers at 1.9 million work sites will be
protected by the standards, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules do not specify how much weight a worker may lift, nor
do they explicitly limit the number of hours that a person may work
at a computer. Instead, they require employers to follow certain
procedures intended to minimize workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Employers must, for example, respond promptly to all reports of
workplace injuries, analyze the risks of various jobs, change work
practices to reduce the hazards and provide free medical treatment
to employees who are injured.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of
Manufacturers and other business trade associations denounced the
rules as hopelessly vague. The chamber, which represents 3 million
businesses, said it would challenge the rules in court.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees
International Union, which represents 675,000 health care workers,
and Eric Frumin, health and safety director at the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, hailed the rules as
a major new protection for millions of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The unions said they would teach workers how to enforce their
rights under the new rules, issued by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OSHA standards have the potential to make a huge
difference in the day-to-day lives of working Americans,'' Frumin
said. ``We will expand our training programs on ergonomics. We'll
make sure workers know their rights, including the right to file
injury reports and the right to get their jobs fixed. We expect
thousands of workers to file complaints with employers and with
OSHA.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said his union would teach its local leaders how to use
the new standards in bargaining with nursing homes. In addition, he
said, the union will distribute pamphlets explaining the new rules
and will develop ``incident reporting forms,'' so hospital and
nursing home employees can report hazardous conditions and
violations of the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA, which regulates workplace safety, said the rules would
cost employers $4.2 billion a year. But the agency said that
employers would save $9 billion a year because workers would be
more productive, would suffer fewer injuries and would lose fewer
days of work. At the same time, it said, employers will spend less
money on workers' compensation, health insurance, the investigation
of injuries and the retraining of workers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Individual employers, especially large employers, said they had
already taken steps like those that would be required by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Golden, a spokesman for Deere &AMP; Co., the world's largest
manufacturer of farm equipment, said: ``We're in ergonomics for the
long haul because it's wise business. We've had an ergonomics
program since 1984. Eighty percent of the problems can be fixed for
$200 or less.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden said Deere's contract with the United Automobile Workers
provided for a full-time company-paid union member in every plant
to look for ergonomic problems and to suggest improvements. At the
Harvester plant in East Moline, Ill., Golden said, the company
found a way of raising and lowering parts that have to be welded
together, so the job is equally comfortable for a 6-foot-4 man on
one shift and a 5-foot-3 woman on another.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim M. Wordsworth, the owner of a restaurant and catering
business in McLean, Va., said the rules could have a ``devastating
impact'' on some small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, for example, that you go bowling every night and
develop a wrist problem,'' Worsworth said. ``Your job is to enter
data on a computer. The computer keyboard did not cause your
injury, but could aggravate it. In some circumstances, you could
then qualify for six months of paid leave, with 90 percent of your
wages and all of your benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, employers may be required to maintain pay and
benefits for workers who suffer debilitating injuries, if job
activities and work conditions are ``reasonably likely to cause or
contribute to the type of injury'' reported.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA made a few changes to mollify employers. But Republicans in
Congress said they would step up efforts to block the rules at
least until January 2001, when the National Academy of Sciences is
to issue a report assessing the evidence that work activities cause
injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who is chairman of the Committee
on Small Business, said, ``The rules are so vague that employers
will not be able to tell what they can or should do to protect
their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who is chairman of the Committee on
Education and the Work Force, said he was disappointed that OSHA
had issued the rules because ``there does not yet exist a consensus
on the causes and effects of musculoskeletal disorders in the
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Randel K. Johnson, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said: ``The rules would cost businesses billions of
dollars, but the benefits, if any, are uncertain. If OSHA goes
forward with these rules, we will challenge them in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, employers would generally have to adopt
ergonomics programs if even a few employees suffered
musculoskeletal disorders related to work. Federal officials
conceded that it might sometimes be difficult to know whether an
injury was caused by activities on or off the job.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government said an ergonomics program should include these
elements:
</P>
<P>
   _ Employees must have ways to report symptoms of musculoskeletal
disorders. Employers must respond promptly to such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers must inform employees of workplace hazards that may
cause musculoskeletal disorders. They must repeat the training once
every three years, or more frequently if additional injuries occur.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers must systematically analyze jobs to identify any
factors that may cause or aggravate musculoskeletal disorders.
Employers must eliminate the hazards or ``reduce them to the extent
feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In analyzing ``problem jobs,'' employers must consult workers
and solicit their advice on how to reduce the risks of injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers must provide workers with medical care needed to
treat their work-related injuries, at no cost to the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said employers could fix jobs by
redesigning work stations, modifying tools or equipment, changing
the pace of work or encouraging employees to take short breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The rules say that ``ergonomic risk factors'' include forceful
exertion, ``doing the same motion over and over again,'' using
power tools, ``sitting for a long time'' in the same position,
maintaining awkward posture, reaching below the knees or above the
shoulders to grasp objects, or bending or twisting the body while
lifting heavy objects.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are to be published in the Federal Register on
Tuesday. The Labor Department will accept written comments from the
public until Feb. 1, 2000. Department officials will hold public
hearings on the proposals on Feb. 22 in Washington, on March 21 in
Portland, Ore., and in Chicago on April 11.

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS RISE AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks continued their rapid ascent Monday
carrying the NASDAQ composite index to its 14th high close in the
last 17 sessions. Gains in Internet stocks and big companies like
Microsoft and Intel helped to fuel the advance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains in Nasdaq stocks, the other main stock gauges
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surprise to a lot of us to continue to see the market
act the way it is acting,'' said Ned Collins, head stock trader at
Daiwa Securities America. ``It continues to beat all
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Nasdaq composite index was up 23.31 points, to
3,392.56. Since the start of the month, the index has gained more
than 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Big gains in several old-line blue chips, including Coca-Cola,
AT&AMP;T and IBM, helped to push the Dow Jones industrial average up
85.63 points, to 11,089.52.
</P>
<P>
   But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.06 points,
to 1,420.94 and the Russell 2000 index of small companies dipped
half a point, to 460.77.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, a component of all three main market gauges, was the
biggest positive influence in Monday's session, traders said. The
stock jumped 4 3/16, to 90 3/16, after federal Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the government's antitrust
case against the company, named a mediator last week to try to help
reach an out-of-court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news from Microsoft is probably the most positive
corporate news out there,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst
at Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was brisk Monday, but is likely to slow as the
Thanksgiving holiday nears. The stock market will be closed on
Thursday and will be open for a half-day on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 873 million shares were traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. On the Nasdaq market, 1.2 billion shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was among the best-performing Dow stocks. The soft
drink giant jumped 4~ a share, to 65], after a Merrill Lynch
analyst issued a positive report on the company's prospects next
year and raised his rating on Coke shares.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was also a big winner, rising 5 7/16 a share, to 52. IBM
gained 4 1/16, to 108.
</P>
<P>
   Among Internet stocks, Exodus Communications jumped 17 3/16 a
share, to 118 3/16, after Exodus, which manages Internet sites for
other companies, announced a 2-for-1 stock split effective Dec. 14.
It is the third time the company has split its shares this year.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Arts rose 14 9/16, to 106 9/16, after the video-game
publisher said it had signed a deal to provide all content to
America Online's games site.
</P>
<P>
   A rise in long-term interest rates, prompted by a jump in spot
oil prices, did not help financial service stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter fell 1 9/16, to 122 13/16.
Citigroup dropped 1, to 55{. Chase Manhattan fell 1[ a share, to
81~.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in oil prices, though, did little to help big oil
company stocks. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an S&AMP;P component, fell
| a share, to 62}. Mobil declined 1 1/16, to 103~. BP Amoco lost 1,
to 59 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate effect of a sharply spiking oil price is
negative for the majors,'' Hogan said, ``because they hedge their
positions for a long ways into the future. Also, these companies
are much more diversified than they used to be. So it doesn't go
hand in glove that a spike in oil prices is good for the majors.''

IT'S A CLEANER SWEEPS THIS TIME AROUND

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's a pleasant surprise to this sweeps month, it's how
uncommonly sedate it has been. Heading into the final couple weeks
of this song and dance designed to boost ad rates and make local
television news look silly, we've had fewer embarrassments than
usual: not as many bloated miniseries and elaborate musicals as in
years past, and series haven't produced the high number of episodes
in which big-name guest stars are awkwardly written into scripts.
</P>
<P>
   The most thoroughly engaging production thus far has been the
continuing documentary series on the origins of New York, tucked
away on PBS, while the biggest phenomenon has undoubtedly been
ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the crazycool game show
that has trailed only ``ER'' in terms of audience numbers and ``One
Life to Live'' in the category of can't-miss addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Those who dismissed ``Millionaire's'' winning formula _ ordinary
people watching ordinary people win extraordinary amounts in a
question-answer format with music and Regis Philbin staring you in
the face _ have been proved wrong, to say the least. And there has
been an enormous jump among viewers who normally tune in to
syndicated game shows like ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy!,''
according to ABC research materials.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder this runaway ratings train became the first program
since 1983 to derail NBC's usually invincible Thursday-night
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Millionaire's'' success at luring viewers away from
fresh episodes of weekly favorites puts ABC into something of a
quandary, believe it or not. Knowing its power to lure, do you
bring it back at midseason as a daily or weekly series? Or do you
keep it shelved until sweeps, even though every other network plans
to have some kind of game show on the air by next season?
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that shameless Fox, which is being pummeled this
season in ratings for new series (none so far shows any signs of
longevity), will try its best to air its game show ``Greed'' daily,
since it's doing much better than anything the network has put on
in years. ___
</P>
<P>
   The big sweeps stunts now over, CBS appears to be the only
network with something left to show off as we wind down. Unless you
count NBC's ``Y2K'' _ and you shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The most-hyped show of the week, ``Y2K,'' on NBC Sunday night,
was the least enjoyable of the sweeps bunch. Ken Olin starred as a
government-employed systems expert who tries to outrace the bug as
it spreads. Part of that has to do with the fear that viewers will
actually become more panicked about what will happen at the stroke
of midnight. You have to wonder if the CBS publicity machine is
milking this for all it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting (not to be confused with ``best'') is CBS'
``Two Babies: Switched at Birth,'' (Wednesday at 8 CST), based on a
true incident. It airs following a Celine Dion concert, the first
of three consecutive evenings of hot-artist-on-the-road shows.
Gloria Estefan and 'N Sync also perform in the special, which
precedes Shania Twain's concert Thursday and Ricky Martin's on
Friday with Carlos Santana and Jose Feliciano checking in.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Switched at Birth,'' unlike ``Y2K,'' comes with an
underlining of truth. I have to say that ``Switched'' isn't a very
good movie, but it's certainly an intoxicating one. The teasing
question serving as its hook: What would you do if your baby was
switched with that of another family, and you didn't find out
until. ...?
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Gilbert and Rosanna Arquette star as the confused and
emotionally tortured mothers who each decide to keep the child
they've been raising. As you might expect, the decision brings up a
multitude of challenges that's only accelerated by the boyfriend of
one of the women. He's written as an insensitive, opportunistic
pest, and that's just one of the liberties producers took in a film
that's not based on but ``inspired by'' actual events. (I can
imagine the real-life families hating this movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember the story when it hit the news a few years
ago also know that one of the parties was killed in an automobile
accident, prompting the other side to go more aggressively after
the other.
</P>
<P>
   None of that dramatic friction happens here. Since ``Switched''
wants to be a cheery, feel-good movie, it ends on such a mushy and
unbelievable note you might want to skip it altogether. (The
ending, not the movie.) That's because sandwiched in between are a
number of scenes that are forthright and emotionally on-target in
the telling of two families seeking an unconventional solution to
their dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   I also like how the pendulum kept swinging to each side as to
who the bad guy would be. The movie separates the two by class _
Gilbert's well-to-do Gail Barlow calls Arquette's Linda Wells, a
struggling single mother, ``flaky'' and ``unworldly.'' Linda's
refusal to send her son to preschool and ``give him the social
skills he needs'' sends Gail through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's around his cousins all day,'' barks Linda. ``How much
socializing does he need?'' (To Gail, it was the ``right''
socialization.)
</P>
<P>
   To Linda, the Barlows are rich folks who ``think they own the
world.'' It's enough to give the movie a resonance of friction as
they try to come to a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switched'' is pieced together in true network movie form. It
moves too fast and often uses one line to explain important
matters, and although the movie is based on real events, the
characters are more or less written from some guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   But not once will you stop wondering exactly what you'd do in
each situation. The thought of waking up each morning looking in
the eyes of a child you love and will never let go but isn't yours
biologically, while knowing that your biological child is being
raised by others, has to be akin to psychological torture.

DOMESTIC ABUSE ARRESTS ON RISE, PARTICULARLY OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Defenders of battered women have long struggled to
persuade authorities to crack down on brutal men who reigned by the
fist at home and in recent years have largely won, but as laws and
the police have become more aggressive, they have produced an
unexpected consequence: in some places nationwide, one quarter or
more of arrests for domestic assault are not of men but of women.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among residents of Concord, N.H., who were arrested for domestic
assault this year, nearly 35 percent were women. In Boulder County,
Colo., one-quarter of defendants charged in domestic violence cases
through September were women. In Vermont, similarly, nearly
one-quarter of domestic assault arrests this year have been of
women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those are simple statistics. But little else about the
surprising arrest rate of women in some places is so clear, experts
say, except that it seems to have emerged as an unintended result
of ``mandatory arrest'' laws and tougher police rules meant to help
women who were the victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for battered women and many social scientists say that
most of the women arrested in these cases were acting in
self-defense, and to punish them is unjust and even dangerous
because victims will be unlikely to call the police again.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But other social scientists and the police say that the arrest
numbers reflect a real level of violence by women, even though
women cause far fewer injuries than men do, and the finer nets set
at women's urging to catch more domestic abuse naturally sweep up
some women as well.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1 million cases of ``intimate partner violence'' are
reported in America each year, according to the Department of
Justice, with female victims outnumbering males by more than five
to one. A different federal poll, called the National Violence
Against Women survey, which uses a smaller sample and different
methodology, found the gender gap was less pronounced: it estimated
last year that 1.5 million women and 835,000 men annually were
raped or assaulted by an intimate partner, a ratio of just under
two to one.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue of women's arrests sometimes takes on a gender-wars
edge. Some women's advocates see a backlash among predominantly
male police officers. Some men's advocates see a silent epidemic of
domestic abuse of men by women, and call the arrest numbers further
proof.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually no one claims to fully understand the phenomenon,
which mystifies because it diverges by such a wide margin from the
generally accepted estimate that 95 percent of batterers are men.
Officials say efforts are under way both to study the phenomenon
and improve training for the police, who must wade daily into ``he
said, she said'' battles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I could tell you what the cause of it is,'' said
Bonnie J. Campbell, director of the Violence Against Women Office,
which oversees the $1.6 billion allotted by Congress for five years
under the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. ``My instincts tell me
some of it is the need to fine-tune and do a lot of training. I
suspect one piece of it is backlash, but that's just my instinct.''
In addition, she noted, ``We are seeing numbers that suggest that
young women are getting more aggressive.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and advocates say that they are giving more attention
to the arrests of women. The high numbers have been cropping up for
years in spots, but lately, said Sue Osthoff, director of the
National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, ``it's
become a bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``I just think it's happening to more women in
more communities.''

   Head of child protection agency named
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Torpy
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes named a new director for Georgia's
child protection agency Monday, even as he announced support for an
advocate's office that would look over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Blount-Clark, 47, was heralded by the governor as an
``outsider'' who will ``look at the Division of Family and Children
Services with a fresh set of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important because her job is nothing less than a
thorough re-examination of its personnel and operations from the
ground up,'' Barnes said in introducing her.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said he will support legislation to create an
Office of Children's Advocate, an entity separate from DFACS with
``the power to investigate and intervene in cases at will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juanita will have a lot more success reforming the state's
foster care system if caseworkers and supervisors know that an
independent children's advocate is looking over their shoulders,''
he said. ``This job is simply too big for either someone on the
inside or someone on the outside to accomplish alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the advocate would have ``unfettered access'' to
case files, but the public still would not. Records of the agency's
cases are generally closed to the public, although state law allows
researchers to inspect the records if they can prove in court they
have a legitimate need.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he sees the advocate's position as ``an
independent inspector general with powers not dependent on the
commissioner (of the Department of Human Resources, which oversees
DFACS). It can advocate against the department if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the appointment had nothing to do with news coverage
on the circumstances preceding the beating death of Terrell
Peterson, although he referred to the 5-year-old boy in his
announcement. Terrell died in January 1998 despite eight previous
reports to DFACS that the boy or his siblings were being neglected
or abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envision an immediate shake-up,'' said Blount-Clark,
an 18-year Department of Public Health employee who heads The
Family Connection, a private-public agency that works to establish
local coalitions to help children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juanita is a relentlessly positive person and is undaunted by
the challenges that those kids face,'' said Russ Hardin, vice
president of the Whitehead Foundation, a private charitable agency
that has helped fund The Family Connection. ``Juanita has been the
Pied Piper of Family Connections, going all over the state working
with localities.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount-Clark will take over the department Dec. 16. Steve Love
will remain interim director until then.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes spokeswoman Joselyn Butler said the governor's office is
still trying to work out the details about the scope of the powers
and duties of the proposed advocate.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Georganna Sinkfield (D-Atlanta), who this year
introduced a bill for an ombudsman/advocate, said the new post must
have subpoena power to get records and to talk to children. It also
needs the ability ``to, if necessary, file suit against the agency
itself'' to force changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Georgia is serious, then you need an ombudsman with some
teeth,'' said Sinkfield, who chairs the House Children and Youth
Committee. ``You have to have some power or they'll get all sorts
of runaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Don Keenan, who is suing the state because of the
Terrell Peterson case, said he is ``deeply disappointed'' in
Barnes' choice to head DFACS and in how the child advocate would be
picked.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said Blount-Clark is ``someone who never criticized
DFACS, someone who is intimately knowledgeable with all the
personalities there. She is not a fresh face. She is no outsider.''
Barnes noted DHR Commissioner Audrey Horne is moving 171 budgeted
positions from welfare casework to child protection units in DFACS.
He said those workers must be retrained. The idea is to cut down on
the caseload and ease worker burnout, which is systemic.
</P>
<P>
   A state audit revealed the child protection section in Gwinnett
County had a 52 percent turnover rate in fiscal 1999. This turnover
rate, the audit stressed, has ``had a substantial impact on the
section's ability to complete their investigations in a timely
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount-Clark takes over an agency that also has been under fire
for miscalculating food stamp benefits. The state miscalculated $73
million in food stamp benefits last year and has exceeded the
national average for food stamp error for nine of the past 10
years. Georgia had drawn more than $9.7 million in food stamp
sanctions since 1986.

<P>
   National numbers on arrests of women in domestic violence cases
are hard to come by, but local numbers in some places do show a
rise. In Vermont, only 16 percent of domestic assault arrests in
1997 were of women, compared with 23 percent this year; similarly
arrests of women in Concord, N.H., rose to nearly 35 percent this
year, from 23 percent in 1993, the first year for which the police
had figures.
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, the police joined women's advocates and others this
summer to try to learn what was going on. But after examining 67
arrests of women for domestic assault, there was no single easy
answer, said the city's police chief, Bill Halacy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all these hypotheses, most of which didn't turn out to
be true,'' Halacy said. One theory was that the arrests might be
``dual arrests'' _ the arrest of both partners in a fight _ but
that was true in only 22 percent of the cases, Chief Halacy said.
Then, he said, ``We started looking at: `Is she a former victim and
this is like catch-up time?''' They found that 21 percent of the
defendants had earlier come to police attention as victims. And
among the victims, 16 percent had previously been defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the clear points that emerged, Halacy added, only three of
67 assault victims had to go to a hospital, where they were
examined and released, illustrating that violence by women causes
far less injury than violence by men. In 24 percent of cases,
Halacy said, both parties in the assault were women, including six
cases of mothers assaulted by their daughters.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grace Mattern, executive director of the New Hampshire Coalition
Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, said that some officers said
they needed ``better training on making that on-the-spot decision
on who's the primary aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed, Ms. Mattern said, that many of the women
arrested were involved in violent relationships that did not rise
to the level of battering. In classic battering, one partner seeks
to control and terrorize the other. In these cases, she said,
``when the couple gets angry, they push each other, they shove each
other, one slaps the other, but no one's a victim or a batterer.''
It's more a ``you hit me, I'm calling the police'' situation, she
said. Throwing things, shoving and hitting, ``in this day and age,
can get you arrested,'' she said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last two or three decades, there has been a growing
movement to defend battered women that has fought for tougher laws
concerning what many had long considered ``family matters.'' A more
recent wave of laws and policies has shifted the focus in some
places to identifying and arresting the ``primary aggressor,'' but
the upshot has remained the same: a great surge in domestic
violence arrests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that officers face a difficult task when they
enter a house where both partners are disheveled, bruised and
furious. Officials and experts emphasize that the police must have
the time, training and willingness to investigate thoroughly enough
to determine whether a woman is a victim or an abuser.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in some cases, said Bob Moyer, executive director of the
Family Violence Council of Lancaster County, Neb., an officer is
wont to say: ``I can't sort this out so I'm just going to arrest
both parties.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One Vermont woman described the process that led to her arrest
and conviction for assaulting her boyfriend this year. The man had
been beating her on and off for five years, she said, including
during her two pregnancies. After she got a restraining order, and
the man was warned not to hit her, he would smash her head into a
wall, or body-slam her, often in front of their small daughter, who
would lie on the floor and cry with her.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One night as she was being beaten, she said, she grabbed a knife
and cut an artery in the man's arm. The police took her in, she
said, but the man was not arrested. ``The police didn't look at
him,'' she said, ``didn't care about the violence he had done to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont officials say they are trying to determine why 23
percent of their domestic assault arrests are of women. Jeri
Martinez, an educator for the Vermont Network Against Domestic
Violence and Sexual Assault, said that a look at a few cases
indicated that women were largely being arrested for minor assaults
like scratching and slapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to look at this data and say women are beating
men,'' she said, ``but the data doesn't tell you that.'' There are
too many other variables, she said, like a recent expansion of the
law.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez was referring to people like Bert H. Hoff. Hoff,
who runs MenWeb, a men's issues Web site that has an extensive
collection of articles on battered men, said that the arrest
numbers were not surprising, considering various studies that
indicate widespread domestic violence by women against men. ``Men
are finally coming forward and are finally being believed,'' he
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murray A. Straus, a sociologist at the University of New
Hampshire whose research has shown high levels of domestic assaults
by women, said that to him, the arrest numbers show that ``the
pendulum is starting to swing back toward more equal treatment.''
It was terrible, he said, when men were getting away with beating
their wives, but then the emphasis ``swung to the other extreme''
when new laws and policies made it sound like only men could commit
domestic violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some wonder whether the pendulum has swung back too far.
Margaret Martin, an associate professor at Eastern Connecticut
State University who has looked at the Connecticut arrest rates,
blamed ``a kind of over-routinized enforcement of the law'' for the
fact that one-third of the state's domestic assault arrests are
arrests of both partners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As study of the numbers proceeds, so do attempts to improve
police training like one program recently begun in California,
where the state Justice Department reported that almost 17 percent
of domestic assault arrests in 1998 were of women.
</P>
<P>
   Alana Bowman, deputy city attorney of Los Angeles and the point
person on domestic violence, said, ``I think training is the key
component to allow law enforcement to see domestic violence in a
context'' _ a context, she said, that requires thorough
investigation to look for things like power and fear that may not
be immediately obvious.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State-level training, began this month, she said, but was
introduced in Los Angeles at the start of this year and has reduced
by one-third the arrests of women compared with last year. High
arrest rates of women, she said, seem to reflect confusion among
the police about new laws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eve Buzawa, a domestic violence expert at the University of
Massachusetts in Lowell, said that her research suggested that it
would also be wise to return more discretion to the police on whom
to arrest.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about community policing,'' she said, ``in
every other area they're trying to teach the police to use
discretion properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The high rate of arrests, particularly of women, raises a basic
policy question: Has the bar been set too low on domestic violence?
Should a couple that scuffles really be vulnerable to arrest?
</P>
<P>
   Chief Halacy of Concord said he had asked himself that question
and concluded that even if the violence was minor, ``Our hope is
that this takes on sort of the flavor that Driving While
Intoxicated did in years past _ that it's no longer socially
acceptable.'' &QL;

 &HT;    ON THE ROAD TO A LOST ERA OF AUTO TOURING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (t) travel categories for release
Sunday, Nov. 28.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are no cars or people in John Margolies'
nostalgic pictures of roadside America. The sun is always shining.
The sky is always blue. He even picks up any litter before clicking
the camera shutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is in my sunny little world,'' explained
Margolies, who has made an art out of chronicling tourism kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   But now the sun is setting.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the time when travelers could eat in a restaurant shaped
like a coffee pot and buy gas from a converted B-17 bomber and
visit Jesse James' hideout and park right beside the teepee where
they would spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Cars created this byways culture of neon and alligator farms and
eateries you entered through the mouth of a giant trout or the
label of a huge ketchup bottle. A few decades later, interstate
highways destroyed this grand, garish strip of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the interstates, getting there was half the fun,''
Margolies recollected. ``Now it's no fun at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun has been preserved, however, in Margolies' new exhibit,
``See the USA: Automobile Travel and the American Landscape,'' at
the National Building Museum. The collection illustrates how cars
opened the nation to a new sort of leisure travel and recounts the
resulting culture of gas, food, lodging and amusements.
</P>
<P>
   Margolies, who has written and illustrated several books about
his 25 years of exploring America, is guest curator. The exhibit
opened Nov. 19 and runs through May 7.
</P>
<P>
   The collection evokes a bygone era of auto travel through
photos, paintings, road maps, picture postcards, gas pumps, neon
signs, vintage Holiday Inn furniture, menus and assorted other
artifacts. A memorable history lesson is delivered through
Margolies' affection for the wacky and the tacky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like so-called bad taste better than so-called good taste
nearly all of the time,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit begins with a 1926 Ford Model T roadster. Such
mass-produced, affordable autos gave America a mobility unimagined
in the era of train travel.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, millions of families had cars and were eager ``to
explore their country in a new way,'' Margolies said as he escorted
a visitor on a tour of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   On the exhibit floor is a giant road map of 1939 America _ a
reproduction of an illustration from the New York Daily News. Of
course, the map is missing I-75 and I-95 and I-40 and all the other
interstate highways that now zip motorists across a homogenized
nation where identical McDonald's and Ramada Inns await at nearly
every exit.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans first set out to ``see the USA'' in their cars,
local entrepreneurs quickly responded with lodging, restaurants and
gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabin courts'' of miniature houses _ or teepees, igloos or
pyramids _ sprang up beside the highways leading into hundreds of
towns. Then came long buildings with carports connecting the rooms.
When business boomed, the carports were converted to more guest
quarters, and the modern motel was born.
</P>
<P>
   Margolies points to his picture of a ``No-Tel Motel'' neon sign.
The name was once common across the nation, he said, recalling a
clerk who boasted of renting the same room 15 times in one day. A
sign saying ``Tourists Only'' was ``road code'' for an
establishment that did not want this hot-sheets trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The curator pointed out a 1946 edition of ``The Green Book''
guide to motels where ``the Negro Motorist'' could stay in the
segregated South. ``Carry your Green Book with you,'' warns the
cover. ``You may need it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important'' to include this reminder that
``Welcome'' signs didn't apply to all, Margolies said.
</P>
<P>
   Like lodging, restaurants and gas stations along the roads have
evolved from quirky individualist establishments into predictable,
comfortable chains.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit shows early ``filling stations'' where the buildings
behind the pumps replicated flying saucers, dinosaurs or airplanes.
Meanwhile, hungry motorists could dine inside models of everything
from an apple to the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   The garish signs and weird buildings were designed to get the
kids yelling for dad to put on the brakes. The roadside businesses
``had to stop them in their tracks,'' said Margolies, hence the
orange roof on Howard Johnson's restaurants and the original
Holiday Inn signs ``modeled after a movie marquee.''
</P>
<P>
   Regretfully, Margolies said, he has stopped his travels. As his
beloved roadscapes disappeared, he said, ``I felt like a
photographic undertaker.''
</P>
<P>
   But visitors to Washington can still see the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is located in the National Building Museum, one of
the architectural treasures of the nation's capital. Compared to
the Smithsonian museums and traditional tourist stops such as the
Capitol and White House, the massive structure is rarely crowded.
Its Great Hall, with a central fountain and eight colossal
Corinthian columns, has been a popular site for presidential
inaugural balls since 1885.
</P>
<P>
   The building originally housed the Pension Bureau. Since 1985,
it has celebrated the culture of architecture, design, engineering,
construction and urban planning. The museum is located at 401 F
Street NW, near the Judiciary Square Metro station on the Red Line.
Admission is free.

   ``I thought it was important'' to include this reminder that
``Welcome'' signs didn't apply to all, Margolies said.
</P>
<P>
   Like lodging, restaurants and gas stations along the roads have
evolved from quirky individualist establishments into predictable,
comfortable chains.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit shows early ``filling stations'' where the buildings
behind the pumps replicated flying saucers, dinosaurs or airplanes.
Meanwhile, hungry motorists could dine inside models of everything
from an apple to the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   The garish signs and weird buildings were designed to get the
kids yelling for dad to put on the brakes. The roadside businesses
``had to stop them in their tracks,'' said Margolies, hence the
orange roof on Howard Johnson's restaurants and the original
Holiday Inn signs ``modeled after a movie marquee.''
</P>
<P>
   Regretfully, Margolies said, he has stopped his travels. As his
beloved roadscapes disappeared, he said, ``I felt like a
photographic undertaker.''
</P>
<P>
   But visitors to Washington can still see the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is located in the National Building Museum, one of
the architectural treasures of the nation's capital. Compared to
the Smithsonian museums and traditional tourist stops such as the
Capitol and White House, the massive structure is rarely crowded.
Its Great Hall, with a central fountain and eight colossal
Corinthian columns, has been a popular site for presidential
inaugural balls since 1885.
</P>
<P>
   The building originally housed the Pension Bureau. Since 1985,
it has celebrated the culture of architecture, design, engineering,
construction and urban planning. The museum is located at 401 F
Street NW, near the Judiciary Square Metro station on the Red Line.
Admission is free.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the most comprehensive survey ever conducted of
racial attitudes in the armed forces, the Pentagon has found that,
despite a decades-long effort to promote equal opportunity and good
race relations, wide gaps remain between how whites and minorities
perceive how they are treated.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of more than 40,000 uniformed members of the Army,
Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard also found that a large
proportion of military personnel had experienced what they
considered a racially offensive encounter, often from a superior in
the 12 months before the survey was taken.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 51 percent of those surveyed said that nothing was
done when a complaint was filed about a particularly bothersome
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 34 percent of whites and from 46 percent
to 56 percent of minorities said that many of these incidents
caused them to lose trust or have negative feelings about their
colleagues, a finding that could be particularly troubling to a
military that strives to promote cohesiveness and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's findings were a bit of a disappointment to current
and former Pentagon officials. The military, especially the Army,
has prided itself on doing more than perhaps any institution in the
country to foster a good racial climate and promote equal
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's efforts have drawn acclaim from some
academics and politicians, including President Clinton, who has
praised the military's efforts in the area of race relations and
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells us that even the military, which we still believe
is ahead of the rest of society, still has some racial tensions,''
said Edwin Dorn, former undersecretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, who commissioned the survey and has been briefed on its
findings. ``The results of this survey are not nearly as wonderful
as we might have liked. It gives a good sense of the kinds of
things that need to be worked on.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, the largest and most detailed effort to discern
racial attitudes ever undertaken by any U.S. institution _ military
or civilian _ generally painted an encouraging picture of race
relations, indicating that large majorities of military personnel
feel comfortable living and working around people of another race
and form close friendships across racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its findings indicate that the military has created a
much more tolerant racial climate than most other institutions in
American society, and that in many ways racial attitudes in the
armed forces are more tolerant than they are in the civilian world.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 82 percent of white members of the armed forces who
responded said they had a close personal friend who is black. In a
comprehensive poll taken in 1997 by the Gallup Organization, only
59 percent of whites reported having a close black friend.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the survey also found that
minorities, especially African Americans, tended to hold a more
pessimistic view than whites of race relations in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities also are more likely to say they have received a poor
evaluation because of their race or ethnicity, compared with
whites, and are more likely to believe that the armed forces has
paid ``too little'' attention to discrimination based on race or
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly telling was the fact that 17 percent of whites who
responded felt that the military did not pay enough attention to
the problem of race discrimination. In contrast, 38 percent of
Hispanic soldiers and 62 percent of black soldiers, sailors and air
force personnel said they felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials cautioned that further study of the survey's
findings was required before any solid conclusions or policy
recommendations were proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gave us initial answers,'' said William Leftwich III,
deputy assistant secretary of defense for equal opportunity. ``I
have to say these initial answers are not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the study, the Defense Manpower Data Center, a
Defense Department agency, sent out a 16-page form to 76,754
soldiers, sailors and aviators from September 1996 to February
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential forms were mailed to enlisted personnel and
officers up to the rank of captain in the Navy and Coast Guard and
its equivalent rank, colonel, in the Army, Air Force and Marines.
About 53 percent of the forms were returned in usable form, a
relatively high percentage for surveys returned by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was mandated by legislation pushed by Ronald
Dellums, a former Democratic representative from Berkeley, Calif.,
who was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The survey
is the first of a series of comprehensive studies on race relations
in the military. Pentagon researchers say they will be conducting
another survey next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the survey suggested that the military must still
grapple with racial issues, another report by the Pentagon
indicated that the armed forces had a mixed record when it came to
promoting minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Career Progression of Minority and Women
Officers,'' indicated that in 1997 minorities made up 15.3 percent
of all officers and women, 14.1 percent, up from 7 percent and 5.9
percent, respectively, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that while the promotion rates for white men
and white women were about the same, African-American men and women
were being promoted at a much lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials attribute the discrepancy in the promotion
rates to factors that were not necessarily related to race. For
example, minorities and women tended to be more heavily clustered
in administrative and support units in the military. These areas
tend not to provide the faster track for promotion that combat
units do. Also, Pentagon officials acknowledge that the military
does not do a good job of mentoring women and minority personnel
who show potential to become officers or move up the officer ranks.

HUGE GERMAN BUILDER NEARS BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE   with bailout talks failing;
Tuesday in lede cq.)  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Philipp Holzmann AG, the biggest
construction company in Germany, appeared headed toward bankruptcy
Tuesday after late-night talks brokered by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder failed to reach a compromise among banks trying to
arrange a $2.6 billion bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann has been on the brink of insolvency since last week,
when it said that it had suddenly uncovered $1.3 billion in soured
real estate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann's creditor banks had accused one another on Monday of
either covering up evidence of trouble or being inflexible in
coming to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor had raised some hope about a possible solution
Monday evening by arranging talks involving the banks and the
political leaders of the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is. That
move brought the creditors back into another round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   But early Tuesday, a Hesse government representative, Dirk Metz,
told journalists that the negotiations had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many banks didn't have the confidence in the concept of the
proposals that were put forward,'' Dow Jones Newswires quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted bailout of Holzmann highlighted the tattered state
of Germany Inc., the once tightly knit community of banks,
industrial companies and government officials that has
traditionally rescued ailing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, angry bankers said that Holzmann, which has lost
money for years, appeared to have concealed bad loans while
declaring that it was on the path to a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann's biggest shareholder, the Belgian holding company
Gavaert, contended that the big banks should have seen the problems
as well, and it threatened to sue them and the top managers of
Holzmann.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the finger-pointing, Holzmann's chief executive, Heinrich
Binder, gloomily confronted angry construction workers as a
bitterly cold snowstorm blanketed much of Frankfurt on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though he promised to do everything he could to keep the company
operating while in bankruptcy, Binder admitted that he ``cannot
say'' whether the company would be able to issue the next round of
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann has more than 1,200 construction sites around Germany,
and work stopped at many of them amid the bad weather and
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Because Holzmann is one of Germany's most venerable industrial
names and employs nearly 17,000 people, the banks had been under
heavy political pressure to prop it up one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, which owns 15 percent of Holzmann and holds more
than 2.2 billion marks, or $1.2 billion, in outstanding loans to
the company, had been leading the bailout and had offered to put up
about $830 million, roughly a third of what Holzmann said it
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks collapsed after a 15-hour meeting of creditors on
Sunday. Deutsche Bank said that ``inflexibility'' on the part of
Commerzbank AG, Germany's fourth-largest bank, had caused the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Commerzbank fired back, noting that Deutsche Bank should have
known better because one of its own top executives is chairman of
Holzmann's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of its problems was heightened Monday when rival
construction companies, including Hoch-Tief AG, asserted that they
had little interest in acquiring either all or part of Holzmann.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of Holzmann's problems is a huge portfolio of bad
real estate loans that it took on in the early 1990s, when the
reconstruction of eastern Germany was proceeding at a furious pace
and the industry was having an extraordinary boom. Besides
profiting from the construction work itself, Holzmann financed many
projects.
</P>
<P>
   When real estate prices in eastern Germany collapsed as a result
of overbuilding fueled by generous tax breaks, Holzmann found
itself with a growing amount of increasingly troublesome loans.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, Holzmann is required to file for bankruptcy as
soon as its creditors decide against refinancing its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Koch, the Christian Democratic premier of Hesse, had
reportedly put heavy pressure on publicly owned banks to contribute
money toward a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   According to some news reports Monday, the banks were short only
about 400 million marks of the 4.3 billion marks, or $2.3 billion,
that they were trying to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published by Bild Zeitung, Schroeder had said
that the banks had a responsibility to work out a rescue, adding
that he was convinced that the shortfall could be closed.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the talks on Monday evening had begun, Koch was
more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very difficult for Holzmann to stay alive,'' Koch
said.

 &HT;    Aikman, Marino given go-aheads for Thanksgiving game
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Miami and Dallas meet Thursday afternoon,
their future Hall of Fame quarterbacks will be calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman confirmed Monday that he is fit to play in the
critical Thanksgiving Day game at Texas Stadium. Nearly 2,000 miles
away, Dan Marino also was prepared to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and Marino provide an interesting subplot in a game
filled with interesting chapters. Aikman (two concussions) has
missed two games, and Marino (pinched nerve in his neck) is
returning from a five-game absence.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Dallas game has been hyped as Coach Jimmy Johnson's
first game at Texas Stadium since he and team owner Jerry Jones
parted ways after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy it's a short week because I won't have to hear as
many questions about it,'' Johnson said of his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, all attention shifted to a pair of quarterbacks who
have been missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he received medical advice from several physicians
in the last three weeks and concluded he has not had an
``inordinate'' amount of concussions. Aikman knows of eight
concussions in his college and pro careers, and does not consider
his return risky.
</P>
<P>
   He participated in a light workout Monday afternoon at Valley
Ranch, marking the first time he has taken the majority of snaps
since suffering concussions in consecutive games against
Indianapolis and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-game absence, Jason Garrett was 1-1 filling in
for Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The game arguably is more vital for Dallas (5-5) than Miami
(8-2). The Cowboys are 1-5 on the road and 4-0 at home. Miami has a
4-1 record with backup Damon Huard taking the snaps the past five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've missed Dan, without question,'' Johnson said. ``I'm
really happy with the way Damon has played overall. But after the
first week or two, I think it finally hit him how important he was.
He's going to be a good player for us, but he's not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dan is in the lineup, we can do some different things.
You want a mobile quarterback, but more than anything you want a
winning quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Marino's return will be a game-time decision, but
it appears certain he will start. Marino practiced Monday, a sign
he is ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, meanwhile, continue to baffle their fans by losing
second-half leads. They have led at halftime in nine of their 10
games and, in the other game, they had a 3-3 tie with the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   In their five losses, Dallas has blown leads of 7-3, 17-3, 17-0,
10-0 and 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   When Coach Chan Gailey was asked about the root of those blown
leads, he said, ``If I knew the answer to that, we'd get it
fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey nixed a theory that the Cowboys are poorly conditioned.
He cited the team's 21-point fourth-quarter comeback in the season
opener in Washington as proof that his players are physically
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey shook off criticism that the Cowboys abandoned their game
plan of using running Emmitt Smith extensively during Sunday's 13-9
loss at Arizona. Smith rushed for 127 yards, but carried the
football only twice in the pivotal third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In that span the Cowboys passed ineffectively and lost the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never please everybody, especially when you don't
win,'' the coach said. ``I still believe in keeping an offensive
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said injuries to safety George Teague (lacerated left
hand), cornerback Kevin Smith (strained right hamstring), receiver
Jason Tucker (sprained left big toe) and tackle Erik Williams (mild
concussion) likely will not prevent them from playing Thursday.

TENNESSEE TITANS SEE JEVON KEARSE AND THINK LAWRENCE TAYLOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Everything at shiny Adelphia Stadium is new,
especially the Tennessee Titans and their delirious fans. More than
66,000 gathered here on Sunday to see the Titans tackle Pittsburgh,
and one of their most enjoyable moments was when the song ``Le
Freak'' blared across the stadium. Children danced in the aisles.
Their parents offered a move, too. Blue and white posters were
waved celebrating ``The Freak,'' Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has a rookie in the National Football League created such
a stir.
</P>
<P>
   But Kearse has.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the Titans in sacks with 7{. According to numbers kept
by the Titans' coaches, he leads the defensive linemen and is
fourth on the team in tackles with 58, has forced a team-high six
fumbles and leads in tackles for losses with seven. His impact,
however, reaches far beyond numbers.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 foot 4 and 255 pounds, Kearse is an undersized defensive
end in weight, but in height, wingspan, speed, quickness and
agility he has few peers. His hands are huge _ he can hold the ends
of a 12-inch ruler in one hand, from little finger to thumb _ and
he wears size 14 shoes. He is easily the league's fastest defensive
lineman. He is tough and determined.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes of Tennessee's clash with Pittsburgh, it
was Kearse's sack of Kordell Stewart that helped ruin Pittsburgh's
potential game-winning drive. Tennessee won, 16-10, in a game in
which Kearse was nearly always double-teamed. He played the entire
game with a stomach virus, frequently vomiting on the sideline. No
matter. He was still dominating in a manner reminiscent of the Hall
of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents recognize that Kearse (pronounced curse) is a bit of a
freak of nature _ and an exciting player able to create chaos in
any offense. He has helped revamp the Tennessee defense and
affected the entire franchise _ Tennessee owns an 8-2 record now,
is 6-0 in its division and is 5-0 this season at Adelphia Coliseum.
The Titans appear playoff-bound for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   All of this from the 16th player selected in this year's draft.
There are certainly not 15 rookies currently better than Kearse,
who left Florida after his junior year and is now on pace to join
Al (Bubba) Baker as the only rookie defensive ends in league
history to earn Pro Bowl honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college at Florida, they started calling me Freak then and
it stuck,'' Kearse said. ``A lot of teams passed me up in the
draft, but Tennessee was smart. I came here expecting to come off
the bench and to get bumped around a bit. I expected the offensive
tackles to be 100 times greater than they were in college. But my
coaches tell me those guys can't block me and I've started to
believe it. I started out the season slow in my first couple of
games, but now I've begun figuring out what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates saw it from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In training camp there was a play where Chris Sanders, one of
our fastest players, ran a slant pattern from the receiver position
on the opposite side of the field,'' said Anthony Dorsett, a Titans
cornerback. ``Jevon was rushing the passer, was in the backfield,
turned and ran upfield and 30 yards downfield caught Chris and was
in on the tackle. We all said to ourselves, man _ that's why he's
the Freak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all think he can have the impact like a Lawrence Taylor,''
Dorsett added. ``Think about it; this is his first year, so he is
going off raw ability. Just wait until he gets some smarts. He fits
in the locker room because he is not a cocky guy, not one to brag.
You barely know he's here _ until you get out on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans move Kearse from left end to right end, keeping him
in constant motion so that offenses must always find No. 90 and
alter their blocking schemes to account for him. With his rare
ability to chase quarterbacks and ball carriers, even if Kearse
does not make the sack or tackle, he often creates opportunities
for teammates to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has never seen film of Bubba Baker, who was a rookie
with the Lions in 1978. He realizes that joining him in league
history would be special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would very much surprise me if that happened,'' Kearse said
of making the Pro Bowl. ``I didn't start out as hot as I am now,
but there are still six regular season games to go. When I'm in the
game, I feel like I'm going to get a ruckus started. I'm in a whole
different state of mind.''

 &HT;    Justice Department nixes recreation of siege, suggests
demonstrations instead
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Justice Department Monday opposed trying to
recreate the final day of the 1993 Branch Davidian siege in order
to determine if flashes seen on infrared video tapes are gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government suggested court-appointed experts
demonstrate what gunshots look like on FLIR (Forward Looking
Infrared) tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No attempt at 're-creation' of the events would meet the test
of reliability because it could not replicate and take into account
all the operative facts,'' read the government motion, filed by
Justice Department attorney Mary Louise Hagen. ``In short, it would
produce more confusion than clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   The government motion claims there are too many ``unknown
variables'' to recreate the conditions on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Such a re-creation would require, the government argued,
``precise weather information (including minute temperature
fluctuations); wind conditions (including speed and directional
shifts); the amount of moisture in the soil; the content and
location of debris generated when the gymnasium collapsed; all heat
sources (such as the tanks and the lights); and the relative
position of the heat sources, the debris, and the viewing
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell, the lead attorney in the wrongful
death lawsuit filed by surviving Davidians against the government,
derided the government's argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``They operated the FLIR camera for three weeks,'' Caddell said.
``Never once did it show any flashes other than from 11:20 a.m. to
12:10 p.m. on April 19, 1993. No flashes were seen on the FLIR
until tanks started knocking down buildings. None of it explains
why flashes were only seen in the back. Was the soil different in
the back? This is really silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we can recreate the conditions at Mount Carmel. ...
These are people talking like they know it will show gunfire, and
they're trying to come up with a way to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco last week
ordered the appointment of neutral experts to recreate the final
day at Mount Carmel, after receiving requests from both Special
Counsel John Danforth and plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs charge that flashes seen on the FBI's infrared video,
shot from a circling plane, are proof that FBI agents fired at the
Davidians, possibly preventing them from fleeing a burning Mount
Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have always maintained they didn't fire a single
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from sunlight to unexplained electrical anomalies
to now saying that the flashes on the FLIR are debris from the
collapsed gym _ which doesn't explain why you see flashes before
the gym collapses,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of recreating the conditions at Mount Carmel, the
government suggested Smith appoint a expert to determine whether
gunfire can be seen by FLIR technology within a specified spectral
(radiation) range (8-12 microns is the spectral range of the FBI's
sensors, according to the motion).
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's FLIR camera would not be needed for such a
demonstration, according to the motion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the motion, the government argues that the FLIR
camera used at Mount Carmel has been modified and recreating its
1993 state would be cost-prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``System modifications include changing from analog signal
processing elements, in the original system, to digital signal
processing electronics in the modified system,'' the government
motion said. ``... Digital systems have improved signal-to-noise
ratio, and are thus better able to discern weak signals, resulting
in a clearer picture. Thus, images recorded with the upgraded
equipment would not necessarily provide a reliable recreation of
the capability of the 1993 system.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said the FLIR camera used at
Mount Carmel was not commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you could go down to Office Depot and pick one
up,'' said Carole Florman. ``My understanding is that it's since
been upgraded. It's not like we shelved the older model. It's an
evolving piece of equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he'd like to see a re-creation of the final day at
Mount Carmel shot with the updated FLIR camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this camera with the upgrades shows gunfire that looks just
like the flashes from the 1993 film, how could anyone credibly
argue that's not gunfire in the FLIR tape?'' Caddell asked. ``To
say it wouldn't have shown up if the camera had not been upgraded
is just silly. You have to take the government's arguments to their
logical conclusion, and then they just fall apart.''

BRADLEY ATTACKS GORE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ In blunt language that echoed Republican
attacks against the fund-raising practices of the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign, former Sen. Bill Bradley sharply rebuked Vice President
Al Gore on Monday, asserting that the vice president has no
interest in changing the current campaign-finance system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those fund-raising practices, he said, raised ``questions about
where politics ended and government began.'' He said those
questions were reinforced by the vice president's use of White
House perquisites in his campaign against Bradley for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few people in Washington want the system changed,'' Bradley
told the crowd here at New Hampshire College. ``Nothing is changed
because it's in the interest of politicians not to change it. The
system works to help those who are in power keep that power. So why
should they rock the boat?''
</P>
<P>
   The speech, one of Bradley's strongest efforts yet to portray
himself as a political outsider and reformer, hit Gore at one of
his most vulnerable points, accusations of fund-raising
irregularities in 1996 that critics of the Clinton administration
thought deserved an investigation by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore responded to the speech by saying that Bradley was
a relative latecomer to campaign-finance reform, while Gore had
been sponsoring legislation in Congress to change the system as
early as 1979. They also said that while Bradley accuses others of
being beholden to special interests, he has taken numerous
contributions from bankers, lawyers and pharmaceutical companies,
as well as flights on corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been a fighter for campaign-finance reform since
his earliest days in Congress,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press
secretary. ``While Senator Bradley has chosen to talk about the
issue of campaign-finance reform, he fails to fully disclose who
paid for and is paying for the dozens of corporate flights Bradley
is using during this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In his attacks on fund-raising irregularities in the
Clinton-Gore campaign of 1996, Bradley risked offending many party
activists who contend that President Clinton had to push the
existing rules to keep pace with the Republicans fund-raising
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley may also anger loyal Democrats by raising an issue the
Republicans are likely to exploit if Gore is the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have already attacked Gore for appearing at a
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles and for making
fund-raising phone calls from his White House office. Attorney
General Janet Reno rejected demands that she appoint a special
prosecutor to investigate the accusations. Bradley did not mention
any specific practices from 1996 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The address was also unusually aggressive for Bradley, who has
said he is trying to avoid negative campaigning. Until now, Bradley
has tended to criticize the vice president in response to attacks
by Gore, particularly on health care issues. But the two
candidates' positions on campaign-finance reform are not very far
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said he wanted to invigorate his oratory on
Monday because of recent news reports that Gore has been using his
official trips as vice president to help his campaign. Bradley's
unexpectedly strong challenge has forced the vice president to
spend more than he had anticipated, particularly in the early
voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where there are strict
spending limits for the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign also contends that campaign finance, like
health care, provides a clear contrast in the two candidates'
styles, with Bradley taking bold positions while Gore pushes
half-way measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises the issues of what lessons the vice president
learned from the 1996 campaign,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's
director of communications. ``What Senator Bradley was suggesting
is that he didn't learn anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also clearly believes the issue resonates with voters in
New Hampshire, who are known for supporting reform-minded
politicians. The state's primary on Feb. 1 is the nation's first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The straight talk the people of New Hampshire value is
becoming so much more rare in Washington,'' Bradley said on Monday,
``because Washington is the capital of double talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has called for ending the unlimited contributions to
political parties known as soft money; for public financing of
House and Senate campaigns; for free broadcast time for
congressional candidates starting 60 days before the general
election, and for allowing voters to register on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said that if he was the Democratic nominee, he would
call on the party not to accept soft money if the Republican
candidate agreed to the same. Gore's campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho, has criticized that idea and only one Republican, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, has agreed to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also called for ending soft money, providing candidates
with free air time and for public financing of House and Senate
campaigns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley almost mockingly referred to a 1995
handshake agreement between President Clinton and then House
Speaker Newt Gingrich in Claremont, N.H. to appoint a commission to
revamp the campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is behind every public handshake, like the one in
Claremont on this issue, there has always been a secret
handshake,'' Bradley said. ``That tacit secret handshake signals an
agreement among politicians not to upset a system that they use to
their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   He said almost nothing had been accomplished by Congress this
year on issues like gun control, managed care reform and the
minimum wage because big-moneyed interests had stifled legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever wonder why Congress seems eager to act on issues like
accelerated depreciation?'' he asked. ``Or why we still have nearly
14 millions children in America who live in poverty while
corporations get major tax loopholes for themselves. Well, I think
money has something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley repeatedly referred to campaign-finance reform as a core
Democratic issue, suggesting that Gore had betrayed his party's
principles. And he likened the opposition to it to the opposition
to Social Security in the 1930s, to Medicare in the 1960s and to
the tax reform he sponsored in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians believe you don't really care about this issue,
campaign- finance reform,'' he continued. ``They don't respect you
enough to even hide their actions, or pretend.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CAN MARBURY SAVE HIMSELF AND `GAME'? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What has happened to the kid with the sparkle in his eyes and
the quick, engaging smile? Where is the 14-year-old Coney Island
prodigy who sat on the floor outside the Lincoln High School
gymnasium eight years ago and told a reporter that his life's
calling was so obvious to anyone who watched him play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a point guard,'' Stephon Marbury said. ``That's what I was
born to play.''
</P>
<P>
   His older brothers had elevated the family name in the Brooklyn
pantheon of guys with ``game'' but had not been blessed with the
intrinsic vision, the instinctive goods. From even before he was
the freshman leader of a city champion, Stephon Marbury was more
than a total talent. He was a team player, a guy who delivered. All
he needed then, all he would ever need, were the complementary
players to make him look good.
</P>
<P>
   This was reinforced whenever the playmaker-in-motion was ready
to make his next move: at Junior's Restaurant on Flatbush Avenue,
upon acceptance of a basketball scholarship to Georgia Tech. After
his first college season and last amateur game, when he confided
that ``I'm ready to run a pro team.'' And, finally, when _ on draft
night in the very arena he now, sadly, calls home _ he landed with
Minnesota to play with Kevin Garnett, who was then his good friend.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Marbury smartly contrasted himself with that year's
No. 1 pick, Allen Iverson. ``He's a scorer in a point guard's
body,'' he said. ``I make everyone else better.''
</P>
<P>
   To where has that mind-set, that player, disappeared? The
Marbury who sat at his dressing stall inside Continental Arena last
Saturday night after another distressing Nets defeat was a sullen
young man with evasive, untrusting eyes. He was dressed in black,
except for the logo of the sportswear company he represents, on his
sweatshirt and pants. A large silver crucifix dangled from his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   His team seemed without hope or prayer, headed west for a trip
that begins in Sacramento on Tuesday night. ``I never lost this
much in my life,'' Marbury said.
</P>
<P>
   He sat there, all of 22, certainly young enough to be getting
career counseling, but probably realizing _ subliminally, at least
_ that it was too late. When Marbury needed someone in Minneapolis
to advise him to get over his Garnett-contract envy, he got David
Falk offering visions of grandeur by the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Superagent, power broker, Falk was serving three clients at
once, Marbury, Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn. Falk wasn't about
to tell Marbury that somewhere along the road to riches he had
forgotten whom he had set out to be. He wasn't going to caution him
that he wouldn't find anyone in New Jersey nearly as good as
Garnett. He wasn't going to spell out the risks of a chaotic
franchise in a suburban market that often feels a thousand miles
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the voices of reason to help Marbury better deal with
the pervasive forces of self-interest? The point guard's mother
initially opposed the trade, but by late Saturday night, Mabel
Marbury was loudly giving people an idea of how Marbury may have
veered off track in the first place. ``You are a winner,'' she
said, deliberately within earshot of reporters. ``The other guys on
this team don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury apparently did not need the maternal lecture. He was
already distancing himself from this injury-depleted team when the
season was only two games old, the only Net of note who didn't show
up to meet President Clinton at a high school in Newark. In
berating his teammates to the point of alienation, he has too often
confused talent with effort. He has played hard but only to the
tune he alone is whistling.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly lit into his coaches Saturday night, forgetting
his own dismal and distracted performance, in being outclassed by
Iverson. The organization, heavily invested in him, makes excuse
after excuse for these eruptions, hoping for temporary relief to
avoid the unfortunate round of firings to come.
</P>
<P>
   If this unfolding drama sounds chillingly familiar, it is
because we already know of a mercurial but relentlessly unhappy
player who was cut so much slack that he finally snapped and went
too far in taking retaliatory matters into his own hands. Sad but
true: Latrell Sprewell's Golden State Warriors have much in common
with Stephon Marbury's New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to direct one's team, and quite another to run
everyone's life. Marbury forced this trade, and now he acts like a
victim of it. Here is the point the Nets better make to Marbury,
and soon: He is as much a victim in New Jersey as Sprewell was out
West.

`INVISIBLE UNIVERSE' COLORS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PERCEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
REVIEW OF: ``The Invisible Universe'' 
 By David Malin (Bullfinch, $50 until Dec. 31, $60 after)  
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Universe'' is a beautiful book of astronomical
photographs. It is the size, if not of a coffee table, at least of
a good-size end table. Inside are some of the most ravishing
pictures of the heavens that you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The book concentrates on deep-sky objects and nebulae, one photo
to a page, with text on the facing page explaining what we are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   There are rosy rings of hydrogen gas, blasting inconceivable
distances from a former supernova; there are sooty bags of black
dust blocking out bits of background glow; there are swirling
spiral galaxies twisting their way through the emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   All of it in a color as intense as an ``Arizona Highways''
magazine sunset. You cannot even browse through this book and not
come away with the feeling that the universe is heartbreakingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it raises some interesting issues concerning our
assumptions about our own perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised recently, in such places as
``Discover'' magazine, about the accuracy of the space photos we
love to gawk at. Many of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration pictures of the solar system _ and even the recently
celebrated ``Pillars of Creation'' photo of the Eagle Nebula in the
constellation Serpens _ are printed in an exaggerated false color.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are used diagrammatically. Imagine your high-school
class photo, for instance, in which all the students taller than 6
feet are colored blue, and all those under 5 feet are colored red,
with those in between colored yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Such a picture would not be an accurate representation of the
way the scene looked, but it would provide useful information to
someone who needed that information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the NASA photos are coded that way with the colors to
aid the scientists using them. It makes visible what is invisible
on a planet's surface _ like the winds of Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Such color is useful to astronomers interested in studying the
internal structure of the nebula, but creates a false impression of
what the phenomenon might look like to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Author David Malin, who took the photographs in ``The Invisible
Universe,'' is touchy on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color photographs reproduced here are the colors of
nature, too faint to be seen and too diluted to be captured on
color film, but real nonetheless,'' he writes in a technical note
concerning the difficulty of arriving at ``true'' color in
astronomical photography.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim begs the question: If the colors of nature are too
faint to be seen, how can he claim that they are the ``true
colors''? Are they the colors we would see if they weren't too
faint? But they ARE``'' faint. Then, what makes them real?
</P>
<P>
   I must assume that he means that they are the colors we would
see if the Earth were very close to them instead of very far away,
so that they would be brighter and we could actually see the
colors. But because they are far away, Malin is essentially
synthesizing what color he believes they would appear to be if we
could somehow UPS the solar system next door to the nebula.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that color vision, as it has developed in human
beings, is not quite what we all think it is. Color vision is a
complicated evolutionary development, and it evolved in a specific
ecological niche for a specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to get too technical here, but when a scientist
talks about color, he is usually talking about the spectrum. That
is, to him, light is a wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum.
A small portion of that full electromagnetic spectrum is visible to
humans as light. Red is at the longer-wavelength end and blue at
the shorter-wavelength end.
</P>
<P>
   But human vision doesn't react exactly to the discrete
wavelengths, but is in fact generated from three fuzzy points on
that spectrum and rebuilt in the brain to simulate the full
spectrum. Human vision is a miracle of generalizing from the
fragment to the whole.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, it is, in itself a version of ``false color.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Malin makes a leap of faith between the spectral colors he
captures on film and the regenerated synthesis of color inside the
brain and assumes they are equal.
</P>
<P>
   Red-violet, for instance (or more technically, magenta) does not
even exist as a wavelength. Yet we see it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Further, our eyes are only dimly sensitive to color. We see
black and white a great deal more acutely than we see color. And in
dim light, the black and white kicks in and the color tends to drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   That means that such incredibly dim deep-sky objects as nebulae
are seen by the human eye in the monochrome of low-light vision.
Nebulae have no color at all (or more precisely, we see them in a
blue-green monochrome, because that is how our brains are wired).
</P>
<P>
   So, the long time-exposure photographs make ``visible'' what is
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   All of which make Malin's claim of true color not a lie, but too
simple.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other problems, too. Film, even the black and
white film that Malin used to construct his color pictures, suffers
from something called reciprocity failure. That is, the sensitivity
of the film is distorted during long exposures and when taking
three photographs through three different color filters to
synthesize the color, the exposures must differ to accommodate the
filters and the reciprocity failure. This makes the result always
somewhat iffy.
</P>
<P>
   I raise all these issues not to denigrate Malin's book, which I
love, but to remind us once again that even such a simple
proposition as what the world _ and the universe _ ``look like'' is
not as settled as we think.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live our lives with the maxim, ``seeing is
believing,'' and we tend to be smug about the accuracy of our sense
data. Scientists can measure spectral color, but the color we see
is something different. It is purely subjective.
</P>
<P>
   And as with relativity and quantum mechanics, we don't notice
the discrepancies at the scale of our day-to-day lives, but when we
reach the very large and the very small, the assumptions of our
perceptions break down. And, if we have any sense, we shrivel in
humility. &QL;

<P>
   ``CRYING: THE NATURAL &AMP; CULTURAL HISTORY OF TEARS'' &QL; 
By Tom Lutz (Norton, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only humans sob. Weeping is a peculiarity of man _ no other
animals are known to do it. And yet we know surprisingly little
about it, other than the obvious (children cry more than adults do)
and the physiological (reflex tears _ those you produce when you
peel an onion _ have a different chemical composition from
emotional tears). Crying is an escape, a physical act that
distracts us from the trauma that has made us cry. It is also, Lutz
tells us, a kind of language, ``expressing not just our distress
but our demands, not just our desire to be understood but our
desire to evade detection. Our crocodile tears can be used to
ensnare, to confuse, to extort, to deceive. Even those tears we cry
when we are alone have an imagined audience. Even in our deepest
moments of grief, we can be well aware of the effect our tears are
having on those around us.'' This vastly researched,
interdisciplinary study of tears is a delight, in the tradition of
Diane Ackerman's ``A Natural History of the Senses.'' Lutz looks at
how philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists and sociologists
have interpreted tears over the years. He looks at crying in art
and literature, film and advertisement. He explores the physical
process of crying and its psychological benefits, as well as gender
issues that it raises (powerful women such as Hillary Rodham
Clinton do not cry in public because it could be read as weakness).
He discusses our changing attitudes toward tears, illustrated by
the fact that Edmund Muskie was run out of the 1972 presidential
primary race for crying in front of reporters, whereas Bob Dole,
who remained dry-eyed for the first 40 years of his public life,
cried many times over the past decade without consequence. Finally,
Lutz poses another puzzle: Even if we think we know why we cry, can
we explain why we stop? ``Tears,'' he writes, ``are the most
substantial and yet the most fleeting, the most obvious and yet the
most enigmatic proof of our emotional lives.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LADIES AUXILIARY'' &QL; 
By Tova Mirvis (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This compassionate first novel is the story of the women of an
Orthodox Jewish community in Memphis, Tenn., and their relationship
with a free-spirited woman _ a convert to Judaism _ who comes to
live among them. Batsheva is the widow of Benjamin Jacobs, who has
been killed in a car crash in New York. Hoping to ease her
loneliness and preserve her ties to him, Batsheva brings their
5-year-old daughter to the Memphis community in which Benjamin grew
up. From the start, it's obvious to the other women that Batsheva
does not fit in _ she does not cook or clean, nor does she pay
suitable attention to the modesty of her clothing or to the
dictates of Jewish tradition. But she does bring an understated
self-confidence, a passion for delving into the questions that
religious faith inspires, and a sympathy for the community's young
people, who crave freedom from the obligations to which they were
born. Mirvis tells her story in the collective voice of the Jewish
ladies, a ``we'' that reflects the depth of their traditions, the
vulnerability of those traditions in the modern world and the
oppressive standards that have grown up around them. Mirvis never
loses her compassion for these characters, nor does she ignore the
value of their moral and religious commitments. They are gossipy
and judgmental, yet oddly innocent. And in coming to terms with
their feelings about Batsheva, the women begin to question
themselves. This is a gentle story _ no sex, violence or overt
drama _ written with a deft hand and a sympathetic heart. Mirvis,
who grew up in the Memphis community on which her novel is based,
says her novel is ``emotionally autobiographical.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MISS MANNERS' GUIDE TO DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY''By Judith Martin
(Crown, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The formidable arbiter of taste and tactics turns her eyes to
the home front, where civility often meets the fate of a dead
goldfish. She begins, of course, with the ticklish affairs of the
people of the home front, known as ``The Family.'' This chapter is
so complex, given today's divorce and remarriage statistics, that
New &AMP; Notable had to take notes just to keep up. But Miss Manners
has everything under control. Other headings include ``The Help,''
``The Visitors'' and ``Entertaining the Relatives.'' Our favorite
parts are not Miss Manners' essays on these matters, but the
questions she receives from her gentle readers and the answers she
gives, in which she shows herself capable of gutting a cloddish
correspondent without even a trace of discourtesy. We love Miss
Manners, yes we do. We would suggest, however, that she has written
many books (12); that the overlap is conspicuous; that being
content with one's already considerable fortune is a gracious thing
indeed. &QL;

   Even Miss Manners would wring her hands over Rosemary Mahoney.
There is no civility in this memoir (now new in paperback) of the
summer of 1978, when the 17-year-old Mahoney worked as a domestic
for the woman she thought was her idol, Lillian Hellman. Hellman
was irascible, insulting, bossy, cheap and pathetic. Mahoney was a
teenager, and so not much more pleasant than her employer. The
difference is that Hellman is dead and Mahoney is alive to tell the
tale. Neither woman looks good, although it is Hellman who suffers
the indignity of having her 73-year-old body described through the
eyes of an angry young girl. This is what Miss Manners would
whisper in Rosemary Mahoney's ear: Someday, you will be old. &QL;

WIEDEN &AMP; KENNEDY WIN NIKE'S CONSOLIDATED U.S. ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The agency that created the signature theme ``Just do it'' for
Nike Inc. has done it again, regaining its status as the sole
agency for the Nike brand in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Nike decided unexpectedly Monday to consolidate its American
brand assignments, with billings estimated at $350 million, at
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which along with ``Just do it''
has produced some of the most familiar _ and most imitated _
campaigns in advertising the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's work for Nike athletic gear ranged from the jocular
teaming of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny to the sardonic dismissal
of silver medals from the Olympics as what you get when you ``lose
gold'' to the defiant presentation of a gallery of battered
athletes who proudly display their scars as the song ``You Are So
Beautiful'' plays in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation, effective immediately, is the most recent
twist in a tumultuous relationship between Nike and Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy that dates to April 1, 1982, when the agency opened with
the Nike account. Since March 1997, Wieden &AMP; Kennedy had shared the
Nike account with Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco,
the creative hot shop best known for the ``Got milk?'' campaign for
California milk processors that runs nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue had watched closely as Nike sought to respond to
challenges in its important athletic footwear and apparel markets
by shifting assignments between the two agencies. There has been
constant tension over how best to respond to the waxing and waning
of the appeal of the Nike ``swoosh'' logo and sneakers in general,
as evidenced by the brief life of a campaign last year by Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy carrying the theme ``I can'' in place of ``Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike never disclosed how the billings were being divided between
the two agencies in the United States; the company uses agencies
including Wieden &AMP; Kennedy for campaigns overseas. At one point
estimates were that Wieden &AMP; Kennedy had 55 to 60 percent of the
billings and Goodby, Silverstein had 40 to 45 percent, but lately
that division was thought to have tilted more in Wieden &AMP; Kennedy's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation as to whether Wieden &AMP; Kennedy or Goodby,
Silverstein would emerge on top in their tug of war _ as intense
and hard fought as any athletic competition featured in a Nike
campaign _ has been one of the agency industry's most persistent
and tantalizing guessing games.
</P>
<P>
   But the guessing ended Monday when Rob DeFlorio, U.S.
advertising director for Nike, met with executives at Goodby,
Silverstein in San Francisco to deliver word of the consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the work Goodby has done recently is excellent,''
said Scott Reames, a spokesman for Nike in Beaverton, Ore.
``Goodby's apparel ads and ads for the U.S. women's soccer team
really clicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt we needed to get back to one agency,'' he added,
``and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy is the agency we chose.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason, Reames said, was that ``we know them best
and they know us best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we couldn't be happier with the work we've been getting
from them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made the decision to split the business between two
agencies, there was a different business climate,'' Reames said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business climate has changed again, and we wanted to move
back to a one-agency model at the brand level,'' he added, ``and
when you do that, one agency has to be on the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Reames said the consolidation was unrelated to the arrival of a
new chief marketing officer at Nike, Ellen Turner, who had been
chief marketing officer at Kinko's, the office supplies retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation is a significant gain for Wieden &AMP; Kennedy
above and beyond the additional billings it will mean. As its
relationship with Nike became increasingly turbulent, Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy executives had looked to another big client, Microsoft, for
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft stunned Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in June by dismissing the
agency. Though Wieden &AMP; Kennedy has returned to the technology
category with another large client, AltaVista, and has been landing
plum dot-com accounts like Homegrocer.com, there was speculation
that the agency needed to regain its special partnership with Nike,
as the trade publication Adweek described the relationship last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got off the plane from Thailand and got this call,''
said Dan Wieden, president at Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, referring to the
word from Nike. ``I'm still in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels terrific,'' he added. ``In some ways it's easier to
share, but everyone is more than ready to take on the added
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief period in the mid-1980s when Nike moved the
American brand work to Chiat/Day, Wieden &AMP; Kennedy has always
worked for Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never won or kept business based on an ability to
smooth clients over,'' Wieden said. ``Anything that has happened to
us is based on the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm very proud of the work we've done over the last
year,'' he added. ``It's very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there have been too many ups and downs in what he
characterized as the long, deep relationship between the agency and
Nike, Wieden laughed, comparing the peaks and valleys to ``my
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   At Goodby, Silverstein, which is owned by the Omnicom Group, the
loss was being taken philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a good thing in some ways for everyone
involved,'' said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and creative director at
Goodby, Silverstein with Rich Silverstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike will get the undivided time and attention of Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy,'' he added, ``and there'll be financial savings'' from
using one agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, we've always been something of a minority
partner,'' Goodby said, ``and there's a lot of justifiably loyal
Wieden people at Nike.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodby acknowledged that executives at his agency sometimes
found it ``very difficult to work together'' with Nike management.
At one point last spring, Goodby, Silverstein had been poised to
resign its portion of the account, which included apparel, ads
aimed at women and specialty products like skateboarding shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs are not expected at Goodby, Silverstein, Goodby said,
because ``we're fine; we have more than enough to do.'' He listed
recent account gains like Discover Card, a unit of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, as well as additional assignments from clients like
Anheuser-Busch and Hewlett-Packard and the growth of the
E(asterisk)Trade Group account.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of the familiar ad slogan, ``When it rains, it
pours,'' Wieden &AMP; Kennedy also landed a new client Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Konami Corp. of America in Buffalo Grove, Ill., which sells
video games, awarded its account to Wieden &AMP; Kennedy's New York
office. Billings were estimated at $5 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   That decision came after a two-month review that had been
narrowed to Wieden &AMP; Kennedy and two other finalists. One was the
incumbent, G Whiz in New York, the unit of Grey Advertising thatlizes in advertising aimed at children. The identity of the
third finalist was not disclosed. Konami is part of the Konami
Industry &UR;  &LR; Co..

IRAQ CUTS OIL EXPORTS THAT PAY FOR FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: An expanded version of this story will be sent by 10 p.m.
ET.) 
(lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Losing allies at the Security Council, Iraq on
Monday unexpectedly began to cut off exports of the oil it sells to
pay for food for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The sales are permitted under a specially regulated U.N. program
meant to alleviate the suffering of ordinary Iraqis under
long-lasting economic sanctions. The sanctions have punished
Baghdad for not showing it has eliminated weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq fails to carry out the food program, ``it will be
thumbing its nose at the international community again,'' said
James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis said they were protesting the Security Council's
decision last week to extend the program for only two weeks,
instead of the normal six months. The short-term extension was
decided on when members of the Security Council reached an impasse
on whether to change the terms of the program to benefit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and officials said that the Iraqi move was not
clearly understandable, but that Iraq has repeatedly created crises
when events were not moving in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   While actions by the secretive government are rarely fully
explained and officials at the United Nations have become
accustomed to waiting for Iraqi policy changes to play themselves
out. Initial impressions late Monday were that the decision to stop
exporting oil was a temporary step, but one that could hurt Iraq's
reputation further.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said, ``Every time that Iraq shows its contempt for the
world, and its contempts for the world's concern about the people
of Iraq, it only makes it harder for Iraq's positions to be taken
seriously in the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said that independent oil
experts who oversee exports from Iraq reported Monday morning that
the Iraqis had cut the flow of oil to the Turkish port of Ceyhan
and were preparing to stop shipments from the Iraqi port of Mina al
Bakr on Tuesday. There are no other major export points.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, crude-oil prices rose in the New York market to over
$27 a barrel, a nine-year high. Iraq had been trading about 5
percent of the oil sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Saddam Hussein has told officials
that it will not sign a new agreement to continue the program,
which in the last six months earned more than $7 billion. The
program was intended to relieve the hardships suffered by the Iraqi
population because of nearly a decade of international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats looking for ways to explain Iraq's step on Monday say
that the Iraqis may see their support in the Security Council
eroding.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to reinstitute a disarmament program and send
inspectors back to Iraq after a year during which President Saddam
Hussein has been free of on-the-ground arms surveillance, the five
permanent council members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States _ have been working almost nonstop on a compromise
that will allow Russia, Iraq's strongest ally on the council, to
support a new plan, or at least not veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say that the Iraqis may have been stunned by
reports that the Russians had informally offered the United States
a deal during the recent European security summit meeting in
Istanbul, Turkey, that would have softened Russian opposition to a
Western resolution on Iraq in return for U.S. restraint in
criticizing Moscow's war in Chechnya. The Russians deny that such
an offer was made.
</P>
<P>
   France, which at times has argued in favor of Iraq, is now
considered to be part of the consensus behind a resolution that
would demand that Iraq accept and cooperate with arms inspectors in
return for a suspension _ not a final lifting _ of sanctions for
renewable periods.
</P>
<P>
   The French say they are concerned that Iraq, with a record of
secret prohibited arms programs, is not being monitored. France is
now expected to back the new inspection system being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has said repeatedly that it will not accept any inspection
system that does not lift sanctions first. The Iraqi government,
which has long chafed under the close monitoring and tight
financial controls of the ``oil for food'' program, may also be
holding it hostage at a critical moment to win concessions on both
plans.

Ponzi scheme, a scam in which early investors are paid with money

of the world and the media, that he earned his place in criminal

Sheriff Cone P. Blake and Charles Ponzi, right, arrive at the
courthouse after Ponzi had completed arrangements for bail. Ponzi
did something few other criminals could manage: He got his name
attached to his crime. Ponzi, who fleeced Bostonians out of
millions in 1920, did not invent what has come to be known as a
Ponzi scheme, a scam in which early investors are paid with money
from new investors. The con had been around for years. But Ponzi
did it on such a grand scale, with such flair and in such full view
of the world and the media, that he earned his place in criminal
history. (Boston Globe Photo)

   TALKS TO AVERT BANKRUPTCY AT GERMAN COMPANY FAIL
</P>
<P>
   Philipp Holzmann, the biggest construction company in Germany,
appeared headed toward bankruptcy after late-night talks brokered
by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder failed to reach a compromise among
banks trying to arrange a $2.6 billion bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann has been on the brink of insolvency since last week,
when it said it had suddenly uncovered $1.3 billion in soured real
estate loans. The German chancellor had raised some optimism of a
solution by arranging talks among the banks and political leaders,
but negotiations collapsed.

   OLIVETTI MOVE CHEERS INVESTORS
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Telecom Italia and the companies that acquired it last
spring climbed after a decision to abandon a plan to strip the
company, Italy's biggest phone provider, of its profitable cellular
phone unit. Analysts said that while investors appeared pleased
with the decision, they would not be fully reassured until Roberto
Colaninno, the chief executive of Olivetti, which used its Tecnost
subsidiary to take control of Telecom Italia in a $34 billion
takeover in May, gave more details of alternative strategies.

   DEBATE OVER WORKPLACE INJURIES
</P>
<P>
   Proposed federal rules aimed at preventing on-the-job injuries
from repetitive motion touched off a wide-ranging debate over how
such injuries occur, what they cost businesses and what can be done
to avoid them.

   SBC TAKES 43 PERCENT STAKE IN PRODIGY
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications, the regional telephone company, said that it
would transfer all of its residential Internet customers to Prodigy
Communications, the online service that has long been overshadowed
by America Online, in return for a 43 percent stake in Prodigy
worth about $900 million.

   NASDAQ ADVANCES TO RECORD AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks continued their rapid ascent as the NASDAQ
composite index rose to its 14th high close in the last 17
sessions. The other main stock gauges were mixed. NASDAQ rose 23.31
points, to 3,392.56. The Dow Jones industrial average increased
85.63 points, to 11,089.52. But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index slipped 1.06 points, to 1,420.94.

   MICROSOFT STOCK RISES DESPITE SUITS
</P>
<P>
   A growing wave of private lawsuits against Microsoft, including
a class-action suit filed in a state court in San Francisco, has
the company fighting on several legal fronts at once, raising the
stakes in its antitrust battle in Washington and intensifying
pressure on Microsoft to settle with the Justice Department.
Indeed, the appointment of a mediator and a prospect for a
Microsoft settlement offset any concern by investors that Microsoft
might get swamped by lawsuits. Shares of the company rose $4.1875,
to $90.1875.

 &HT;    'Choose Life' license plates violate constitution, NOW, rabbi
claims
 &HT;    By John Pacenti
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A former lawmaker, who is also the son
of a rabbi, is teaming with the National Organization for Women to
thwart the state's imminent sale of the ``Choose Life'' license
plate, saying it promotes a blatantly unconstitutional
anti-abortion slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The group's game plan: Use the Bible to ``turn the tables'' on
the religious right's own arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush and his Cabinet will decide today whether to give
the final approval to a minor color tweaking of the plate's design.
If approved, the Department of Motor Vehicles and Highways will
start pressing about 15,000 tags, which will be available in
January for an extra $22 to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The bright yellow plate has child-like crayon drawings of
children's faces with ``Choose Life'' scrawled on top _ a phrase
long associated with opposing abortion. NOW hopes to stop the plate
before it starts showing up at county comptroller offices and tag
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The organization will seek an injunction in Palm Beach County
Circuit Court by Friday, Boca Raton attorney and former Democratic
state Rep. Barry Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   The tag violates the U.S. Constitution and actually misuses
theology for political gain, said Silver, a one-term Democrat and
son of a rabbi. The state is embracing a slogan of a sometimes
violent movement, in which doctors who perform abortions have been
shot and their clinics bombed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By creating the license plate, the state of Florida has placed
its imprimatur upon a religious motto which has frequently been
used to harass, intimidate and at times kill and maim those who
seek to exercise their rights, including the right to choose
abortion,'' according to the complaint obtained in advance by The
Palm Beach Post.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the license plate mocked NOW's 11th-hour plans,
and the sponsor of the state law creating the plate that passed the
legislature earlier this year said he was extremely disappointed
that the organization failed to get the point that the tag is
``pro-adoption'' not ``anti-abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who attack this, I think, need to get a life _ no pun
intended,'' said Sen. Jim Sebesta, R-St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he will ``turn the tables'' on the religious right
by using the Bible as part of his argument, saying that ``Choose
Life'' is a phrase that appears in Deuteronomy 30:19. He said it is
inappropriate for a biblical message to be used by the government
to support a divisive political issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida supports and endorses a motto which advances
religion,'' Silver said. The plate's supporters ``are using the
Bible to deceive.''
</P>
<P>
   Also expect an argument from Exodus 21:22 that stipulates
punishment for certain crimes: a life for a life, but a fine if a
fetus is killed. ``The Bible is clearly pro-choice,'' said Silver,
who plans to run again next year for the legislature. ``There is
not one word restricting abortion in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver's interpretation is a stretch of the intent of the
wording, said Dana Bible, associate professor of philosophy at Palm
Beach Atlantic College.
</P>
<P>
   While the word ``fine'' does appear in many translations of the
Scriptures, he said, ``To me, the argument made from that is the
Hebrews had a different understanding of the value of an unborn
child to that of a living person.'' Nonetheless, there was a value
and there was a penalty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has been courting Planned Parenthood Inc. and the
American Jewish Congress to join in the complaint as well.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cabinet vote approached, NOW was lobbying certain
members, such as Attorney General Bob Butterworth. ``We hope the
Cabinet will apply some pressure and re-think the situation and do
what's best in Florida,'' said Toni Van Pelt, president of NOW's
Florida chapter. ``If not, then we will follow (Silver's) advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Cabinet says no _ something it has never done on a
specialty plate _ it would simply mean a redesign because the
Legislature already has approved the tag.
</P>
<P>
   If NOW's injunction succeeds, it will be yet another setback for
supporters of the plate. Two years ago, Democratic Gov. Lawton
Chiles vetoed it, but this year his Republican successor signed it.
Van Pelt said Bush wants to divide Floridians by supporting such
nonsensical issues.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Silver's plans, the Marion County commissioner who
designed the plate, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to do something to justify their existence,'' said
Randy Harris, executive director of Choose Life Inc. in Ocala.
``The problem that organizations like Planned Parenthood have with
our license tag is that it can't receive any funds ... This is
pretty frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is an issue. According to the complaint, money generated
from the plate will go only to ``agencies which will never refer a
woman to an abortion facility, even if the pregnancy is a result of
rape or incest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These clinics don't give family planning and explain full
reproductive rights to women,'' Van Pelt said. ``They lay guilt
trips on them if they consider to choose abortion. A lot of times
churches run these clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Harris thinks the effort will fail, already an
Orlando obstetrician-gynecologist, in a separate complaint, has
forced an injunction on another abortion-related law signed by
Bush: one that requires 48-hour parental notification for minors
who get abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also has been victorious on such issues. In 1997, he
obtained an injunction blocking a state law that required doctors
to provide a checklist of information to those seeking abortions.
The courts eventually struck the law down, ruling it was designed
to obstruct a woman's right to abortion, which was upheld by the
U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   If Silver's battle heads to the courts it will most likely come
down to whether the plate violates the separation of church and
state or is, as supporters claim, simply a pro-adoption message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is an attempt to interfere with a woman's right
to choose, and we know that they don't really mean that they just
want folks to adopt children. They are doing it just to control
women,'' Van Pelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Sebesta has said that for the license plate to be effective, the
phrase ``Choose Life'' must be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sponsored this law because I can see this happening,'' the
lawmaker said. ``A young 16- or 17-year-old pregnant girl, with a
lot of peer pressure to have an abortion but in her heart doesn't
want one, is driving down the road. She stops at a red light and
the car in front of her has a ``Choose Life'' license plate, and
she realizes she is not alone, that there is an option.''

 &HT;    Receiver corps pulling for White
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The notion of Kelly Campbell lining up without his
running mate, Dez White, doesn't set well with Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Just the thought of White, who suffered a pulled hamstring at
Wake Forest, not being able to answer the bell for Saturday's
regular-season-ending clash with rival Georgia sends chills
throughout The Flats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an All-America-type receiver not in the offense,
you are going to miss him,'' Stan Hixon, the Yellow Jackets'
receivers coach said Monday. ``You have to.''
</P>
<P>
   White is listed as day-to-day, and Hixon said the junior from
Jacksonville expects to play against a young Bulldogs secondary
which has been reshuffled after being torched by Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a sophomore from Mays High, entered the Wake game with
58 receptions for 964 yards and nine touchdowns. But without White
to attract defensive attention, the Deacons held Campbell to five
catches for 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   However, Campbell did set the Tech single-season record for
yards, and has 1,013. He needs two more catches and a touchdown to
set Yellow Jackets marks in those categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dez had an excellent year last year, and we knew that Dez was
going to be double-covered a lot this year,'' Campbell said. ``We
needed other receivers to come forward and make big plays in order
to spread out and help the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But with White out of the mix, the dynamics change.
</P>
<P>
   White went down early in the first quarter against the Demon
Deacons after being hit while on punt coverage and never returned.
By the time Tech got on track, it was too little, too late and Wake
stunned the defending ACC co-champs 26-23.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, No. 20 Tech (7-3) tumbled out of Bowl
Championship Series contention, leaving the grudge match with the
Bulldogs (7-3) at Bobby Dodd Stadium as the final shot at saving
face in a season that began with so much promise.
</P>
<P>
   While White's absence was not the sole reason for the Jackets'
collapse, an already potent Deacons defense was able to double-up
on Campbell, playing a zone defense which denied the long ball and
forced quarterback Joe Hamilton to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you missed Dez, but you have to have other players
step up,'' Hixon said. ``Missing him is one thing, but this gives
some other players an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Wake, Kerry Watkins was his normal steady self. The
redshirt freshman from LaPlace, La., had six catches for 90 yards.
White's backups, freshman Will Glover and junior Brett Basquin had
the games of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Glover delivered on the promise he has shown in practice,
catching two passes for 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Basquin _ who broke his foot in the preseason and
returned two games ago _ grabbed the first three passes of his
career, including a 25-yard fourth-quarter touchdown that pulled
the Jackets within 26-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our receivers have to make plays for us to win,'' Hixon said.
``That's always our goal. And we have a big-play man in Kelly
Campbell.''

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Four days after the Texas A&AMP;M campus was thrown
into a state of shock when the Aggie Bonfire collapsed and 12 young
people lost their lives, the football team resumed preparations
Monday for its game against Texas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The players were trying their best to concentrate on football,
but their mood before practice remained somber. Many talked of
wanting to honor the memory of the deceased with a win over
archrival Texas, but they realized the tragedy is not going to be
washed away by anything that happens at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that's going to be looming around this
campus and this city for a long, long time,'' said offensive guard
Chris Valletta. ``It's definitely something that we're thinking
about. As far as football practices and things like that getting
back to normal, yeah, but even when we're out there we're always
thinking about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggies coach R.C. Slocum gave the players Sunday off to spend
time with their families and friends, giving them an extra day to
deal with the tragedy. For his part, Slocum wasn't sure what to
expect when the Aggies play the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are conditioned to believe that it's only old
people that die,'' said Slocum. ``When something like this happens,
it's shocking to them. Here are people they see around campus,
people like them, and all of a sudden they are no longer here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something they're going to quickly forget. The
whole campus has been engulfed in the sadness, the sorrow. The
players are a part of this family. I really don't know what it will
be like Friday. I've had people tell me they don't even know what
the crowd in the stands will be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that once the ball is kicked, it'll be football as
usual. I think that will be a positive thing for everybody
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies canceled practice Thursday and Friday and had a brief
workout Saturday. Slocum thought it would be best to give the
players Sunday off, but he expected they would be ready to resume
preparations for a game that has taken on deeper meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to come back ready to focus on the challenge of
the game and the responsibility we have because of the tradition,''
said Slocum. ``That's what the whole Bonfire was all about. It
wouldn't make sense for us not to focus on getting ready for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way we can honor these students who were victims is
to take seriously our obligation to prepare well and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Valletta and guard Semisi Heimuli, two of the Aggies who took
part in rescue efforts after the Bonfire collapse Thursday, both
had a sense of becoming closer to the student body in the period
since the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we weren't out there (at the Bonfire site)
as football players,'' said Valletta. ``We were out there as
students of this university. We realized they needed help, so we
all took off and went out there. So many people came together that
day, it was unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing made Texas A&AMP;M real to me for the first time.
The spirit of this place is just unbelievable. For the first time,
I really know what it means to be a Texas A&AMP;M student.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Heimuli, one of the first players to arrive on the scene:
``Everybody was coming up to us thanking us for being out there and
helping. I felt that was the only place we should have been. We had
to be out there. We had to do whatever we could to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I feel we owe the school a win. A lot of guys might not
feel up to it, but we owe everybody a win over Texas. We've got to
deal with playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior wide receiver Matt Bumgardner wants to put his focus on
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very weird week _ that's the word that keeps
coming back to me,'' said Bumgardner. ``This is such a tragedy, and
it's not just a natural tragedy. People were working on such a
great tradition, and it's all about football. This game is always
large, but after everything that's happened, it's almost hard to
talk about. Nobody knows how it's going to affect the players
getting ready. You've got to push on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first day we came out (to practice) Saturday, our minds
weren't there. After thinking about something so much, it has an
effect on you whether you think it does or not. We made a lot of
mental mistakes. I think with each day, we'll get more and more
into playing football. You don't want to say, `Yeah, we're doing
this for them.' But it is in the back of everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people were out there for us. No matter if the guys say
that or not, it's in the back of everyone's head, so it's
definitely going to have an effect on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior cornerback Jason Webster spent his time off Sunday
reflecting and praying for the victims and their families. Webster,
one of the team's leaders, seemed Monday to be emotionally caught
up in the tragedy and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' said Webster. ``I look at those lives lost,
and I'm wondering if on that day they had any thought in their
minds about death _ I'm sure they didn't. It makes me realize how
precious life is. We all take life for granted. I have so much
compassion for their families, especially this time of the year,
Thanksgiving. I look and see my parents being in the position that
those parents are in, and it brings a lot of sorrow to my heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that everything happens for a reason. I just don't know
what this reason is, and I'm not trying to figure out what it is. I
just pray for their families and for the souls that were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   During team meetings since last week's tragedy, Slocum said he
has stressed to the players that dealing with life's problems is
part of the maturation process. In no uncertain terms, Slocum told
the players they will have to face up to sadness throughout their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we tell them is that it's not the bad things
in life that happen to you that's important, it's how you react to
them,'' said Slocum. ``I told them that for the rest of their lives
they're going to have to deal with the emotions they were feeling
right now. It's inescapable. This is a reality of life that we all
have to deal with. As a young person, that's a little bit
startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you leave home, that may be the last time you see
your mom, or your little sister, or your big brother. You need to
live life like that. You base your actions on the reality that life
is very fragile. You try to put some meaning into this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got kids grappling with what's going on, and you try to
explain that this is the way it works. You have to deal with it.
Life has to go on. You can't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies are getting ready for their game against Texas, but
to a man they know they will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed basically everything about all of us, I think,''
said Valletta. ``I don't think any person can say they haven't been
affected by this. It puts life in perspective. People my age, 21 or
22 years old, we have this attitude of invincibility. You don't
think things like this could happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you see fellow students in this tragedy, it shows no
one can control their own destiny. Football is a game, and a lot of
people think it's important, but it's entertainment. This is so
much more important.''

 &HT;    School administrators back away from notification policy
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Stung by criticism from students and
administrators, state college officials on Monday backed away from
plans to notify parents when their children violate drug or alcohol
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Steven Uhlfelder, who proposed the mandatory notification
policy in May, said the state should focus instead on providing
more education and counseling to students and only call parents in
the most extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be parental notification when the health and
safety of the student is in jeopardy, but under most circumstances,
for just the first-time offense, we don't need to be notifying
parents,'' Uhlfelder said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That's welcome news to students, who opposed the notification
plan on grounds that it invaded their privacy and treated them like
children. Many college administrators also thought an automatic
call policy was too strict _ and too unwieldy to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can provide students education and a safe environment
for experimentation, then we don't need to tell the parents every
time they pick up a can of beer,'' FAU assistant vice president for
student affairs Connie Foley said at a forum Monday.
</P>
<P>
   FAU formed a task force last month to figure out when and how
parents would be notified. While there is agreement that the
parents of first-time violators should not be called, after that it
gets murkier.
</P>
<P>
   After how many offenses in what time period should parents
notified? Should consideration be given to students whose parents
may pull them out of school because of a violation?
</P>
<P>
   FAU senior Raquel Charles, 22, was cited by FAU police for
serving alcohol to underage students when she was a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had called my dad, I would not be at FAU now,'' the
Panama native said Monday. ``He would have sent me back to Panama
because he does not allow that kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Regents are considering parental notification in the hopes
parents will be able to do what universities have struggled with
for years: change a culture of drinking on campuses that has led to
serious injury and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education alone has not altered or stopped these more severe
things from happening,'' said Barry Gregory, a substance abuse
counselor at FAU.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Florida in September, two young men _ one a
UF student _ died in alcohol-related violence at off-campus
apartments. Earlier this year, the UF fraternity Delta Chi was
kicked off campus for alcohol violations, among others.
</P>
<P>
   A parental-notification rule has already proven successful at
one college. University of Delaware officials, who tell parents of
all student violations, say parents end up talking to their
children about alcohol, preventing future problems.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 public universities and 15 private ones have adopted
parental-notification rules, most of them this year. For years,
colleges had only contacted parents when drinking led to death or
serious injury. But under other circumstances colleges were
reluctant because of federal privacy laws protecting students.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, however, Congress approved legislation that
explicitly allowed colleges to let parents know when students under
21 commit alcohol or drug violations.
</P>
<P>
   Uhlfelder said he will ask the Board of Regents in February to
require Florida's 10 public universities to come up with some sort
of parental-notification policy, but the specifics will be left to
each university.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, though, this policy will not stop under-age drinking,
Uhlfelder said. He has endorsed a plan drawn up by the Florida
Student Association to establish more counseling, education and
intervention plans on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Uhlfelder said the Board of Regents will also request $2 million
from the state legislature next year to hire more substance abuse
counselors.

   ``I have to give Uhlfelder credit for addressing this issue in a
way to give students rights and autonomy,'' said Kevin Mayeux,
executive director of the student association. ``Students are
adults, and they should be given some credence as adults.''

EGYPTAIR INQUIRY CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON CREW MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a week of carefully examining the cockpit
voice recorder and other evidence from EgyptAir Flight 990, federal
investigators remain focused on the actions of a reserve pilot who
they believe may have deliberately crashed the passenger jet into
the Atlantic Ocean, government officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continue working to develop what one called ``a
verified, acceptable transcript'' that the Egyptians and Americans
can agree to, one government official said. They are not expected
to finish for at least a few days. ``There is no rush to
judgment,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also no new theory. Stung by the furious reaction
of the Egyptian government, American investigators have re-examined
the available evidence, a process that has, as yet, they say,
uncovered no other plausible explanation for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Air safety investigators say that the National Transportation
Safety Board will ``characterize'' the transcript once it is
complete, but not release it. By law, the safety board releases
such transcripts when it opens public hearings, or, if it decides
not to hold a hearing as part of its investigation, when it
releases the majority of its factual findings.
</P>
<P>
   But if the case is handed over to the FBI, as the chairman of
the safety board has said the board is considering doing, then the
release of the transcript would be the FBI's decision. Federal law
bars releasing the actual tape.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Cairo have bitterly rejected the possibility that
the reserve pilot, Gameel el-Batouty, may have been responsible, an
assertion that is based on their interpretation of words spoken in
the final seconds of the flight and on their view that Batouty did
not suffer from obvious emotional problems that might have caused
him to commit such an act.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir flight, from New York to Cairo, crashed into the
ocean on Oct. 31, about 60 miles south of Nantucket, killing all
217 people aboard. The crash occurred about half an hour after
takeoff, just after the Boeing 767 reached its cruising altitude of
33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in Cairo, Egypt's transportation minister seemed to
absolve the EgyptAir crew of wrongdoing, telling the Egyptian
Parliament that the crash was not a result of human error. The
statement by the minister, Ibrahim el-Dumeiri, was Cairo's first
official assessment of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were attempts to imply that the accident happened as a
result of human error or a lack of proper maintenance, but Egyptian
documents prove the fallacy of that direction,'' Dumeiri said.
</P>
<P>
   Without offering another theory to explain the crash, he said
that investigators might need a year or more to determine the cause
of the crash. Dumeiri said that a phrase, referring to God, spoken
by Batouty before the plane began its steep dive, was not
indicative of someone about to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, American officials confirmed a report in Newsweek
magazine saying that Batouty had repeatedly uttered the phrase at
about the time the plane's autopilot was disconnected and the big
jet began its descent towards the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Americans and Egyptians appear to be odds over
their theories about the crash, they are working together. Dumeiri
said that Egypt was sending a psychologist and a voice specialist
to the United States. American officials said that several FBI
agents have flown to Cairo with the approval of the Egyptian
government to work with authorities there.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that their review of the evidence was
continuing, focused on voice and data recorders, radar-tracking
information and small sections of the plane found floating at sea.
</P>
<P>
   A remote-controlled submarine, equipped with video cameras,
continues mapping the wreckage on the sea floor as weather permits,
with aircraft experts on board the support ship helping to identify
what is on the video monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are working with a variety of scraps of evidence,
including information from the flight data recorder that shows that
the elevators, the moveable surfaces on the horizontal tail that
pilots use to raise or lower the nose, moved in opposite
directions.
</P>
<P>
   They are supposed to move in unison, but the one on the pilot's
side was deflected to raise the nose, and the one on the first
officer's side was deflected to lower the nose, a condition that
could occur if the two crew members were leaning heavily on their
controls in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said the 767's elevators usually move no more than 2
to 3 degrees up or down when in flight. The board said last week
that the two were split by about 7 degrees, which would mean that
each was deflected further than is normal in ordinary operations,
but in opposite directions.

GROUP WANTS TO RESTORE SITE WHERE THOREAU WALKED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Somewhere under a mountain of garbage is Ripple
Lake, a tiny kettle pond where Henry David Thoreau used to watch
the wind kick up the waves. The path he followed on everyday walks
near Walden Pond is down there, too, along with the dips in the
land he carefully mapped in his job as a surveyor.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a powerful imagination to conjure up America's most
famous naturalist at the Concord landfill today. Though the dump is
closed, the dirt-covered hills of trash remain, surrounded by a
wasteland of compost heaps, paint recycling shacks, and _ perhaps
soon _ cellular phone towers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a twist on the usual preservation fight, activists
including rock star Don Henley are rallying to save the dump,
calling on the town to turn the 35-acre site over to the state to
restore a 19th-century-style landscape, even if it is not the same
one Thoreau knew.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a national community preservation group called Scenic
America plans to declare the dump site and the Walden Woods around
it one of 12 ``last chance landscapes'' in the United States that
deserves protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep in mind the vision of the future. I view this as a
temporary condition,'' said Kathi Anderson, executive director of
Henley's Walden Woods Project, surveying the weed-strewn moonscape
that was a forest in Thoreau's time. ``We are in the midst of a
national treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Town officials say they, too, want to honor Thoreau's legacy,
but not at the expense of services to current residents. They say
they have agreed to conserve part of the dump for restoration as
long as one section remains in town hands for public works, such as
serving as a dumping ground for snow plowed from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in beautifying the area, but at the same
time, we've got some very real public safety and public health
concerns that are not going to go away,'' said Concord town manager
Chris Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the Concord landfill is part of a bigger fight
to reclaim the 2,680-acre Walden Woods, one of the most storied
natural landscapes in the country, but also one of the most abused.
Since Thoreau lived in his rustic cabin on the banks of Walden Pond
from 1845 to 1847, the woods have been chopped up by development,
from busy Route 2 to a trailer park to the landfill, which opened
in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Walden Pond itself became an enormously popular swimming hole
visited by over 600,000 people annually, making for a
disillusioning experience for anyone who expected to commune with
nature on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the late 1980s when developer Mortimer Zuckerman
tried to build an office complex on Brister's Hill, where Thoreau
did his seminal study of forest growth, conservationists have gone
on the offensive. Backed by the celebrity power and resources of
Henley, a member of the 1970s rock band the Eagles, the Walden
Woods Project has acquired 100 acres around the pond, including
Brister's Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, state and federal agencies have teamed up with the
conservationists to pursue even more ambitious goals. The state
Department of Environmental Management, which manages Walden Pond,
is planning to relocate Route 126 away from the pond's banks, and
Congress has authorized a study of the Walden Woods area by the
National Park Service and Walden Woods Project to develop a long
range plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the landfill remains perhaps the ugliest blight on the
woods, sitting right on Route 2 less than 300 yards from Thoreau's
cabin site. Townspeople were reluctant to create the dump in the
first place, voting for it only after local officials promised the
dump would be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, in 1994, residents voted unanimously to
close the landfill, and Walden activists thought they had won the
fight. In partnership with the Department of Environmental
Management, the Walden Woods Project even offered Concord $500,000
to defray the $1.2 million cost to cap the landfill, as long as the
land was turned over for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Concord officials had second thoughts about giving up
the landfill site. The land was perfect for storing leaves and yard
waste, as well as winter snow, they felt, and no one lived nearby
to complain about all the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, selectmen plan to open part of the dump site for cell phone
towers, in part to settle a lawsuit from AT&AMP;T over the town's
refusal to set aside other places for the towers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson of the Walden Woods Project argues that all the current
uses of the landfill site, with the possible exception of the
compost heaps, ``are incompatible with the history of the area and
the ecology,'' but she has gamely sought to find alternative sites
for the town.
</P>
<P>
   Working with researchers from the Massachusetts Audubon Society,
the Walden Woods Project has suggested a 10-acre state-owned site
that the town could have for free. But Concord officials say
neither the state land, nor any alternative so far, is good enough;
for instance, a wetland on the state-owned land would limit
development.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to agree with town officials, Anderson flew to Washington
for the press conference with Scenic America, highlighting 12
important but endangered landscapes across the country. Walden
Woods is the only New England site on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson acknowledges that it is too late to turn the landfill
back to the pitch pine forest and series of gullies that existed in
Thoreau's time. Because of the garbage underneath, it may not even
be possible to plant trees on the site.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jeff Collins of the Audubon Society has suggested
creating an open grassland reminiscent of farm fields in the
mid-19th century, and he has even found a spot to recreate Ripple
Lake, where Thoreau once watched butterflies and salamanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this site, present day, we're talking about a very
expensive restoration project and a very long-term one,'' said
Anderson. However, the landfill site is too important to let it
become a repository ``for any undesirable project that doesn't have
a home.''

professional investment advisers and financial planners, opting
instead to manage their own money with help from the Internet. The
Internet abounds with Web sites offering information and advice to
help you optimize your finances. Many of these sites are free,
while others charge just a few dollars per month. By contrast, a
professional money manager typically will charge a fee of 1 percent

SUIT CLAIMS WEB BOOKSELLER INTERCEPTED RIVAL'S E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An Internet bookseller in Greenfield, Mass. has been
accused of using a computer program to illegally intercept
thousands of e-mail messages from Amazon.com, possibly to steal
corporate strategies from its giant on-line rival, federal
prosecutors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one of the first times federal authorities have
charged that a company read e-mail between another firm and its
customers in an apparent attempt to gain an advantage, prosecutors
said. They say the case highlights an imminent danger in the
fiercely combative world of Internet commerce: on-line
entrepreneurs who may be tempted to surreptitiously gather
information on their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been extremely common to see hackers who get information
just because they can get it,'' said Jeanne M . Kempthorne, the
assistant US attorney in Boston prosecuting the case. ``What's new
about this is to see it in the corporate setting.''
</P>
<P>
   In a filing Monday in US District Court, prosecutors said that
in January 1998 Interloc altered an electronic mail program so that
it automatically intercepted and stored e-mail messages from
Amazon.com that were intended for book dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Interloc's new corporate owner Monday agreed to settle the case,
in which Interloc was charged with 10 counts of unlawfully
intercepting e-mail messages and one count of unauthorized
possession of passwords with intent to defraud. The owner also
agreed to pay a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the company's standpoint, this is old news,'' said Ethan
Schulman, a lawyer for Alibris, an Internet bookseller based in
Emeryville, Calif., which acquired Interloc last year. ``This was
an inherited problem, and it's a chapter they'd like to close.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulman also said ``appropriate disciplinary action'' has been
taken against Interloc employees involved in the e-mail
interceptions. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, between January and June of 1998,
Interloc intercepted thousands of Amazon.com e-mail messages and
stored them in a computer system. In one two-week period alone,
3,067 e-mail messages were intercepted, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they have not determined exactly how Interloc
used the messages once they were sent to a database but that it
appeared the firm wanted to learn about Amazon.com's dealings with
booksellers who were also Interloc customers.
</P>
<P>
   Interloc specialized in rare and used books. It also operated a
small Internet provider service, similar to larger services like
America Online or Netscape, called Valinet.
</P>
<P>
   Interloc's customers, many of them booksellers, had e-mail
accounts at Valinet through which they would receive messages from
Amazon.com. Interloc programmed a computer to sort out the e-mail
from Amazon.com, prosecutors said. In addition, Interloc employees
broke into other Internet service providers and stole customer
passwords, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly appears they did this for competitive reasons,
but the law doesn't care whether you're getting corporate secrets
or grocery lists,'' Kempthorne said. ``The only thing that matters
in terms of the law is that they intercepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said that while Alibris has acknowledged that Interloc
improperly intercepted e-mail, there is no evidence that it did so
to spy on Amazon.com. He said the e-mail was intercepted in the
course of trying to determine the source of a computer glitch that
was interferring with customer orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``No confidential customer information was obtained or
misused,'' he said. But he conceded that ``there were some people
doing things they shouldn't have been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the court filings didn't name specific Interloc employees
or say how many were involved, prosecutors said Monday that the
Interloc employees who programmed the e-mail interceptions acted
with the knowledge of company officials. Prosecutors also said some
believed they had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a computer culture out there that says, `If you can
do it, God bless you,' no matter what the law is,'' Kempthorne
said. ``They think of this as some sort of lawless frontier. Just
because they're brilliant doesn't mean they don't have to abide by
the rules the rest of us live by.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, observers said that corporate espionage on the
information superhighway was almost inevitable, in part because the
early days of the Internet were dominated by many individuals who
thought of hacking as an art form, not as a crime. That culture
presents a threat to the rapidly expanding number of companies that
want to do business on line but also need to protect proprietary
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is absolutely huge,'' said Pete Tasker, executive
director of security and information operations of Mitre Corp in
Bedford, Mass. ``That means there are lots of ways to listen in if
you really want to. This is the first time I've heard of a case
like this, but it's what we all worry about.''

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     How to Give Without Giving Up 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: My husband and I are in our early 80s. Our assets total &LR; 
 &UR; approximately $1.3 million, and our income approaches $70,000 &LR; 
 &UR; yearly. We would like to begin giving our children tax-free &LR; 
 &UR; gifts each year. We are healthy, but in the future, we may need &LR; 
 &UR; to pay for long-term home care. If we were to establish &LR; 
 &UR; certificates of deposit naming our children as joint owners, &LR; 
 &UR; would these be considered tax-free gifts? We want the money &LR; 
 &UR; available to ourselves throughout our lifetimes, and upon our &LR; 
 &UR; deaths, the children could cash in the certificates. &LR;
<P>
   &QL; 
A: What you are describing does not qualify as a gift for tax
purposes, says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller. He
says that under your plan, the money in the CDs would be considered
part of your estate and subject to estate taxes after you die.
</P>
<P>
   The money in the CDs would qualify as a gift if your children
withdrew the funds from the CDs during your lifetimes, or if you
removed your names from the account title. But you indicate that
you are specifically trying to avoid such moves, because you are
concerned about potential long-term-care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to discuss this matter with an estate lawyer.
There are compromises you can make _ such as setting up certain
kinds of trusts _ that would allow you to remove the money from
your taxable estate without completely giving up control of the
funds. As a rule, however, you would have to share control with
your children.
</P>
<P>
   Before you do this, you might want to re-read ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Q: I expect that at the end of the year, I will have a total of &LR; 
 &UR; $15,000 in short-term capital gains and $10,000 in short-term &LR; 
 &UR; capital losses for a net gain of $5,000. Also, I expect to have &LR; 
 &UR; $5,000 in interest from certificates of deposit. I will have &LR; 
 &UR; paid my stockbroker $8,000 of margin interest. Can I use the &LR; 
 &UR; entire $8,000 as a deduction to offset my investment gains? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   You can use margin interest _ the interest you pay your broker
to buy stock with borrowed funds _ to offset the full amount of
taxable investment income, such as capital gains and CD interest _
on Schedule A of IRS Form 1040. Since your net capital gain and
your CD interest total $10,000, you can use the full $8,000 of
interest as an offset.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your margin interest were to exceed your investment
income, you wouldn't lose any part of the deduction; you would
simply carry over the surplus to succeeding tax years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the concise information you enter on Schedule A,
you must file Form 4952, on which you provide fuller details about
your investment income and the interest you paid.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Avoiding Double Tax
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: My grandmother passed away recently, leaving me the bulk of &LR; 
 &UR; her estate and appointing me trustee. Her estate was worth well &LR; 
 &UR; over a million dollars, so it is subject to estate taxes. Part &LR; 
 &UR; of my inheritance includes U.S. savings bonds worth $150,000 _ &LR; 
 &UR; including accrued interest _ on the day my grandmother died. My &LR; 
 &UR; tax guy says that figure is the amount to be used in figuring &LR; 
 &UR; estate taxes. However, I'm also being told that when I go to &LR; 
 &UR; cash in these bonds, I will have to pay taxes again. Is this &LR; 
 &UR; correct? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It could happen. This is one of those unusual cases where an
inheritance might not be tax-free to the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the rules:
</P>
<P>
   The full $150,000 value of the bonds, consisting of principal
and of interest accrued before your grandmother's death, is subject
to estate taxes. In addition, the accrued interest is subject to
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't given me the information needed to say whether you
will be the one who pays the income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If your grandmother was reporting interest on her bonds each
year and paying taxes on it, then whatever interest she received in
1999, up to the time of her death, must be reported on her final,
posthumous income-tax return. In that case, you won't have to pay
tax on any interest that accrued on the bonds before your
grandmother died. However, you will have to pay tax on the interest
that accrued after her death.
</P>
<P>
   If your grandmother wasn't paying tax as the interest accrued,
then you and the other people administering the estate have a
choice. The taxes on the accrued interest can be paid off on your
grandmother's final return. Or you, as the beneficiary, can assume
the liability for the interest and pay the tax with your own
return. If you choose the latter method, you are entitled to deduct
from your income the amount of estate taxes that was paid on the
interest.
</P>
<P>
   You should do the arithmetic and decide which method puts the
greatest amount of after-tax money in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you assume the tax burden yourself, you don't
have to pay the taxes on the accrued income right away. You can
wait until you cash in the bonds _ or until they mature, which is
essentially the same thing.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Riding the Internet to Retirement  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Many well-to-do people these days are turning away from
professional investment advisers and financial planners, opting
instead to manage their own money with help from the Internet.
<P>
   The Internet abounds with Web sites offering information and
advice to help you optimize your finances. Many of these sites are
free, while others charge just a few dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a professional money manager typically will charge
a fee of 1 percent to 1.5 percent of your assets per year. That's
$2,500 to $3,750 on a $250,000 portfolio, which is about the
minimum size that most professionals consider worthy of their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The substantial fees _ combined with a long bull market that
just won't quit _ has left many people believing that they don't
need the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who needs expert advice when they can pick big
winners by throwing darts at the daily stock tables? Or by putting
their money in an index mutual fund and letting it ride?
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking could prove dangerous if the stock market
ever tanks, some experts warn. Once it becomes tough to succeed
financially, a lot of people might switch off their computers and
come flocking back to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many permutations in life, and it is difficult
for any software product to handle that,'' says Robert Sterling, an
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you have three kids going to college? What if you have
a handicapped sibling or child? There are very specific financial
needs out there. It will be a while before there are solutions on
the Internet good enough to eclipse a professional planner.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, such warnings have fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers can find not only investment advice, but also
scads of retirement-planning calculators on the Internet. They also
can find tips on how to plan for college, draft wills, minimize
taxes and determine their insurance needs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these resources are pretty basic, but others are quite
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The king of them all _ the one against which the others are
judged _ is Financial Engines (www.financialengines.com), a
retirement planner created by Nobel Prize-winning economist William
F. Sharpe of Stanford University, a leading expert on portfolio
modeling.
</P>
<P>
   The site was opened to the public in June. Previously, it was
available only to employees of companies that subscribed to the
service at a cost of about $50 per employee per year.
</P>
<P>
   After you log on to the site and register, Financial Engines
prompts you to list all the holdings in your portfolio and to
answer numerous questions about your income, risk tolerance and
when you hope to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharpe model crunches the numbers and feeds in assumptions
about future inflation, interest rates, dividends and the relative
performances of various classes of assets, such as bonds versus
stocks and large stocks versus small. It then tells you the
percentage probability that you will wind up with enough retirement
income to fit your plans.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Financial Engines is free.
</P>
<P>
   If you want detailed investment advice on how to improve your
portfolio, you will have to subscribe to the service at a price of
$14.95 every three months. Financial Engines will then name
specific mutual funds and tell you exactly how many shares to buy
or sell.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggioncalda, chief executive of Financial Engines, says
100,000 people have registered on the site since June, including
10,000 paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial professionals say they aren't too concerned about
their Internet competition.
</P>
<P>
   Says Norm Boone, of Boone Financial Advisors in San Francisco:
``Most of us who have taken in-depth looks at Financial Engines or
other retirement programs figure that if we were to give that same
kind of advice, we might be graded as a C.''
</P>
<P>
   People with ``unusual issues about cash flows, mortality and how
long they are going to work'' will always need professionals, Boone
says. Harold Evensky, a Florida financial planner and president of
the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, figures that
Internet financial sites might actually be a plus for his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``An educated consumer is good for us,'' he explains. ``It makes
it easier to work with people and helps them make better
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing number of hard-core consumers who
consider the Internet sufficient in itself, and have no intention
of delegating their financial planning to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband died a few years ago, retired San Francisco
saleswoman Iris Berman, 72, an investment novice, found herself
sitting uneasily on hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets _
mostly cash.
</P>
<P>
   In bygone days, that would have made her an exceptionally hot
prospect for a financial planner. In fact, several of them
solicited her, and she interviewed them conscientiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was very lovely,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But she decided to do it herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady was going to charge me $2,500 every three months,''
she says. ``I don't think she could have earned me that much money.
Financial advisers don't know any more than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically every day she browses the financial sites maintained
by America Online, Yahoo and TheStreet.com. She also rummages
through the analyst reports, financial data and news on the Web
site of Charles Schwab, her broker.
</P>
<P>
   She has big gains from investments in Microsoft, Intel and,
especially, Cisco _ ``I own a tremendous amount.`` She concedes
that such volatile stocks might seem dicey for a septuagenarian,
but says they are ``for my childrens' inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   To balance her tech-stock gambles she has placed 57 percent of
her $850,000 portfolio in fixed-income securities. She says she
needs them for current income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security doesn't pay the rent in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Chatterjee, 66, a retired Air India pilot who lives in San
Francisco, says he was ``totally dependent'' on a financial planner
until early this year, when he dismissed her and began managing his
money himself, drawing on the resources available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acquired a personal computer, taught myself how to use it
and have been doing pretty good on my own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He gets many of his investment ideas from the Motley Fool Web
site (www.fool.com), which contains a retirement calculator and
provides profuse information about insurance, trusts and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Satterjee says his human financial planner was ``too
conservative,'' putting 40 percent of his roughly $300,000 in
assets into bonds and cash. Although he is retired, he wanted a
livelier portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   He boosted the proportion of stocks and stock mutual funds to 86
percent, with a heavy emphasis on tech issues such as Applied
Materials, Cisco, Intel and Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to personal investments, one can do quite
successfully and effectively when one takes sufficient time and
interest to read up and follow up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Trudy Jaycox, 43, a Berkeley consultant to the Peace Corps, says
she has amassed a ``substantial'' portfolio by investing her
savings in no-load stock mutual funds. She is particularly partial
to those operated by the hot-performing JanusFund group, which was
recommended to her by her father, a successful investor in his own
right.
</P>
<P>
   She researches funds through the Morningstar Inc. Web site
(www.morningstar.com). She also is a steady user of Motley Fool and
Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), which is notable for its many links to other
sites that specialize in retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter from a woman planner who invited me to lunch at
a restaurant,'' she recalls. ''I said: `I don't need you to make
money, I'm doing fine.' Investing is not rocket science. Right now,
you have to be a knucklehead to not be making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fulton, 58, of Danville, a retired General Motors executive
with a seven-figure portfolio, says he makes ``100 percent of my
own investment decisions,'' based almost entirely on what he can
glean from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites he favors are Hoover's Inc. (www.hoovers.com),
which lets you screen thousands of stocks in seconds, using the
parameters of your choice; CNN Finance (www.cnnfn.com), which
includes a mortgage calculator, a college planner and a stock
screener, and CBS MarketWatch (cbs.marketwatch.com), which offers
advice on estate taxes, insurance and writing wills.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself investing ``has always been my hobby,'' he says.
He says he is ``amazed'' at ``how little sophistication financial
planners have.'' He says many of them seem incapable of offering
sound advice about such fundamental matters as whether to convert a
traditional individual retirement account to a Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Like Satterjee, Fulton complains that planners are ``too
conservative,'' trying to get clients to put ``half your money in
bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very aggressive investor and feel I am going to live to
my mid- to late 80s,'' he observes. ``There are a lot of years left
in there to stand some ups and downs in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that when he was working in Rochester, N.Y., some
years ago, he discussed his retirement package with a Peat Marwick
financial planner whose services were paid for by GM. G.M.  &LR; The man
was sent over from Buffalo, because Peat Marwick didn't have a
planner in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about two hours,'' Fulton recalls, ``he said: `I'm
embarrassed. I'm learning more from you than you're learning from
me.''' He offered Fulton the opportunity _ which he declined _ to
work for Peat Marwick in Rochester.

CEBALLOS UNVEILS LAKE-VACATION LIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Remember a few years ago when Cedric Ceballos
impulsively left the Los Angeles Lakers in the middle of the
1995-96 season to go on a four-day fishing trip to Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Ceballos now says it didn't happen that way.
Ceballos says the Lakers, with his good graces, fabricated the
story to protect a touchy personal situation involving a member of
his family which he didn't want to be publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a problem we had to iron out, it got emotional,
and it got tough,'' Ceballos said. ``I just was not thinking
straight. I explained it to the organization, and I explained it to
my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just something that, for the sake of my family member,
I tried not to get it out publicly. I congratulated the Lakers, and
I appreciate all of them for not saying anything and for keeping it
as a problem toward me, and for just putting the blame all on me
instead of them letting my family business out in the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Ceballos, now the top Mavericks' reserve, says he
believes some NBA executives mistook him as a malcontent who walked
out on his teammates for selfish reasons. He wonders if that might
have had something to do with the lack of interest in signing him
as a free agent the past two off-seasons. He settled for a
two-year, $7.4 million contract to re-sign with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   He now acknowledges that perhaps he should have said what he's
saying now sooner to avoid getting a bad reputation around the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to sacrifice my job for a couple of days, and if I
had to sacrifice losing some money, then I don't have a problem
with leaving and trying to help \Rmy family\S fight through their
crisis,'' Ceballos said. ``This way it kept my family business
inside the family, and it didn't embarrass or keep my family
members in a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ceballos is really a Renaissance man. He has his own
website. He worked as a television reporter during the WNBA
playoffs this summer. And he has a record company that employs a
lot of friends whom he grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, 30, sings R&AMP;B and rap music on a album that is
scheduled to be released in January. The name of the album: Nuff
Ced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real fun album,'' Ced said. ``We do a lot of comical
stuff on it. It's really an entertaining album; everybody in the
family will be able to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ceballos cannot relate to is the rash of flagrant fouls
that has cost him portions of the past three seasons. Loren Meyer,
Danny Manning and Chris Mills have committed flagrant fouls on
Ceballos, leaving him with two broken wrists early last season and
knee injuries the two previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe my season ended like that three years in a row
after flagrant fouls by friends of mine,'' Ceballos said. ``I still
haven't seen the \RMeyer hit\S from last year, and I really don't
want to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing against Loren or the rules in the NBA, but I just
wanted to play. It's real tough to sit there and watch and not be
able to show by example. It's good for Dirk \RNowitzki\S to come
out of the game and I tell him something, but it's even better if
I'm out there fighting the battle with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos is the Mavericks' second-leading scorer with 17.9
points per game but has been in a slump of late; he is 5-for-24
from the field in his past two games.
</P>
<P>
   However, forward Michael Finley says Ceballos needs some scoring
support from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have so much respect around the league as one of the
best one-on-one players in the league like Cedric, when he gets the
ball he's going to attract a lot of attention,'' Finley said. ``If
guys around him are knocking down shots, it's going to take more
pressure off of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos worked with a personal trainer, Marcus Reed, this past
summer for the first time in his 10-year NBA career. Reed used to
run track for UCLA and helped Ceballos strengthen his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past during the summer, I just goofed around,''
Ceballos said. ``I was a real bad stretcher, so I worked on
stretching, conditioning, and I put myself in the right frame of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you do that, you can come out a little tougher
mentally. For instance, when we're doing sprints, running up the
hill or weight lifting, you try to compete, and it makes it more
fun.'' nn

HAUNTING WEEKEND AWAITS COUPLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Fred Couples steps onto the national stage this week, a
stand-in tapped by tragedy to play a starring role.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight the golfer has basked in before will swathe him in
little warmth. The privilege of playing in the Skins Game Saturday
and Sunday in Indio, Calif., will be hard for Couples to feel for
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   For a few days in the desert, the Los Angeles resident will get
a glimpse of what it must have been like to be Lyndon B. Johnson
running the country in the weeks after John F. Kennedy's
assassination in November of 1963. Or Chris Knight running the
floor for Loyola Marymount University in the weeks after center
Hank Gathers' death in March of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson and Knight, Couples is standing in for a fallen
cohort.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart was slated to join David Duval, Mark O'Meara and
Sergio Garcia in the 18-hole, made-for-television tournament. His
death in October in a freakish plane crash left a hollow too deep
for one man or one month to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, 40, understands this. His insides have been like the
middle of a fallen souffle since he heard the news on October 25
that the private jet carrying Stewart and five other people crashed
in a grassy field in South Dakota after flying a few hours on
auto-pilot, the plane's shell rendered a tin coffin by some
mechanical failure early in the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bizarre the way he died,'' Couples said. ``I still
can't believe he's gone. If Payne had been sick and we all knew it,
it would have been hard enough to deal with his death. But it was
such an unbelievable thing that happened to him, it makes it harder
to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples knows he isn't the only one shaken to his spikes by
Stewart's death.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects people on both sides of the ropes at Landmark Golf
Club will look at him and see Stewart's ghost. That's why you won't
catch Couples wearing the plus-fours Stewart favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't,'' said Couples, who'd sooner play in his boxers
than give the specter substance.
</P>
<P>
   He expects taming the 7,068-yard layout will be a breeze, next
to controlling his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awkward feeling, no doubt,'' said Couples, a two-time
winner and seven-time participant in the Skins event, which has
been held since 1983. ``I always appreciate playing in this event,
but in this situation I guess I really don't know how to feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing they've chosen me to play. It's not a great
thing that I'm here. I obviously wish I wasn't playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples won his first Skins title in 1995 and repeated the feat
in 1996. His father's death kept him out of the 1997 field. Couples
returned last year and won three skins and $150,000 to increase his
all-time-leading Skins earnings to $1,340,000.
</P>
<P>
   He won't pocket a dime this week even if he wins every hole and
hoards the $1 million purse. Couples has pledged all his earnings
from the event to the Payne Stewart Memorial and the First Orlando
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing for his charity,'' Couples said, ``so every time I
make a putt, I'll be doing something to honor him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-year tour veteran is known for his loose, loopy swing,
not his loose lips. Considering the circumstances, Couples came off
sounding more classy than brassy when he announced, ``I hope to win
every cent. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples said he's ``playing for Payne and his family and I'm not
the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   That right there is the silver lining. If anything has been
gained by losing Stewart, it's that the public portrait of
professional golfers as cardboard personalities wrapped in
cardigans has been torn to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   As players have honored Stewart in ways great and small, the
tour's camaraderie is what has stood out, not its cutthroat
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The public saw golfers form a human chain around Stewart's
widow, Tracey, at his funeral and wear knickers at the tournament
he was headed to when he died. The public saw a lot of so-called
robots in danger of rusting, so fierce were their tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a first- or second-year player that not everybody
knew,'' Couples said. ``Payne played on the tour 21 years. It's
going to be awkward not just this week but next year and every year
at tournaments where he played and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart played in the Skins event four consecutive years,
beginning in 1991. He made more money in the event than anyone save
Couples.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart assuredly will be a major focal point again this year,
if Couples can help it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is try to do my best,'' Couples said, ``and make
everyone remember why I'm here.''

MARKET PLACE: DISCORD AT THE CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After more than 150 years at the top, the Chicago
Board of Trade can no longer call itself the world's largest
futures and options exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It has been eclipsed by an electronic marketplace called Eurex,
formed nine years ago and adopted last year in a merger of the
German and Swiss derivative exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Though the board of trade remains the biggest futures and
options exchange in the United States, it is torn over just how to
meet the growing challenge of electronic trading systems, the same
challenge facing the nation's biggest stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the once-pioneering board of trade _ which began as a
place to trade commodities and now incorporates complex financial
instruments _ can retain its domestic leadership depends in part on
its ability to put internal squabbles to rest.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last year, the board of trade has been mired in
a series of nasty disputes that have thoroughly disrupted
operations and pitted its chief executive against its chairman.
More recently, the disputes have set a group of traders against the
chief executive and the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The discord was so pronounced that earlier this year six
investment banks decided not to advise the exchange on its plans to
become a for-profit corporation. Seat prices at the exchange have
plummeted 25 percent in the last month, and other firms are having
second thoughts about alliances with it, fearing gridlock,
according to people who work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are symptomatic of the problems going on here,''
said Jacob Morowitz, a longtime exchange member. ``We are
directionless and rudderless. We don't have leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest volley in the dispute came just a week ago, when
board of trade members _ mostly traders and brokers in the
agricultural and financial trading pits _ voted in favor of four
petitions seeking, in part, to curtail the power of the board and
Thomas Donovan, the longtime chief executive and president who has
pushed for more electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   That move came just months after David Brennan, the chairman
popular with the traders in the pits, tried to oust Donovan in a
coup attempt that was strongly rebuffed by the board.
</P>
<P>
   The two men say they have since buried their differences, but
people close to them say they are merely being cordial and that bad
feelings remain.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan has overseen the day-to-day operations of the exchange
for more than a decade; last month he received a series of
petitions that forced him to make his salary public and stripped
him of the power to nominate public directors. He published his
salary _ $1.4 million a year _ then derided the petitions, calling
them the work of a small group of dissidents bent on undermining
top executives at a critical time. ``While we're doing this,'' he
said, ``Rome is burning.''
</P>
<P>
   The cry is a familiar one these days in the nation's financial
markets, which face a period of upheaval brought on by rapid
technology and rapidly increasing investor demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the exchanges are facing the same problem,'' said Barry
Lind, chairman of Lind Waldock, a discount futures broker in
Chicago. ``They've had a system that worked for more than 100
years, and now there's a more efficient system. If the exchanges
don't adapt, they die.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to move to electronic trading without disrupting or
cannibalizing the existing market of face-to-face ``open outcry''
trading is problematic, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the trading pits in Chicago fear the exchange could do
away with the old system of shouts and hand signals too quickly;
others fear the exchange will move too slowly into cyberspace _ and
eventually lose its grip on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition used to come from domestic exchanges and foreign
exchanges and now it comes from ECNs,'' said Donovan, referring to
fast-growing electronic communication networks that match orders.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions surfaced more than a year ago, when the membership
narrowly voted out Patrick Arbor, a pro-technology chairman, in
favor of Brennan, a 41-year-old soybean trader whom Arbor dubbed
``a member of the Flat Earth Society'' partly because of his
opposition to an alliance to build a joint electronic trading
platform with Eurex.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Brennan took over, the members voted to end the
alliance. Later, it reversed that decision and agreed to spend $50
million on a link with Eurex scheduled to begin operation next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan now says he is an enthusiastic backer of the plan.
``We're embracing technology,'' he said. ``Sometimes we get a bad
rap because we have a floor.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office recently, Brennan looked
confident. He said he had named a task force to study how to speed
decision-making at the exchange so that it can compete better with
electronic upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are coming from Cantor Fitzgerald, a large broker
that has begun trading futures electronically; possibly from the
NASDAQ stock market; and from BrokerTec Global, an electronic
alliance being formed by the biggest Wall Street firms, all members
of the board of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven largest firms are going into competition against
us,'' Brennan said. ``We need to modernize and get ready to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan and Donovan do agree that the exchange should do what it
has long done best: hedge. They will offer electronic trading and
open outcry trading side by side, and let the customer choose.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange will also reduce the number of people on its floor
and use computers to create a faster route for transactions to get
to the trading pits. By forming the alliance with Eurex, the
exchange hopes volume, down 8 percent this year, will begin to
rebound next year.
</P>
<P>
   Arbor, the former exchange chairman, has an alternative plan. He
has asked the exchange to spin off its electronic unit into a
separate public company, which would compete against the floor
traders, but would also reward them as shareholders in a system
that he expects will eventually dominate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is like the perfect hedge: Let's spin it off and raise
money. Bank One did it with Wingspan,'' Arbor said, referring to
Bank One Corp.'s online banking arm. ``No matter who wins, Bank One
or Wingspan, the shareholders of Bank One win.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbor _ who says he is considering running for chairman again
next year _says that if the exchange runs both a floor and an
electronic system, pressure from the floor traders will impede the
growth of the online unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accept my plan, the membership has to accept the fact that
cannibalization can occur,'' he said. ``Ergo, it's better to eat
ourselves than let someone else eat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brennan and Donovan appear to be trying to mend their
relationship. After the petition vote a week ago, they issued a
joint statement: ``The members have spoken and we move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bloomfield, a longtime exchange member who helped write
several of the petitions, said they were not an attack on Donovan
or on the board, but simply a desire to know more about the
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to an electronic trading format and converting to public
ownership are very difficult steps, he said. ``As we evolve, the
question is what kind of a format do we want? I don't know. But
what we needed was transparency and accountability.''

A WAR OF WORDS IN BATTLE FOR MANNESMANN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Chris Gent, chief executive of Vodafone Airtouch, flew
to Frankfurt on Monday to promote his company's $127.7 billion
hostile bid for Mannesmann, the German conglomerate, to tell
skeptical workers that there would be no job cuts if the takeover
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Gent, responding to criticism in Germany, including a
denunciation by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of hostile takeovers,
also sought to portray the deal as an enormously beneficial
transaction for both Vodafone and Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, the biggest mobile-phone company, formally began the
takeover on Friday in a direct appeal to Mannesmann shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Esser, the chief executive of Mannesmann, has vowed to
keep the company, a big player in telephone and wireless
communications, independent. He spent much of Monday in meetings
with advisers, reviewing the company's possible moves, according to
one executive who spent part of the day with him.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the company said Monday night that
Mannesmann was considering whether to accelerate the previously
announced sale of its automotive and engineering units and was
expected to provide details of its spinoff strategy on Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to grow more skeptical about Vodafone's chances
of success. Mannesmann shares fell 6.95 euros in Frankfurt on
Monday, to 186.15 euros (about $191.73), the second consecutive
drop. The shares have fallen more than 10 percent since Friday,
when Vodafone announced its stock offer _ valued at 240-euros a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Vodafone fell 0.25 pence here, to 275.25 pence
($4.46). Vodafone's American depository receipts closed on the New
York Stock Exchange at $44.375, down $2.625; each ADR represents 10
ordinary shares.
</P>
<P>
   As details of Vodafone's bid emerged Monday, it became clear
that if its offer for Mannesmann succeeded, Vodafone would have to
take the largest corporate loan ever to finance the transaction.
According to executives close to the company, Vodafone is
considering borrowing about $36 billion to make the acquisition and
to refinance its current debt.

IRAQ CUTS OIL EXPORTS THAT PAY FOR FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Expands earlier story.) 
(lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Frustrated by a decision in the Security
Council to renew its oil-for food program for only two weeks, Iraq
on Monday unexpectedly began to cut off its oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   The sales are permitted under a specially regulated U.N. program
meant to provide food and other basics for ordinary Iraqis
suffering under long-lasting economic sanctions. The sanctions are
meant to punish Baghdad for not showing that it has eliminated
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq fails to carry out the food program, ``it will be
thumbing its nose at the international community again,'' said
James Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis said they were protesting the Security Council's
decision last week to extend the program for only two weeks,
instead of the normal six months. The shorter extension was set
when Russia was unable to change the terms in Iraq's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and officials said that it was not entirely clear
what Iraq had to gain, but that Iraq has repeatedly created crises
when events were not moving in its favor, and it sometimes came out
ahead by doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of oil sales could allow Iraq to show the world
how economic sanctions are again crippling the lives of its
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Actions by the secretive government are rarely fully explained
and officials at the United Nations have become accustomed to
waiting for Iraqi policy changes to play themselves out. Initial
impressions late Monday were that the oil cutoff was temporary but
could hurt Iraq's reputation further.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said, ``Every time that Iraq shows its contempt for the
world, and its contempt for the world's concern about the people of
Iraq, it only makes it harder for Iraq's positions to be taken
seriously in the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said that independent oil
experts reported Monday morning that the Iraqis had cut the flow of
oil to the Turkish port of Ceyhan and were preparing to stop
shipments from the Iraqi port of Mina al Bakr on Tuesday. They are
its main export points.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, crude-oil prices rose in the New York market by
almost a dollar, to over $27 a barrel, a nine-year high. Iraq had
been trading about 5 percent of the oil sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq earned over $7 billion in
the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to reinstitute a disarmament program and send
inspectors back to Iraq after a year during which President Saddam
Hussein has been free of on-the-ground arms surveillance, the five
permanent council members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States _ have been working almost nonstop on a compromise
that would allow Russia, Iraq's strongest ally on the council, to
support a new plan, or at least not veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say that the Iraqis may have been stunned by
reports that the Russians might be willing to drop their strong
advocacy for Iraq. Reports last week suggested that Moscow had
informally offered the United States a deal to soften Russian
opposition to a Western resolution on Iraq, in return for U.S.
restraint in criticizing Moscow's war in Chechnya. The Russians
deny that such an offer was made.
</P>
<P>
   France, which at times has argued in favor of Iraq, is now
considered to be part of the consensus behind a tougher resolution
demanding that Iraq accept and cooperate with arms inspectors in
return for a suspension of sanctions _ but not a total removal of
sanctions _ for renewable periods.
</P>
<P>
   The French say they are concerned that Iraq, with a record of
secret prohibited arms programs, is not being monitored. France is
now expected to back the new inspection system being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has said repeatedly that it will not accept any inspection
system that does not lift sanctions first. The government, which
has long chafed under the close monitoring and tight financial
controls of the oil-for-food program, may be trying to hold it
hostage at a critical moment to win concessions on both plans.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and officials here say that Iraq may be concerned
that the oil plan and inspections may be dealt with as a package in
the council, leaving little room for maneuver for the Iraqis. The
Russians have consistently rejected this linkage but ironically
made it more likely by delaying the extension last week after the
Russian delegation failed to change it in Iraq's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council's permanent members are sharply divided on
several parts of the arms-inspection plan.
</P>
<P>
   These include how long to wait before Iraq would qualify for a
suspension of sanctions after demonstrating cooperation, how long
the suspensions would run before being reviewed and how independent
a new inspection commission would be.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the United Nations is that by shutting down oil
flows and continuing to oppose a new disarmament plan, Iraq might
effectively free itself of foreign supervision. This would raise
the question of military action to enforce Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States has been silent about this possibility, in
contrast to last year's bellicose policy, which led to the bombing
of Iraq in December _ and the effective end of the old U.N. arms
control system there.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials were taking a ``wait and see'' attitude and were
leaving the administrator of the program and his staff in place in
Iraq, and civilian goods ordered earlier were continuing to flow to
the country, Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of supplies in the pipeline, so our
work doesn't need to stop just because the oil stopped flowing,''
he said. ``Our hope is that this can eventually be worked out and
they will continue the oil-for-food program.''
</P>
<P>
   The program _ long delayed by Iraq and never really liked by
Baghdad, which resented the controls and monitoring of sales and
purchases that came with it _ was intended to relieve the hardships
of ordinary Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990. In April 1991, after the war to free Kuwait ended,
sanctions were not only left in place but also linked to a Security
Council disarmament plan designed to destroy Iraq's prohibited
biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs as well as the
capacity to rebuild them.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1991, it was becoming apparent to the Security
Council that the disarming of Iraq by the U.N. Special Commission
would take considerably longer than expected and that the sanctions
were beginning to take a toll on Iraqi civilians. The council
offered Saddam the first oil-for-food program, which was rejected
by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, a second oil-for-food plan was presented to
the Iraqis, who finally accepted in 1996 after months of stalling,
and goods began to arrive in 1997. The current plan, as amended,
allowed Iraq to export $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months.
Because of rising oil prices and Iraq's inability to meet past
quotas, the Security Council had allowed the total sales to
increase to about $7 billion in the six-month period that has just
ended.

EXCERPTS FROM BRADLEY'S SPEECH ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from prepared remarks by former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey for a speech on Monday at New Hampshire
College in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of that famous handshake between the leaders of
our two political parties in 1995 _ President Clinton and Newt
Gingrich. It was a very public handshake signifying a very public
commitment to campaign finance reform. And then nothing happened.
Nothing happened in 1995, in '96, in '97. Nothing happened in '98
or '99.
</P>
<P>
   Five years have passed. Two elections have passed. Two sessions
of Congress have come and gone. And still nothing has happened.
Even after 1996, and the very public problems with both parties,
we've still seen no action. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you. It's because no one in Washington wants the
system changed. The reality is that behind every public handshake
on this issue, there has always been a secret handshake. That
tacit, secret handshake signals an agreement among politicians not
to upset a system that they use to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The public handshake was meant to be a commitment by politicians
to the public. But the secret handshake is a commitment to the
status quo, a deal between politicians and business to keep things
as usual. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Now let's go back to 1996. At that time, there were questions
about where politics ended and government began in the Clinton-Gore
fund-raising efforts. Now we hear that Cabinet officers are
structuring their schedules and their announcements so that the
vice president can finance his political campaign when his funds
run short.
</P>
<P>
   What's happened here? What's changed? The answer is the same now
as the handshake _ nothing has happened. Nothing has changed. The
more politicians talk about change, the more things stay the same.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   I think people understand that campaign finance reform is the
beginning of real reform throughout government.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I've challenged all the other candidates to promise
that if they are their party's nominee, they will join me in not
using soft money for their campaigns. And you know what? The vice
president's campaign chairman actually attacked me for espousing
this core Democratic Party principle _ a principle that is in our
party's platform, a principle supported and endorsed by President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   We can restore trust among the people of this country. We know
how to do it; the question is if we have the will to do it. It can
be done, if we want it to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, reforming the way we finance campaigns _ getting big
money out of politics _ is the key to making progress on the issues
that matter most. We need campaign finance reform. We need it now.
It is time to stop talking. We must restore trust in government.
It's time to do so. The American people shouldn't have to wait any
longer.

NISSAN MOTOR REPORTS 6-MONTH LOSS OF MORE THAN $3 BILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Addressing unrecognized liabilities that had been
festering for years, the Nissan Motor Co. reported a loss of more
than $3 billion Monday for the first six months of the automaker's
fiscal year and said it expected an annual loss of more than $5.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The projected annual loss would be the biggest ever for a
nonfinancial Japanese company. It would also be Nissan's seventh
annual loss in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than portraying the results as a sign of weakness,
Nissan officials presented them as a stark reflection of their
excruciating effort to overhaul the sagging, debt-ridden operations
of the No. 3 Japanese automaker, which sold a 37 percent stake in
itself to Renault SA of France last March.
</P>
<P>
   Renault took management control of Nissan as part of the deal
and has been working aggressively to clean up longstanding
financial problems that have lurked on Nissan's balance sheet. The
Renault-Nissan partnership has been closely watched not only by the
global automotive industry but as an indication of corporate
Japan's willingness to change.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan said losses for the six months that ended Sept. 30
totaled 325.6 billion yen, or $3.05 billion at current exchange
rates. The company said the loss would widen to 590 billion yen, or
$5.57 billion by the end of its fiscal year in March.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the six-month loss reflects accounting adjustments for
setting aside 274.2 billion yen, or about $2.6 billion, to plug a
hole in Nissan's pension fund. The company also set aside 48.1
billion yen, or about $450 million, against future warranty
obligations and 46.6 billion yen or about $440 million for the
first installment of its ``revival'' plan, the all-encompassing
overhaul it announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearing the past to pave the way for the future,''
said Thierry Moulonguet, Nissan's deputy chief financial officer
who joined Nissan after his former employer Renault, purchased its
stake in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of the future was embedded in the company's announcements
Monday. It used what are known as consolidated accounting rules,
which cover the entire Nissan group of businesses, to calculate the
company's profits and losses and assess its balance sheet, six
months ahead of the deadline for adopting such rules.
</P>
<P>
   The news release was composed in English, the language the
company has adopted since Renault's investment, and translated into
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Those breakthroughs were lost, however, in Nissan's sea of red
ink. ``I thought they had misplaced the decimal point when I first
saw the headlines,'' said Koji Endo, an automotive analyst at
Schroders Japan Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Endo said he was taken aback by the size of accounting
adjustments the the company was making beyond the expenses recorded
for its restructuring plan, under which it will close five plants,
lower costs by 1 trillion yen and eliminate 21,000 jobs.
Additionally, Nissan will record a 141 billion yen accounting
charge for restructuring in the second half of the fiscal year,
thus meeting its goal of paying for the plan in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of the extraordinary charges in addition to the
restructuring charges is big,'' Endo said. ``And this might not be
the end of those kinds of charges.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely that fear that aborted a deal between Nissan
and DaimlerChrysler earlier this year, which led Nissan into an
alliance with Renault instead.
</P>
<P>
   The results announced Monday also showed sales slid 9.9 percent
to 3 trillion yen, or $28.7 billion, in the first six months of
Nissan's fiscal year, as the company lagged behind its competitors
in the Japanese and European market.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, declines in the cost of servicing Nissan's debts
and gains on stocks the company holds help push operating profits
in the first six months of the year to 58.5 billion yen, or $551.8
million a 125 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected operating profits to climb to 90
billion yen by the end of the fiscal year, somewhat shy of the goal
announced in May and an 18 percent decline from the previous year,
when operating profits were 109.7 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that the yen's value has risen steeply in the
last six months, the results were surprisingly strong. In the first
half of the current fiscal year, the average exchange rate was 117
yen to the dollar, compared with 137 yen to the dollar in the same
period last year. A stronger currency tends to hurt a company's
earnings by reducing the profits from businesses overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan said it also had made progress in whittling down its pile
of debt, largely because of Renault's investment. Its total
consolidated debt was 2.53 trillion yen on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The debt figures in particular demonstrated the effect that
consolidated accounting will have on corporate Japan, which is
required to adopt it by the end of this fiscal year. At the end of
the last fiscal year, Nissan's net debts stood at 2.91 trillion
yen. The figure was restated Monday: On a consolidated basis, it
had climbed to 3.53 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has pledged to reduce its debts to 700 billion yen by the
end of fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The company released its financial data after Japan's stock
market had closed. Nissan shares fell 33 yen, or 5.6 percent, in
Tokyo trading to 550 yen, but are still up about 57 percent so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's American depositary receipts, traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, fell 67.5 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $10.125.

ANOTHER BATTLE, AS DETROIT MUSEUM CLOSES AN EXHIBIT EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Visitors to the Detroit Institute of Arts, the grande
dame of museums here, could visit a room in the modern gallery to
see a toy Jesus wearing a condom, a pile of human excrement and a
brazil nut labeled with a racial epithet. For two days.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-room exhibition, containing 15 provocative pieces,
was shuttered on Friday after its brief run because of concerns
that it would offend the community, and the local artist whose work
now stands behind closed doors has accused the museum of
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director disagrees. ``The museum is always
selecting works of art, and selection is not censorship,'' said
Graham W.J. Beal, who joined the museum two months ago. ``Asking an
artist to exclude one work in favor of another is not censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist saw it differently. ``It would be like if I painted a
picture of a nude and they said it might offend some people, why
don't you paint a dress on it,'' said Jef J. Bourgeau, who runs a
nonprofit museum in nearby Pontiac, Mich. ``It is push-your-button
art, it is aggressive art, but it is art.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beal saw it more as a question of choosing his battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be the ones comfortable with the position we are
taking, and not just say, well, the artist demands it so we are
going to put it in the show,'' said Beal, who likened the situation
to that of an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
``Sensation,'' that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently tried
unsuccessfully to shut down. ``The museum and art become a
political and moral football kicked around by all sorts of
people,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized the decision
to close the exhibition, called ``Van Gogh's Ear,'' which opened
Wednesday and was to have run through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of modern art in general is to allow people to
make up their own mind about art,'' said Kary L. Moss, executive
director of the Michigan branch of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeau's exhibition was commissioned two years ago, and he had
worked with a museum curator in planning it. But the new museum
director had not been aware of what the exhibition would contain
before it opened, said a museum spokeswoman, Annmarie Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant to explore how artists are intertwined with the art
they create, particularly in the context of artists who had gained
notoriety in the 1990s, Bourgeau said.
</P>
<P>
   One item on display is a jar of urine, labeled as that used in
Andres Serrano's photograph of a submerged cross. ``It was supposed
to be the actual urine used, but it wasn't,'' Bourgeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there is a video that purports to be the work of
British artist Tracey Emin, showing her taking a shower while
menstruating. But another naked woman is on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jesus with a condom is attributed to Chris Ofili, the
artist whose ``Holy Virgin Mary'' painting is adorned with elephant
dung at the Brooklyn museum. Despite the label, it is meant to be
taken as the pretend response of Ofili to the controversy created
by his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people understand and some people don't,'' Bourgeau said.
And so in a post-modern spectacle of its own, art pretending to be
that of controversial artists of the past has become controversial
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Beal, who said he turned down the ``Sensation'' exhibit while
director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said that it was
sometimes appropriate for museums to show art likely to offend, but
that it was not warranted in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid somebody might be offended _ nobody had been
yet,'' said Bourgeau, who said few people had seen the exhibit.
``We've got this huge controversy over work no one's ever seen.''

INTERNET BANKING SERVICES TO MERGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Internet banking services provider Digital
Insight announced Monday it will buy rival nFront Inc. for $439
million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Atlanta-based nFront is expected to add to
Digital Insight's earnings immediately and shorten its estimated
time to profitability by three months, said Kevin McDonnell,
Digital Insight's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a good deal for both of the companies,''
McDonnell said. ``It combines two very complementary companies and
gives us excellent market coverage out of the box with a very
strong product offering.''
</P>
<P>
   NFront's primary customer base is small banks, while Digital
Insight's stable of customers includes mostly credit unions,
McDonnell said. The combined company has about an even number of
banks and credit unions as customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Insight, which went public in October at an initial
offering price of $15 per share, ended trading Monday down more
than 20 percent at $39.9375 per share.
</P>
<P>
   NFront's stock gained on the merger announcement, adding 12
percent of its value to close at $21 per share.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said he is not concerned about Monday's dip in Digital
Insight's stock price. The company maintains a favorable long-term
view of the stock price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The combined entity will operate as Digital Insight and be
headquartered in Calabasas, with operations continuing in nFront's
Atlanta offices.
</P>
<P>
   John Dorman, who is chairman of the board, president and chief
executive officer of Digital Insight, will serve as the company's
CEO and chairman of the board. Tripp Rackley, nFront's chairman and
CEO, will become the new entity's president and a member of the
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors will consist of five Digital Insight
directors and two nFront directors. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MR. BARAK'S SUMMONS TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an audience of American Jewish leaders the other
night, Ehud Barak chose the ancient words of Ecclesiastes, ``there
is a time for war and a time for peace.'' It was a particularly apt
quotation. As a former general and a former foreign minister under
Shimon Peres, Barak has seen his share of warmaking and
peacemaking. Now, as Israel's prime minister, he well knows that
the next few months offer a rare and perhaps fleeting opportunity
for clinching a Middle East peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has no illusions about the risks and difficulties ahead.
He understands that a written agreement cannot by itself assure
lasting peace. But he rightly recognizes that a quick and
successful conclusion to negotiations with the Palestinians as well
as future talks with Syria on Lebanon and the Golan Heights are
essential steps on the longer road to true peace that would leave
Israel stronger domestically and internationally
</P>
<P>
   Several factors combine to make this moment so crucial. After
100 years of bitter and unforgiving conflict, Israel and the
Palestinians now have leaders with the vision to see that for one
side to win, the other need not lose. Barak and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, have come to understand that their own
fates, and those of their peoples, are now intertwined in a
potentially positive way.
</P>
<P>
   From the Israeli side, that new reality was affirmed in the
election that brought Barak to power last spring. He proceeded to
build a broad new peacemaking coalition out of Israel's fractured
political parties, and set early deadlines for preliminary
agreements with the Palestinians and Syria. Even the defeated Likud
Party of the former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, now
recognizes that Israel is committed to yield at least part of the
West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Barak recognizes that Israel will be better off if it can reach
an agreement with the Palestinians before Arafat, who looks
increasingly frail, yields power to his successor, who is as yet
unknown. As difficult as Arafat has been for Israelis to deal with
in the past, no other Palestinian leader today has the political
authority to make the painful compromises necessary for completing
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Additional urgency comes from the approaching end of the Clinton
presidency. While the next occupant of the White House may prove as
committed to promoting Mideast peace as President Clinton has been,
the coming American election season will make it harder for
Washington to take an active role in encouraging the two sides to
reach agreement. With these factors in mind, Barak's announced
timetable for reaching a broad understanding with the Palestinians
by mid-February of next year seems about right.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves fewer than 90 days to work out the basic features of
an agreement covering issues like Palestinian statehood and
boundaries, Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the rights of
Palestinian refugees. That is a daunting timetable. But with
fortitude on both sides it can be met.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A billboard labeled ``Countdown to History'' looms
over the Hollywood Park winner's circle these days, bearing the
career victory totals for Bill Shoemaker (8,833) and Laffit Pincay
(8,818 and counting).
</P>
<P>
   Each time Pincay wins a race, he strides to the board and hangs
a new number beside his name as a track photographer snaps his
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park and Santa Anita are having contests promising an
$8,834 prize to a fan who predicts the day and race when Pincay
passes Shoemaker. Further promotions revolving around Pincay's
record pursuit are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting exciting, especially on days like Wednesday, when
it seemed like old times, with the Panamanian riding in seven races
and winning three, the last by a neck in classic Pincay Power Play
style.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for ``the great man,'' as track announcer Michael
Wrona referred to Pincay in a plug for the contest between races
Thursday, it's as close to business as usual as he and his agent
can make it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with Pincay 15 wins from tying Shoemaker, trainers and
owners aren't lining up to book his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed at all,'' said agent Bob Meldahl, who has
booked Pincay's mounts since 1991. ``Nobody's expressed, `I'm going
to put you on all these 8-5 shots.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it'll change when he gets to seven or eight (from the
record).''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, people might be angling to have Pincay ride
!ital!their horse to the record.
</P>
<P>
   But if it doesn't happen that way _ if his winning opportunities
don't increase in the next few weeks _ it appears that will be all
right with Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I don't ride seven, eight horses a day. It's too
demanding,'' Pincay said after his triple on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The only luxury in riding a full card is that Pincay could eat
100 more calories at dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, living on 750 calories a day to maintain his 117-pound
riding weight, Pincay feels stronger riding four or five a day.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he rides fewer than that because fields at Hollywood Park
are typically small, and competition for mounts is as keen as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep it to three or four (a day),'' Meldahl said
in the Hollywood Park racing office Thursday morning. ``He's
fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without extra chances, Pincay is riding as well as he has
in years. He has passed the 140-win mark in 1999, already his best
season since '95.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at the rate that put him third in the jockey
standings at the Oak Tree meet, the countdown to history would end
Wednesday, Dec. 29, at Santa Anita. That happens to be Pincay's
birthday _ the day he has said he'd like to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at his 1999 pace, he'd get the record on
Friday, Dec. 31, the fifth day of the Santa Anita season. Then
Pincay might have to allow himself half a glass of champagne that
night.
</P>
<P>
   If he kept winning at his recent pace _ 15 victories in the past
12 racing days, including one Thursday _ he would blow past
Shoemaker on Sunday, Dec. 5. That's practically impossible, though,
because Pincay is scheduled to be in Panama Dec. 2-5 to be honored
at a Latin American jockeys' competition.
</P>
<P>
   Meldahl said a couple of out-of-town stakes assignments later in
December are possible as well. Although a win is a win wherever it
happens, such trips could slow him down simply by reducing his
number of mounts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Pincay might be helped along if, as usual,
other veteran riders take vacations in December.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's asking for help. Business as usual has always been
good enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest with you, I don't think Laffit would
want it any other way,'' Meldahl said. ``He wants trainers to give
him good horses. But he's never in his life asked for anything
special, and he doesn't expect it now.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Intimidation by militias linked to the
Indonesian military is preventing tens of thousands of East
Timorese refugees from returning home from camps in West Timor, a
senior American diplomat said Monday on a tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. representative at the United
Nations, which took over the civilian administration of East Timor
when Indonesia ratified the territory's vote for independence, said
in a telephone interview that international relief experts were
losing a crucial information battle to the roving pro-Jakarta gangs
that lost out in East Timor and are now operating freely in West
Timor, an Indonesian province.
</P>
<P>
   After the overwhelming vote for independence in August, the
militias waged a campaign of violence in East Timor, driving many
people into hiding or into seeking refuge across the border in West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militia are using two core tactics to prevent the refugees
from going home,'' Holbrooke said from Dili, the East Timorese
capital. ``One is physical intimidation, but the more serious one
is disinformation. They have told the people that there is still
fighting in East Timor, that Australian troops will rape the women
and that they can't go back because Xanana Gusmao will kill them or
take retribution.'' Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the East Timorese
independence leader, is widely known to Timorese by his pen name,
Xanana.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the office of the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees was ``not yet on top of the situation.'' He said he and
the U.N. administrator, Sergio Vieira de Mello, would ask Gusmao to
make a reassuring videotape on Tuesday to be shown to the refugees.
Monsignor Carlos Ximenes Belo, the Nobel Peace laureate who is a
spiritual leader of the East Timorese, will also be approached,
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke compared the militiamen, some of whom he saw wearing
Indonesian army T-shirts, to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who
terrorized Cambodian refugees in Thailand in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these camps to become permanent,'' Holbrooke
said of the settlements in West Timor. ``It is a truism of all
refugee camps that the longer people remain refugees, the less
likely they are to return. These people should go back immediately.
But they're scared.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Holbrooke helped to arrange an agreement on border
security between Indonesian military commanders and the Australian
officer, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, who commands the international
peacekeeping force in East Timor. Matan Ruak, the deputy commander
of East Timor's former rebel army, Falantil, also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Kris Janowski, the spokesman for the high
commissioner for refugees, said the agency's staff members had been
assaulted and stoned trying to help refugees leave the camps. He
said officials, who have tried radio broadcasts to get information
to refugees, were forced to use ``hit and run'' techniques to get
them out of camps _ driving up and racing to load as many people as
possible into a vehicle before the militias intervene.
</P>
<P>
   About 90,000 East Timorese have returned home, leaving between
100,000 and 150,000 displaced people in West Timor, not all of whom
want to go back. The Indonesian government is being asked to
resettle those refugees elsewhere in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and other experts say the Indonesian military, stung
by the loss of East Timor, could turn West Timor, an undisputed
Indonesian province, into a festering crisis for Indonesia, the
United Nations and possibly Australia, which is leading the
peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
   A long conflict in West Timor could cost Indonesia the
international support that it needs at its most critical point, a
British expert on Southeast Asia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is a very, very sick country,'' Peter Carey of
Oxford University told an Asia Society audience in New York on
Monday. ``It needs to be in a process of intensive care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the country would have to be rebuilt with a kind of
Asian Marshall Plan _ a more comprehensive aid package than those
provided normally by the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Carey, a history professor and the author of numerous books
on the region, said outsiders would have to understand that the
situation could get worse in West Timor even as camps are emptied,
depriving the militias of important power bases. The Indonesian
army and its East Timorese supporters are in effect making their
last stand there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in West Timor is very insecure,'' he said, ``and
very insecure people will do very violent things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., used a
budget amendment to tie all future military sales and cooperation
with the Indonesian military to a list of demands that include the
return of the refugees to their homes and the prosecution of all
members of the armed forces who aided the attacks on East Timorese
since the August referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that late last week in Jakarta he told Indonesian
government leaders _ including President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is
known by a nickname, Gus Dur _ that ``Indonesia's international
standing is being clobbered by what was happening in the camps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The civilian leadership, from President Gus Dur on down _ and
particularly the attorney general and the defense minister _ all
wanted us to put public pressure on their own military to solve
this problem,'' said Holbrooke, who has been traveling with Stanley
Roth, assistant secretary of state for Asia and the Pacific, and
Robert Gelbard, the American ambassador to Indonesia. ``They did
not regard this as outside interference. They encouraged it. They
welcomed it. They asked us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesians are much more concerned about Aceh than about
West Timor,'' Holbrooke said, referring to the independence
movement in their troubled Aceh province. ``We told them we want to
get West Timor settled because we also are concerned in the long
term about Aceh and the rest of Indonesia.''

IS WELLPOINT POISED FOR RUSH MERGER?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- On the day that WellPoint Health Networks Inc.
announced it had enrolled its 5 millionth member in California, the
company declined to comment on a report that it is about to buy the
largest health maintenance organization in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint, the nation's fifth-largest HMO,
also said it now has 120,000 members in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Crain's Chicago Business reported Monday that WellPoint is
expected to purchase Chicago's largest health maintenance
organization, Rush Prudential Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at between $225 million and $290 million, could
be announced as early as this week, Crain's said. The merger would
add Rush Prudential's 380,000 members to WellPoint's nearly 7.2
million medical and approximately 30.6 million specialty members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wellpoint has no comment on the report,'' said company
spokesman Larry Bryant. Officials at Rush Prudential could not be
reached for comment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber analyst William S. McKeever said the purchase of
Rush Prudential would be in line with WellPoint's strategy to
expand its business into other areas of the country. McKeever has
rated WellPoint Health a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WellPoint on Monday announced two key enrollment
milestones. The company's California subsidiary, Blue Cross of
California, now has 5 million members enrolled in its health care
plans.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, Unicare Life and Health Insurance Co., the
national operating subsidiary of WellPoint Health, announced that
its enrollment in individual health plans reached the
120,000-member mark. Bryant said in four years, Unicare has become
the largest insurer of individual polices in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This growth shows people really appreciate and value the
choice our plans offer to our members across the country,'' Bryant
said. WellPoint's enrollment has climbed by an average of 900,000
members annually since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint stock closed at $63.375, down $1.1875, Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. &QL;

OHSA REACHES TO HELP WORKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Labor Department on Monday proposed new,
far-reaching rules aimed at curbing job-related back and repetitive
stress injuries by forcing employers to alter work environments to
better fit the physical limitations of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials estimate the new rules would affect 27 million
workers at 1.9 million work sites across the country and could
spare an estimated 300,000 employees annually from painful
musculoskeletal disorders such as back injuries and carpal tunnel
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are compelled to act,'' said Charles Jeffress, assistant
secretary of Labor and head of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. ``Employees are getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would apply ergonomics, a relatively young science
that attempts to adapt assembly lines, office furniture and other
working conditions to better suit the worker, to help employees
avoid work-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.8 million U.S. employees, from cashiers to poultry
workers, nurses to mail sorters, suffer musculoskeletal injuries
each year on the job, Labor officials said. About 600,000 are hurt
seriously enough to require time off from work.
</P>
<P>
   Such injuries can prevent a victim from performing even simple
tasks such as combing hair or pushing a shopping cart. Women
experience a disproportionate share of these injuries, including 70
percent of carpal tunnel cases and 62 percent of tendinitis cases.
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials estimate complying with the new rules would cost
U.S. businesses about $4.2 billion a year. Employers, regulators
figure, would spend an average $150 per work station each year to
address ergonomic problems. And they estimate that by addressing
ergonomic problems, employers could save more than $9 billion
annually in workers' compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the smart thing to do because good ergonomics is good
economics,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But business leaders scoffed at the administration's cost
projections. Kevin Burke, a lobbyist for the Food Distributors
International, a trade group representing 242 grocery wholesale and
food service distribution companies, called the government's
estimates ``absolutely ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke pointed to a study that suggested his industry alone would
incur $26 billion in costs the first year and $6 billion annually
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups vowed to fight the proposal, both on Capitol
Hill and in the courts, if necessary. They criticized the new rules
as being too broad and too vague, and they blasted Labor Department
officials for failing to wait until after the National Academy of
Sciences completes an on-going study on ergonomics and job-related
injuries before moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, they're afraid of what the results may be,'' said
Randy Johnson, vice president of labor policy for the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Burke conceded, however, that even if the National Academy
throws its support behind the proposed rules, business interests
plan to fight in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Food Distributors International does not need OSHA's help
on how to run our warehouses safely,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ergonomics rules are targeted primarily at
manufacturing jobs and those occupations requiring manual handling
such as lifting and carrying.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines would grandfather in companies that have their
own ergonomics programs _ currently about 28 percent of all
workplaces in general industry.
</P>
<P>
   And they would allow a company that experiences a work-related
injury to provide a ``quick fix'' to a problem area without
implementing a full ergonomics program, as long as the employer
eliminates the hazard within 120 days and does not suffer a similar
injury within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solutions are usually simple,'' Jeffress said. ``They're
obvious and relatively inexpensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals also would ensure that workers who are forced to
take time off work because of musculoskeletal injuries incurred on
the job receive 90 percent of their pay and 100 percent of their
benefits. Employees transferred to lighter duties would be
guaranteed full pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations as proposed would not apply to the agriculture,
construction or maritime industries, three sectors with long
histories of work-related injuries. ``We will address them at a
later time,'' Jeffress said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials plan to hold at least three hearings on the
proposals next year. Herman said she hopes to have a final rule
published by the end of next year, with the new regulations to take
effect in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement was but the latest salvo in an
eight-year-long guerrilla war between the Labor Department and
business interests over an ergonomics rule.
</P>
<P>
   By unveiling the proposed rules just three days after lawmakers
left town for the holidays, the Clinton administration has thrown
down a political challenge to a Republican-controlled Congress
hostile to any new ergonomics rule.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed a bill which would force regulators
to wait until the National Academy of Sciences completes its report
before publishing rule changes, while Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
believes he has enough support for a similar measure in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is ``almost thumbing its nose at Congress' intent,''
the Chamber's Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders applauded the administration's decision to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite an unrelenting and mean-spirited campaign by big
business groups and anti-worker members of Congress to block these
important protections, the public will finally have a chance to be
heard,'' John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said Monday.

U.S. PROSECUTOR ASKS COURT TO OVERSEE BOXING GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Adds 7 new grafs at end, starting with ``Opponents of the IBF
...'') 
(lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In the first attempt by federal law enforcement
officials to take over a private sports organization, the U.S.
attorney's office asked a federal judge on Monday to appoint a
monitor to run the International Boxing Federation, whose leaders
were indicted early this month on racketeering and bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutors' request is granted in a hearing scheduled
for Tuesday, the IBF would become the first sports group to join a
collection of organizations, including the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Fulton Fish Market in New York,
that have been taken over by the courts amid allegations of
corruption and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   In making the request in a civil lawsuit, the prosecutors asked
that Zachary Taylor, a former U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., be
appointed as the monitor. He would have subpoena power and a
sweeping mandate to restructure the organization and to replace all
its top officials, with the overall goal of changing the way the
organization does business.
</P>
<P>
   The boxing federation, with headquarters in East Orange, is the
only U.S.-based organization that ranks boxers and sanctions
championship bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the action are expected to raise fears that federal
prosecutors and judges are trying to establish themselves as the
equivalent of boxing czars in the absence of any congressional
mandate. But for those who have long criticized the IBF and other
boxing ranking groups as corrupt and manipulated by a few
well-placed people in the industry, the request is likely to be
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit, filed by U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary, the
chief federal prosecutor for northern New Jersey, comes nearly
three weeks after a federal grand jury indicted the four top
officials of the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-count indictment accused the officials of soliciting
bribes from fighters and promoters to move boxers up in the
rankings. Such rankings, whether given by the International Boxing
Federation, the World Boxing Council or the World Boxing
Association, allow fighters to qualify for bouts with television
proceeds that can run into millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is the first time that government has sought to
take control of a sports organization,'' Cleary said at a news
conference announcing the civil action. ``Along with the indictment
of November 4, this constitutes a devastating one-two punch to the
IBF, which we seek to resurrect as an organization free of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Lee Sr., the IBF president, who was among the
officials indicted, called the latest action by Cleary's office
unfair and said it would create turmoil in boxing. Lee said the
request for a court-appointed monitor amounted to saying that he
and his three co-defendants in the federal racketeering case were
guilty before they had gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little heavy-handed and they are out to make it
appear that I am guilty until proven innocent,'' he said in an
interview. ``If I am convicted, it's another story. But to come in
and create this kind of turmoil looks like something that is
orchestrated to create problems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gerard Lynch, a professor at Columbia University's School of
Law, said that the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act of 1970 provided a powerful tool for criminal prosecutions by
the federal authorities and also created a number of civil
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The law permits the government, with the approval of a judge, to
intervene immediately in the affairs of a business or union when
there is concern about the disposition of assets. That the leaders
of a business or a union are under criminal indictment is important
in such cases, but it is not the only factor that determines
whether a judge appoints a court monitor.
</P>
<P>
   These civil racketeering actions have been criticized in the
past by the affected unions, which have complained that such
actions give prosecutors and judges the authority to make policy
that is usually reserved for Congress. Lynch said that some critics
of the tactics used by Cleary's office may argue that prosecutors
are trying to enter an area where Congress has refused to take
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' he said, ``U.S. attorneys have been known to bring
cases such as this that are designed to impact whole industries.''
Lynch recalled drives against white-collar crime, including
securities fraud on Wall Street, by Rudolph Giuliani when he was
the U.S. attorney in New York in the 1980s. ``I'm sure that the
primary position of the prosecutor's office here is that they are
not trying to regulate boxing but are trying to clean up corruption
and crime wherever they find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the IBF like Pat English, the lawyer for Main
Events, one of the largest boxing promotion companies, said that
the allegations against the federation. were so egregious as to
demand intervention of the kind proposed by Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter Bob Arum, president of Top Rank Boxing, another
vocal critic of the IBF, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic and believe that this is exactly what should
happen,'' he said. ``Nobody wants the government involved, but in
this case the situation is so bad that the only way to deal with it
is to have someone come in who has no ax to grind.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed monitor, Carter, served six years as the chief
federal prosecutor in New York for Long Island, Brooklyn and
Queens, before leaving this summer to enter private practice. In
one well-known case, he obtained the conviction of two police
officers in connection with the assault on Abner Louima. Carter
told The Associated Press that he had never attended a bout but
that he had watched boxing on television.
</P>
<P>
   Those named in the indictment on Nov. 4 were Lee, 65, the
founder of the IBF; Robert Lee Jr., 38, his son and aide; Donald
William Brennan, 86, former chairman of the organization's
committee on rankings; and Francisco Fernandez, the group's South
American representative, who is from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   They are charged with receiving $338,000 in payments from
managers and fighters to raise them in the rankings so that they
could qualify for better fights.
</P>
<P>
   One fight that figured in the indictment was the June 1995
heavyweight title bout between George Foreman, then the IBF
champion, and a previously unranked boxer, Axel Schulz. The
indictment, without naming names, said IBF officials were paid
$100,000 in bribes.

EDITORIAL: THE TEAMSTER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times saidi in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 23:
</P>
<P>
   In winning a conviction last week against the former political
director of the Teamsters union for his role in an illegal campaign
finance scheme, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White,
provided an example of vigorous law enforcement _ and a sharp
contrast to Attorney General Janet Reno's desultory pursuit of
campaign finance abuses by President Clinton's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters official, William Hamilton, was convicted on fraud
and conspiracy charges stemming from his role in helping to divert
close to $900,000 in union money to finance the re-election
campaign of the union's former president Ron Carey. Carey narrowly
defeated James Hoffa in the election, but federal monitors
overturned his victory after discovering the campaign finance
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   While five people have pleaded guilty to participating in
different aspects of the conspiracy to swap union contributions to
outside political groups in order to generate contributions to the
Carey campaign, Hamilton was the first person to be tried in the
scandal. Depending on Ms. White's next steps, he may not be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial the prosecution presented testimony linking two
other well-connected figures to the effort to raise money for Carey
_ the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer, Richard Trumka, and President
Clinton's friend and all-purpose fund-raiser, Terence McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses indicated that Trumka had worked with Hamilton
on a complex operation designed to funnel $150,000 to help the
Carey campaign. As for McAuliffe, he was described in testimony by
the Democratic National Committee's former finance director,
Richard Sullivan, as playing a role in promoting another scheme to
swap campaign funds between the Democrats and the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, according to Sullivan, who received a no-prosecution
agreement for his testimony, called for the Teamsters union to
channel $500,000 or more in soft money to various Democratic Party
committees in exchange for a Democratic donor's making a
contribution of at least $50,000 to the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this deal did not go through _ not, apparently,
because of any ethical misgivings but because Democratic officials
did not turn up a suitable donor. Ms. White's spokesman says the
investigation is continuing. McAuliffe's attorney insists his
client did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan's account is troubling. It should prompt Vice
President Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, for whom McAuliffe is
now raising money, to ask for a full explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, Hamilton's conviction has left Ms. White with some
judgment calls to make as to whether she has the evidence for
additional prosecutions. But this case already stands as an
exemplary change from the reluctance of Ms. Reno's Justice
Department to look into potential campaign law violations by
prominent Democrats.

CENSUS WORKERS MAY BE HARD TO FIND, OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with filling almost 900,000 jobs by next
spring, the U.S. Census Bureau expressed concern Monday about heavy
competition for workers in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kennwitt said he was ``reasonably
optimistic'' about finding the 860,000 temporary workers and fended
off Houston officials' criticism that the agency is not ready for
the national head count.
</P>
<P>
   Houston officials have accused the bureau of not moving fast
enough to ensure it has enough workers who are familiar with
minority neighborhoods and the languages spoken by residents.
</P>
<P>
   These concerns are ``slightly premature,'' Prewitt said. ``They
are bringing complaints ... about the census operation before all
the census operation has taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   To help with recruiting, the bureau has altered its hiring
practices somewhat since 1990, Prewitt said. For example, the
bureau is prepared to hire noncitizens with work permits, a
practice largely prohibited during the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is also looking to form partnerships with
corporations and employment agencies to beef up its recruitment
efforts, particularly among college students, homemakers or others
who want to supplement their income with a short-term, second job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say that we are on track with respect to the
recruitment effort, I don't mean to suggest that we are relaxed
about that,'' Prewitt said during a briefing in Washington. ``It is
a very tight labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   With the economy setting records, the jobless rate has been
holding steady near 4 percent, a level at which the nation is
considered fully employed. In some areas of the country,
low-paying, low-skilled jobs are going unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston _ where census officials want to hire 6,600 workers _
the jobless rate stands at 4.4 percent. Kristin Capp, census
manager in Houston, said the agency is preparing for a ``worst-case
scenario'' to ensure enough workers are in place for measuring the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Houston City Councilman John Castillo and others have been
skeptical about the bureau's readiness to ensure the accuracy of
the census by improving the count in minority neighborhoods. In
1990, only 56 percent of the heavily minority Houston population
participated in the census compared to 65 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is if you raise these alarms too early, then it's
premature, but if you wait until it's over, then you're too late,''
Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting the undercount problem partly depends on people
mailing back their forms, which the Census Bureau is trying to
encourage through a $167 million advertising campaign slated to
begin this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the equation, bureau officials acknowledge,
hinges on finding people who fail to respond to questionnaires they
receive by mail. This is accomplished with door-to-door interviews,
which will begin after the April deadline for returning census
forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (bureau) may need to dig a little deeper to compete in the
labor market,'' said Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the Texas Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, bureau officials said they want to fill 20,000
positions. In an economy with an unemployment rate of 4.6 percent,
officials said they realize they will need to distinguish
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are looking high and low for help, and we're no
different,'' said Donna Stovall, a Census Bureau recruiter in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall said the bureau will pitch schedule flexibility and
higher wages to lure applicants. In Houston and Harris County,
door-to-door interviewers will get $10.25 an hour, but wages could
vary in neighboring counties, Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that it may face an employment pinch, the bureau has
begun a recruiting pitch aimed at luring 150,000 Texas applicants
by next March in its effort to fill the 20,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really front loading our operation because the
challenges out there are extreme,'' Stovall said.

THE GREAT, GREATER OR GREATEST GRETZKY ENTERS HOCKEY HALL OF FAME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It will be up to future generations to decide whether
The Great One really was the greatest hockey player of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, Wayne Gretzky took his place among the
National Hockey League's greatest players with his induction into
the Hockey Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening's ceremony was a mere formality, given the 61
National Hockey League records Gretzky either holds or shares
following his 21-year career. The waiving of the mandatory
three-year waiting period for Gretzky was testament enough to how
great he really was.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky is keenly aware of the rich tradition he inherited and
lifted to a new level. As a teen-ager, Gretzky _ who grew up in the
nearby Brantford, Ontario _ spent countless hours in the old Hall
of Fame facility, soaking up the game's rich history.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was hoping was that one day I would get a chance to play
in the National Hockey League,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his ceremonial ring and blazer, Gretzky insisted
that his retirement did not mark the end of hockey history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gordie Howe retired, there had never been anyone like
Gordie Howe before, and along came Bobby Orr,'' said Gretzky, the
historian, citing the two other players most often mentioned as
candidates for hockey's greatest player ever. ``When Bobby Orr
retired, along came Guy Lafleur. You always have these great
players come along to carry the torch. I probably miss the game
more than the game misses me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was being modest, as usual. The game misses Gretzky
tremendously. So does his last team, the New York Rangers, on the
power play especially. But Monday, Gretzky again insisted he got
out at the right time, even if his father did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he could play another year,'' 61-year-old Walter
Gretzky said of his 38-year-old son. ``He told me, `Dad, you don't
understand. Every year at training camp, the other players get
bigger, faster, stronger and better. And I just get a year
older.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky said: ``I wish I could still play. I miss it
tremendously. But as I said before, I was going to retire one
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first learned of his Hall of Fame selection, Gretzky
said he immediately thought of Howe, Jean Beliveau and Orr, and how
he would be taking his place alongside them.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to provide his own list of hockey's greatest players,
Gretzky said four names immediately came to mind: Howe (``my
childhood idol''); Beliveau (``maybe one of the most elite athletes
in any sport''); Maurice (the Rocket) Richard (``for what he did
for the game, not only in Montreal, but in North America''), ``and
of course, Bobby Orr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two greatest players I ever saw were Bobby Orr and Gordie
Howe,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any one person is ever going to be bigger than
the game,'' he said. ``What I think I did do, I paved the way for a
lot of other players. I was told that I wasn't big enough, that I
wasn't fast enough, that maybe I wasn't strong enough. Now people
can say, `He made it, maybe I can make it, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's induction class included the league's longtime referee
in chief and vice president of officiating, Ian (Scotty) Morrison,
in the builder category, and Andy Van Hellemond in the
referee/linesman category. Van Hellemond refereed 19 of 20 Stanley
Cup finals before retiring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's enshrinement overshadowed the other inductees. But as
Van Hellemond said: ``Going in, in 1999, with No. 99, we'll always
be part of a trivia question: `Who were the other two?' As long as
they spell my name right, that's OK with me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of the surgery he underwent for a brain aneurysm in
1991, Walter Gretzky has retained little memory of his son's
accomplishments from the early 70s to the early 90s.
</P>
<P>
   He does remember sitting with Howe when Gretzky broke Howe's
record for career points. Walter Gretzky also remembers Dec. 30,
1981, the night his son shattered the record for the quickest 50
goals by scoring his 50th in his 39th game.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky had phoned home after the game, saying, ``I got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father replied, ``What took you so long?
</P>
<P>
   But, said Canada's most famous father, ``I wasn't supposed to be
here tonight.'' Walter Gretzky nearly lost his life when Wayne was
3 in an accident at his job as a telephone repairman. ``I'm not
cheated. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Walter and Wayne Gretzky both had a chance to live
out a dream. Wayne Gretzky was asked if he now had a new dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I could come back and play again like I did when I was
20,'' the Great One said. &QL;

SBC WILL TRANSFER RESIDENTIAL INTERNET CUSTOMERS TO PRODIGY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc., the local telephone giant, said Monday
that it would transfer all of its residential Internet customers to
the Prodigy Communications Corp., the online service that has long
been overshadowed by America Online, in return for a 43 percent
stake in Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, which does business as Ameritech, Pacific Bell and
Southwestern Bell, said Monday that Prodigy had agreed to assume
day-to-day management of SBC's 650,000 residential and
small-business Internet customers. SBC also said it had agreed to
make Prodigy its exclusive Internet service for consumers and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Prodigy's market value Monday of almost $2 billion, the
43 percent stake taken by SBC would be worth about $900 million.
Prodigy's current primary shareholders, Telmex of Mexico and Carso
Global Telecom, will hold about one-third of Prodigy. SBC will
control only three of the nine seats on Prodigy's board, but the
company will have a veto over major acquisitions and key executive
hires.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, SBC said it would spend $6 billion to deploy
high-speed Internet systems throughout its service region, which
covers more than one-third of the United States population. SBC
intends to deploy a technology called digital subscriber line, or
DSL, which uses standard telephone wires to transmit digital data
at speeds many times faster than those using normal modems.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is known as one of the best-run regional Bell phone
companies, and the DSL announcement reflected the company's
confidence that it can profit from the exploding demand for
Internet access, particularly at high speeds. But none of the Bells
have had wild success as retail Internet providers, perhaps because
their brands are so throughly associated with voice telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's deal, SBC agreed to market Prodigy's service
exclusively and to deliver 1.2 million new customers to Prodigy,
based in White Plains, over the next three years. If Prodigy
consumers use high-speed DSL lines, Prodigy will pay SBC for the
use of those lines. Consumers who use normal lines will almost
always be able to choose an independent Internet provider.
</P>

   SBC executives said Monday that not only would the deal give
them access to Prodigy's brand but it would also give them access
to Prodigy's stock as a potential currency for future acquisitions.
SBC's stock generally trades as a multiple of the company's
projected per-share earnings. Because of the potential for
dilution, that can make it difficult to use SBC stock to acquire
high-flying Internet companies that may not have earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shields us from significant earnings dilution if we
decide we want to grow that business substantially,'' Stephen A.
McGaw, an SBC managing director for business development, said in
an interview. Referring to a widely used tool for valuing stocks,
he added, ``If you run a discounted cash flow of some of these
Internet companies, you can't come near to what's ascribed in the
market. Having a currency there is a big help.''

REGULATORS SEE NEED FOR RULES OF THE ROAD FOR ONLINE TRADING
FIRMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online brokerage firms are the hot rods of Wall Street,
providing fast and cheap access to stock market investors every
trading day. Now, securities regulators want these firms to install
seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   After months of inquiries into the practices of the nation's
online brokerage firms, securities regulators in Washington and New
York issued weighty reports on the industry Monday, identifying
lapses in investor protection at many online operations and
offering suggestions about how to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the office of Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York state attorney
general, are an attempt by securities regulators to bring some
order to the fractious online brokerage business, which has
transformed the way investors buy and sell stocks. Until now, much
of this change, driven by technological advancements, has been
watched by regulators from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of the reports recommended new rules for the
online industry, they telegraph to the brokerage community a
regulatory commitment to online investor protection.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Unger, the SEC commissioner who wrote the report, said in
a statement: ``I think it may still be premature for extensive
rulemaking in this area, but the report will allow the commission
to focus upon and consider the most vital issues concerning online
brokerage.''
</P>
<P>
   By the second quarter of this year, investors had opened about
9.7 million online brokerage accounts, almost three times the
number in force in 1997. Online trading volume has grown, the SEC
said, from fewer than 100,000 trades a day in mid-1996 to more than
half a million three years later.
</P>
<P>
   This explosive growth, according to the regulators, has made the
nation's stock market much more accessible to investors. But the
popularity of online investing, Spitzer's report said, ``also poses
unique risks to the public, and presents tough challenges to
regulators charged with ensuring the integrity of the trading
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's report, the result of nine months of inquiries into
the practices of seven firms in five states, concluded that online
brokerage firms hyped their technology and services, contending
that they provide direct and immediate trade execution while
downplaying the risks of computer system breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report found that many firms do not update
customer account information regularly enough to provide accurate
readings on investors' margin accounts. That has allowed investors
to buy stocks using money they thought was in the account when in
fact they had none.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Spitzer's investigators reported that online
investors were able to buy stocks in their individual retirement
accounts that exceeded the value of those accounts. Both of those
findings gave substance to the fears of some market observers that
online brokerage firms will do anything to keep investors trading.
</P>
<P>
   A top concern of the SEC is that some online firms may try to
escape their obligation to ensure that investments that their
customers make are suitable for their circumstances. Suitability is
one of the main avenues of protection for investors under federal
securities laws; almost one-third of the arbitration cases filed by
investors with the National Association of Securities Dealers since
1995 involved investments alleged to be unsuitable for the
investors who bought them.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some online firms have argued that because their
customers make their own investment decisions, even if it is based
on research taken from the Web site, the firm need not consider
whether an investment is suitable to the investor.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mathison, a spokesman for the Charles Schwab Corp., said
Monday that the firm's executives were still digesting the
regulators' reports and he could not comment on their specifics.
But he said that existing regulation adequately covers suitability.
``There's no need to separate out online investing for some sort of
differentiated or specialized regulation,'' Mathison said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the SEC's report identifies situations in which
online firms would have to meet suitability requirements. For
example, while an online firm that simply executes orders without
providing any research would not need to examine their customers'
trades for appropriateness, the report said that a firm that
published research should believe the data is plausible and that
the recommended investments ``may be appropriate for at least some
of its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis D. Lowenfels, a prominent securities lawyer at Tolins &AMP;
Lowenfels and an expert on suitability, said, ``Regulators have now
begun to address in-depth problems that new technology is raising
among investors. This is a sensible way to proceed. Any attempt to
set rigid rules when the industry is in such a state of flux would
be counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming individual firms, both reports maintained that
online brokerage firms need to tone down their promises of instant
market access and be more clear about the risks of system failures
or delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few years, online trading has revolutionized the
investment world,'' Spitzer said in a statement. ``With this new
technology comes the need for new `rules of the road' for both
investors and brokerage firms.''

TIFFANY'S OWNS THE BUILDING ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifteen years after Tiffany &AMP; Co. sold its flagship
store on Fifth Avenue, the jewelry maker has repurchased the
property, which was featured in Truman Capote's novel ``Breakfast
at Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   The luxury jeweler, whose robin's-egg-blue gift boxes are an
international status symbol, paid $94 million for the 10-story
building at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street.
Just as there are few bargains in Tiffany's bejeweled showcases,
the building did not come cheap: Tiffany paid $29 million more than
it got for the building in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``That location became known as the Tiffany corner,'' said Scott
Latham, managing director with CB Richard Ellis, a real estate
brokerage. ``It's a good defensive move. Their lease comes up for
renewal soon, and I think they were going to get clobbered. Of
course, $96 million is a major-league commitment to lock up that
location.''
</P>
<P>
   It was business as usual on Monday beneath the soaring
first-floor ceiling of Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building serves as a tangible symbol of our retailing and
merchandise initiatives throughout the world,'' Michael Kowalski,
president of Tiffany, said in a statement Monday night. ``In
financial terms, the tradeoff between the cost of leasing and the
cost of ownership is not expected to have any effect upon
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its symbolic value for Tiffany, the property was
something of a loser for the Japanese company, Daiichi Real Estate
Co., that sold it. Daiichi bought the building for $94.35 million
at the height of the real estate boom in the 1980s. But when the
recession hit in 1991, property values dropped by 50 percent or
more, leaving Japanese buyers like Daiichi with grossly overpriced
investments. The once eager buyers have been sellers ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese banks and insurance companies are trying to clean
up their balance sheets,'' said Jack Rodman, the director of
Asian-Pacific operations for Ernst &AMP; Young. ``None of these
investments was a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times last year, Ernst &AMP; Young changed the name
of its annual report ``Asian Investment in United States Real
Estate'' to ``United States Investment in Asian Real Estate.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1989, the Japanese went on a $7.4 billion shopping
spree in New York, buying trophy properties like Rockefeller
Center. That spawned a xenophobic reaction from critics who decried
the sell-off of American landmarks. But New York trophies lost
their luster when the recession hit Japan and New York real estate
almost simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it was not a profitable shopping trip,''
said Richard Baxter, a senior managing director at Insignia/ESG
Capital Advisers. ``The Germans are now the largest buyers of real
estate, but unlike the 1980s, everything trading today has some
economic justification.''

BUSH AVOIDS QUESTIONS ABOUT EXTRA DPS CHARGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATHAM, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush dodged questions Monday
about why he has refused to pay for the extra costs incurred by his
state security guards during his Republican presidential bid even
though he is returning part of his salary to Texas taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to talk to the DPS about what their charge is and
what their mandate is,'' Bush said. ``The Department of Public
Safety has got a charter, and that is to keep me safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The DPS earlier this month released records showing it had
incurred $1.8 million in expenses this year to protect Bush. That
is six times more than the agency spent during his re-election
campaign last year and 11 times more than it spent protecting Bush
in his least-expensive non-election year.
</P>
<P>
   When the question of his security first came up in July, Bush
announced he was returning to the state the $316 he normally would
earn each day as governor even if he was campaigning outside of
Texas. Bush said Lt. Gov. Rick Perry also gets that pay any day
when Bush is out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that one of the reasons he decided not to take
federal matching campaign funds this summer was because he did not
want taxpayers to support his primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reason but not the main reason,'' Bush said Monday.
``The reason I didn't take federal matching money, taxpayer
matching funds, is because I'm running against somebody who has
unlimited money to spend. I'm not going to let happen to me in the
state of New Hampshire what happened to Bob Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was referring to millionaire Steve Forbes, who largely
self-financed his 1996 campaign and is doing so again this year.
Dole's campaign suffered early in the 1996 primary campaigns
because he was operating under state-by-state spending limits
imposed on candidates who take matching funds. Forbes, who like
Bush this year, rejected the matching funds, did not have to comply
with the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also repeated that he will not meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans, a gay rights Republican group. One of Bush's GOP
rivals, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, met with the group, and Forbes
has said he is willing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly disagree with them on issues such as gay
marriage,'' Bush said, adding that he would accept financial
contributions ``and votes'' from members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're for me. I welcome people from all walks of life
into my campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign affairs, Bush was asked under what circumstances he
would commit troops to the Middle East. Bush said it would require
a circumstance such as the one that led his father, former
President Bush, to launch the Persian Gulf War when Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our economic interests are threatened, something akin to
what happened in Kuwait, or if our friend Israel _ the security of
Israel is threatened,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor spent most of his day campaigning in the first
primary state of New Hampshire, finishing with a speech to a
standing-room-only crowd of about 350 people at Brown's Lobster
Pound in Seabrook, N.H. He acknowledged that some New Hampshire
voters may have been upset when he missed a debate last month to be
with his wife, Laura, as she received an award from Southern
Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, I missed the first debate. That's the last debate
I'm going to miss,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush missed a debate Sunday in Arizona. He is returning to
New Hampshire on Dec. 2 for his first debate with other Republican
presidential candidates. He also is scheduled to participate in a
Dec. 6 Arizona debate and one Dec. 13 in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as Bush toured the Timberland boot factory in Stratham,
one factory worker in a conference center meeting asked Bush how
his mother was doing, and he responded that she is full of advice
for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on one of those TV shows yesterday morning, `Face the
Nation,' after it was over, mother called me with a little
critique,'' said Bush, who actually appeared on `Meet the Press.'
</P>
<P>
   One factory worker asked Bush if he was sincere in his promise
to provide an additional $1 billion for military pay increases and
as recruitment incentives. The man, whose brother is in the
military, said such promises in the past have fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question is: Does ol' George W. mean what he's
saying? If there's any doubt in your mind or the voters' minds that
I'm just up here talking, you shouldn't vote for me,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said part of the money from his plan would come from
savings created by a strategic overhaul of nation's weapons
systems.

MCANN HAS THINGS TO PROVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Quarterback Ryan McCann played well against USC in
the first start of his career but not well enough to avoid a
spring-practice duel with fellow freshman Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ryan had had an outstanding game, it probably would have
really solidified his position (as the starter),'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said. ``But because of the interceptions, and he still has
some things to prove, it's only right to make it a competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't know that I'll name anybody (a starter) after
spring. That way, they'll work hard over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus started seven games before breaking his collarbone against
Washington. He completed 48.2 percent of his passes this season,
with seven touchdowns and nine interceptions. His collarbone is
expected to heal in two months. He'll have surgery this month to
tighten loose shoulder ligaments, but he expects to be ready by
April.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, of Westlake, was the fourth-string quarterback when UCLA
broke training camp, but he improved dramatically in the final
month as his understanding coalesced with his size and strong arm.
He played sparingly until the USC game and finished the season with
a 52.4 completion percentage, no touchdowns and three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, he's got a lot of tools,'' Toledo said. ``He just
needs time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Work to do: Sophomore tailback DeShaun Foster's sprained
ankle (and disappointing season) greatly increased the chance he'll
play four years. If Foster had dominated this season, then played
well next year, he might have declared for the 2001 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Foster rushed for fewer yards (375) than he did last year (673)
and ended the season with a crushing fumble against USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on his year next year, but I don't think he's ready
to come out,'' Toledo said. ``He needs time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury really hurt him, but he needed to work harder
(last) summer. He needs to run more and lift weights with the
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Come one, come all: At his postseason press conference
Monday, Toledo promised competition for most positions in spring
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Three starters who missed most/all of the season _ receiver
Brian Poli-Dixon (broken wrist) and cornerbacks Jason Bell (painful
heel) and Marques Anderson (suspended) _ will compete for their
starting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bell and Anderson will have to beat (Ricky Manning
Jr.) out,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which redshirt freshmen appear ready to play, Toledo named
several: defensive tackle Rodney Leisle, guard Shane Lehmann,
defensive end David Ball, defensive end/linebacker Mat Ball,
linebacker Asi Faoa, tailback Akil Harris and receiver Jerry Owens,
of Newhall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not redshirt as many freshmen in the future,'' Toledo
said. ``Because of scholarship limits and injuries, you don't have
enough guys to go around.''

ALVIN COOX, 75, HISTORIAN OF RUSSIA-JAPAN FIGHT, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin D. Coox, a former professor of Asian studies at San
Diego State University who called attention to the importance of an
obscure but critical military campaign in World War II, died on
Nov. 4 in a hospice in San Diego. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Coox (pronounced cooks) died after a long illness, said a
spokesman for the University of San Diego, where he taught from
1964 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Coox wrote or collaborated on 10 scholarly books. His reputation
rested on his two-volume 1,200-page magnum opus, ``Nomonhan: Japan
Against Russia, 1939'' (Stanford, 1988). It told of Japan's
crushing defeat by the Soviet Union in 1939, when the two powers
fought over a few miles of barren land between Mongolia and
Manchuria.
</P>
<P>
   An elite Japanese division proved no match for Soviet tanks and
heavy artillery under the command of Marshal Georgi Zhukov. An
estimated 70,000 Soviet and Japanese soldiers died in the conflict,
which was decided in three battles over 10 days in August 1939 and
ended by thwarting the Japanese invasion of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   Coox argued that the defeat made Japan shy from fighting the
Soviet Union, as it had planned, and instead take aim at Pearl
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomonhan was one of the most important battles of World War
II, because it bloodied the Japanese, and they remained fearful of
the Soviet Union and decided that the Americans would be an easier
target,'' said Dr. Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy
Research Institute and former chairman of the Center for Chinese
Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It was a
classic blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it led to a determination of the policy pursued by the
Axis powers in World War II. The genius of Professor Coox was to
recognize what a critically decisive battle it was to World War II.
It was every bit as important as Stalingrad.''
</P>
<P>
   Coox told colleagues that his book on Nomonhan, which won the
Samuel Eliot Morison Prize from the American Military Institute,
was a result of 35 years of research and more than 400 interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he interviewed just about every living Russian or
Japanese veteran of Nomonhan that there was,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Japanese veterans thought so highly of the book that
they placed a copy in a Tokyo shrine to honor Japan's war dead.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin David Coox was born in Rochester, N.Y. He earned a
bachelor's from New York University and received a master's in
history and a doctorate in history and government from Harvard. In
the late 40s, he taught history at Harvard and was a senior
historian at the Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   His 15 years in Japan in the 50s and early 60s included six
years as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Air Force. In 1964,
he went to the University of San Diego in 1964. From 1985 to 1987,
he was an adjunct professor at the Naval War College there.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Hisako, of San Diego; a son, Roy, of
Escondido, Calif.; and three grandchildren.

REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, WANTING ONE OF THEIR OWN, DECIDED EARLY ON
BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Texas, Pa., Ohio, Utah, La., Mich., Okla., Mass.,
Mont., N.C.)  (nk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ More than one Republican governor looked at
making a presidential run this year, and there was a touch of envy
directed at the one who ultimately did. When Gov. Tommy G. Thompson
of Wisconsin decided against a campaign, he observed that his Texas
counterpart had a more famous name and more money, was
better-looking and came from a much bigger state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than those few little things,'' Thompson said, ``I'd
have been the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah puts it now, ``It became
pretty clear pretty early that the one among us on whom fate seemed
to be settling was George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bush emerged, the nation's Republican governors,
eager for a greater say in the affairs of the national party in
2000 and privately irritated with what they regarded as
congressional Republicans' bungling of public sentiment, had
largely concluded that the time had come to nominate one of their
own for president.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush has assembled a remarkably unified team from the ranks
of the Republican governors _ the chief executives of 31 states,
and of eight of the nine most populous _ with whom he frequently
consults for both campaign advice and policy ideas. Many of them
endorsed him long before he officially jumped into the race in
June, and led fund-raising drives that helped him amass more
campaign money than any other presidential candidate in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governors are united behind Bush not so much by
any firm ideological ties as by the concerns that all governors
share and by a common hope among the Republicans that, as Gov. John
Engler of Michigan put it, ``a Republican president in Washington
would be enormously helpful'' in reducing the power of the federal
government and granting more to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the governors' own ideologies range from the moderate
stances of Northeasterners like George Pataki of New York and
Christie Whitman of New Jersey to the staunchly conservative views
of some Westerners and Southerners like Mike Foster of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But any such differences are clearly being shelved, at least for
now, and a visitor to the recent meeting of the Republican
Governors' Association in this Southern California community might
well have confused the event with a Bush-for-President strategy
session. It was here that the governors gathered not only to
discuss campaign themes but also to vote their support for Bush,
the first such endorsement with a primary battle still under way in
the organization's 36-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The governors hold regular conference calls with Bush, and he
often refers to them as some of his closest friends in politics or
singles them out for praise in campaign speeches. One of them, of
course _ Jeb Bush of Florida _ is his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   That the governors could wind up playing so large a role says a
great deal about their popularity among the public. While a recent
New York Times/CBS News poll found that just 37 percent of
respondents approved of the way the Republican-controlled Congress
was handling its job, many Republican governors boast approval
ratings that are nearly twice as high. The governors are reaping
the benefits of a strong national economy, which has allowed them
to cut taxes and increase spending on popular programs at the same
time. They also seem to fare better than their congressional
counterparts because the public does not associate them with the
drive to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews at the meeting here, many governors said Bush had
brought a fresh political attitude to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically adopts the strategy that you concede no issue,
you concede no voter, you concede no region,'' said Gov. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania. ``Every voter's an opportunity. For too long,
there's been a notion that maybe we can win nationally if we can
put together the least common denominator: `Let's figure out how we
can get just enough to win.' And George's approach, my approach,
the approach of a lot of governors, is, `Hey, how do we put our
arms around this whole thing and get as many votes as we possibly
can?'''
</P>
<P>
   Engler, a vigorous Bush backer, said that as early as last year
he and his colleagues were holding informal talks about advancing a
governor as the party's next candidate for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there was discussion among the governors about the
advisability of leading with our strength in the next presidential
election,'' he said, in the kind of comment that reflects
continuing tensions between Republicans in the governors' offices
and Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, for all the reasons that Thompson well knew, quickly
emerged as the informal consensus choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't all go out and do our secret handshake and do a
vote,'' Engler said. ``That didn't happen. But there was just a
clear sense that George W. Bush would be a very good president and
a feeling, `Hey, let's go out and do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their shared outlook and familiarity with the man they have now
endorsed only enhance the prospect of payoffs for the governors:
cabinet posts, perhaps, should he win election, or maybe a spot on
the national ticket as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the governors say it is far too early to speculate on
the makeup of a ticket, and Bush, should he gain the nomination,
might well get advice to pick a running mate with congressional
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few of the governors are willing to promote the
idea of a vice-presidential nominee from among their own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ```Outside of Washington' works,'' said Gov. John G. Rowland of
Connecticut. ``A governor would be perfect,'' he added, before
suggesting his colleague from Pennsylvania: ``Tommy Ridge would be
great.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Whitman, who has been mentioned as a possible
vice-presidential candidate, said a congressional career was not so
vital a prerequisite as it used to be for a running mate of a
governor seeking the presidency: ``balance'' is simply no longer
deemed so crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't think the public is particularly enamored of
D.C. experience these days,'' she said. ``I think it is very
important to have had executive experience.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the governors promote themselves as more moderate and
more pragmatic than many congressional Republicans. Frank Keating
of Oklahoma, departing chairman of the Republican Governors'
Association, calls the states ``hothouses of experimentation'' in
which the governors are leading a ``solution revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North
Carolina, echoes the thought, noting for instance that it was the
states that took the lead in promoting the vast welfare overhaul
ultimately adopted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they had to virtually go out and get welfare reform
done,'' Beyle said of the Republican governors. ``They do not want
another U.S. senator or a national figure from the Republican Party
to be the leader in 2000. They want someone who has felt the fire
of being in the governor's chair.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The concerted effort on Bush's part was led by several
governors, including Engler, Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and
Marc Racicot of Montana, who, beginning early this year, called
colleagues around the country urging them to endorse him, even as
he was saying he would not make up his mind about running until
after the Texas legislative session ended in May.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio remembers getting a call from Engler but
replying that he would hold off since an Ohioan, Rep. John R.
Kasich, was in the race. ``Then the day after John dropped out'' in
July, ``Marc Racicot was on the phone,'' Taft recalled. ``And it
was, `OK, can you do it now?'''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Bush boomlet occurred in February at a meeting of the
National Governors' Association, where several other governors
announced for Bush. ``It was the only spontaneous thing I've seen
happen in RGA/NGA politics in five years,'' Rowland said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Others who had held off on shelving their national ambitions
eventually saw the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched George Bush come out of the blocks so fast,''
Thompson said. ``And as he did, I thought, `I better get on that
horse.''' Thompson, who calls Bush a ``wonderful candidate,''
endorsed him this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in Bush's favor was that many of the governors
had long links with the Bush family, dating from his father's run
for the White House starting in 1979. Ridge, for instance, led that
Bush campaign's effort in Erie County, Pa., and as vice president,
George Bush returned the favor with campaign help during Ridge's
successful run for Congress in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gov. Bush has done nothing to dampen speculation
that he might just tap a fellow governor to run with him if he wins
the nomination. He has even registered BushEngler, BushPataki,
BushRidge and BushWhitman as names for Web sites, though his
campaign says that it has reserved many other such names and that
no preferences should be read into the move.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though naturally parrying questions about a
vice-presidential selection, Bush certainly does nothing to rule
anybody out. During a two-day fund-raising tour of Pennsylvania in
June, when he and Ridge took a break to go for a run along the
Susquehanna River, he jokingly referred to Ridge as his ``jogging
mate.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Iowa in August, he ran into Thompson, who was helping to
promote his successful bid to win a straw poll there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Tommy T.!'' said Bush, throwing his arms around the man
who had wanted to run for the presidency himself but declined in
the face of the Bush juggernaut. ``Tommy T.,'' Bush said, ``he's
the best. I know how lucky I am to have him with me.''

SERGE LANG, 79, EXPERT ON SKIING WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serge Lang, a French sportswriter who helped create skiing's
biggest and most successful tour, the World Cup, died Sunday in
Sternenberg, in the Alsace region of France. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for
the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association in Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Lang began working as a journalist in 1940. During much of his
career, he was a reporter and columnist at the French daily
newspaper L'Equipe and the Swiss tabloid Blick. By the late 1940s,
he had become an authority on cycling, his personal passion, and
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Lang decided that skiing could become as
popular as cycling and its Tour de France, if marketed properly.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Bob Beattie, a television sports commentator and a
former head of the U.S. ski team, and a French skier, Honore
Bonnet, Lang brought together a few scattered ski races that were
only known by die-hards and called the circuit the World Cup. The
first season was the winter of 1966-67.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Cup is today one of the best-known sporting events
in the world because of him,'' Kelly said of Lang. ``He was a great
visionary and had a lot of passion. The sport also grew
tremendously after he started the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The three founders of the World Cup reportedly dreamed up the
idea late one night over a bottle of wine while waiting for
avalanche warnings to end and blizzards to clear. ``Actually, it
was over a lot of bottles of wine _ over a period of time, Beattie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said that the World Cup ``was a particularly large
factor in helping to popularize ski racing in the United States; it
brought the Europeans over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang was president of the International Ski Federation's World
Cup committee from 1973 to 1986. He also wrote an annual book of
skiing biographies and World Cup statistics, the Biorama, and
founded the Association of International Ski Journalists in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the organization until his death. In the
past few years, Lang also started a circuit, called Legends, for
former ski racing stars and older skiers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Patrick. &QL;

 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it was announced last week that Gucci had
finally closed its deal to buy Yves Saint Laurent for about $700
million in cash, there was a flurry of phone calls from journalists
in Europe and elsewhere to Gucci's chief press officer, Lisa
Schiek, in New York. They wanted to know one thing: Who was Mark
Lee?
</P>
<P>
   To a lot of people in the fashion world, and on Wall Street,
where news of the deal sent Gucci's stock up nearly 4 percent,
Saint Laurent is the ultimate prize. It is a label so steeped in
the history of the last 30 years that it has gathered meaning
beyond clothes. To be ``very Saint Laurent'' is to be not only
chic, with a ready knowledge of cut and seduction, but also modern.
</P>
<P>
   There are women who when asked to recall the 1970s will
invariably mention Saint Laurent. For women like Miuccia Prada, who
wore his clothes while distributing fliers for the Communist Party,
he alone showed them a new way to be women.
</P>
<P>
   He also meant something to Gabriella Forte. Putting aside her
long association with the house of Giorgio Armani and, more
recently, Calvin Klein, where she was president, Ms. Forte said,
``For my generation, I can't think of fashion without Saint
Laurent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor can one think of Saint Laurent without Pierre Berge, the
power behind the throne. Theirs is the defining business
partnership in fashion, the one by which others are measured, and
it was not out of arrogance that Berge once remarked that Saint
Laurent was ``a man of exceptional intelligence practicing the
trade of an imbecile.'' It is simply that Berge understood better
than most how to protect the genius of one while exploiting the
weakness of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Thus when Domenico De Sole, the chief executive of Gucci, let it
be known last week that the most venerated fashion house in Paris,
with ties to the government and establishment, would be run by an
American named Mark Lee, there was a collective ``Who?''' And as if
to underscore how anonymous Lee is, Gucci _ for whom Lee has
directed global sales since 1996 _ did not even have a prepared
biography of him.
</P>
<P>
   What is intriguing about Lee's appointment, aside from the fact
that it is the first at Saint Laurent to be announced by De Sole
and Tom Ford, Gucci's creative director, is that at 36 Lee has
inherited one of the most visible positions in French fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Ford will shape Saint Laurent's style and image, and
Gucci's successful team approach will be applied to management. But
it is Lee who succeeds Berge, who built Saint Laurent's name into
an international status symbol largely by force of his own
personality.
</P>
<P>
   As managing director of Saint Laurent, Lee will be in charge of
the day-to-day business of the house's ready-to-wear, perfume and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is not the first company to own part or all of Saint
Laurent. A succession of corporations and individuals, beginning in
1963 with J. Mack Robinson, an Atlanta investor who made his
fortune in used cars, have owned stakes in the brand. But Gucci is
the first to control it completely.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Berge will run only Saint Laurent
haute couture, which is still controlled by Artemis SA, a holding
company. It is not quite Elba, but for a man accustomed to calling
the shots, who 10 years ago was predicting the demise of couture,
it isn't the whole empire, either.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a serious, soft-spoken person who in 1980 came to Manhattan
from San Francisco to study film at New York University, is well
regarded by fashion insiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart,'' Philip Miller, president of Saks Fifth Avenue,
said, echoing similar comments by Ford and De Sole, who praised Lee
as a behind-the-scenes player whose knowledge of retailing helped
establish Gucci's handbags as hot accessories. De Sole said Monday
from Paris, ``If something makes sense, Mark implements it
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another quality that friends like Sandra Brant, the publisher of
Interview magazine, and Stephen Sills, the interior designer,
mention is a reserve backed by powers of observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very shy, yet he can repeat things I've said a year
before,'' said Sills, who decorated the upstate country house that
Lee shares with Ed Filipowski, a senior partner in the fashion
public relations firm KCD.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brant, a friend of Saint Laurent and Berge since the early
1970s, when they were frequently out with Andy Warhol, added:
``Mark is always listening, always watching. But more than that, I
sense he's someone who's genuinely moved by people who put
themselves on a line creatively, and I think this will make him a
great warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lee does seem to be a strategist. He was suitably cautious
during an interview last week from Paris, where he was meeting
Saint Laurent managers. He began his fashion career as a factotum
for a video company, and then joined Saks as an assistant Eursportswear buyer. This sounded mildly impressive, but Lee denied
that. ``I wasn't in the forefront,'' he said. ``I was more in the
basement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, after working briefly at Valentino, Lee was
hired by Ms. Forte to run Armani's collection business, which was
being pulled out of many department stores in a successful move to
build cachet for the brand. Ms. Forte recalled Lee's reaction when
she told him that her strategy was not to sell the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was totally devastated,'' Ms. Forte said with a
laugh. ``But what he learned was how to market a luxury brand. You
don't look for quick money. You plan every detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee followed that approach at Jil Sander and later at Gucci.
``You never focus on what you sell in the showroom, only what you
do at retail,'' he said. ``And that's the key to Gucci's success.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although old friends like Keith Scott, who worked with him at
Armani, and Sills see in Lee's reserve an alert mind, full of
references to fashion and obscure films, some find him inscrutable.
``He's difficult to read,'' a former colleague said. It's also hard
to weigh praise for Lee against his performance at Gucci, since
it's relatively easy to sell a brand that people want.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Saint Laurent, Lee doesn't conceal his awe. He
met the designer last week. ``It was extremely emotional for me,''
Lee said. ``He's a legend. He's Saint Laurent.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent is also one of the most profoundly intriguing
people in fashion, the center of gossip, speculation and reverie in
a small, strange world that is fading fast. He once said, ``At 21,
I entered a kind of stronghold of glory that's been the trap of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is hard-working and conscientious. He has in common with
Ford a respect for Saint Laurent and its culture, which will not be
lost on the Gucci management, whose designs already reflect Saint
Laurent's influence and are likely to bring fresh currency to the
label if Ford takes over the Rive Gauche ready-to-wear collection,
which seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But does anyone in this Ayn Rand age of managers and strategies
and incremental retailing understand what it took to remain in that
stronghold of glory?
</P>
<P>
   Lee sounds as if he's at least willing to try. ``My first
priority is to understand the existing organization,'' he said,
``to understand all that exists.''

HOWARD FERGUSON, 91, COMPOSER WHO COMPILED MUSICAL TEXTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howard Ferguson, a British musician internationally known for
his editions of early keyboard music and of Schubert's complete
piano works, died on Nov. 1 at his home in Cambridge, England. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and trained in
London, where he studied composition with R.O. Morris at the Royal
College of Music and had piano lessons privately with Harold
Samuel. He then set out on a career playing chamber music, and it
was with a chamber piece, his Octet of 1933, that he made his
reputation as a composer.
</P>
<P>
   His music, expertly craftsmanlike, seemed to distill the English
essence of Vaughan Williams and Gerald Finzi into forms and
textures more characteristic of the classical masters, especially
Brahms and Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he was associated with the pianist Myra Hess
in organizing daily recitals at the National Gallery. From 1948 to
1963 he taught composition at the Royal Academy of Music, where his
pupils included Richard Rodney Bennett, Susan Bradshaw and
Cornelius Cardew.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this time he continued to compose actively, his major
works including a Piano Sonata (1938-40), a Concerto for Piano and
Strings (1950-51) and two large-scale cantatas: ``Amore Langueo''
(1955-56) and ``The Dream of the Rood'' (1958-59). He then decided
he had said all he had to say as a composer and stopped.
Thereafter, he devoted his efforts to editorial work, producing
volumes of preclassical music and of Schubert that have become
standard texts the world over.
</P>
<P>
   In later years his creative achievements fell into neglect,
partly because of his retirement, partly because he was out of
fashion. His violin sonatas, which had been in Jascha Heifetz's
repertory, were unknown to younger musicians. But he lived long
enough to witness a revival of interest in his work in the 1980's
and to see almost his entire output recorded.

DEATHS OF LOBSTERS IN LONG ISLAND SOUND TIED TO TINY PARASITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Maine, Mass.)   By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYVILLE, N.Y. _ The mysterious deaths of hundreds of thousands
of lobsters in Long Island Sound this fall may have been caused by
a tiny parasite that is deadly to crustaceans but not a threat to
people, marine scientists in New York and Connecticut said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probable that the deaths of lobsters and crabs in the
Sound are the result of an infestation by a parasite known as a
paramoeba, which does not present a hazard to human life,'' said
Ernest Beckwith, director of the marine fisheries division of the
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Monday that the parasite was found in dead
lobsters and crabs collected within the last month and that tests
showed that the parasite was present in almost all of the
specimens.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the dead lobsters that fishermen have found in
their traps have been pulled from the western waters off Long
Island Sound. Lobstermen who ply the waters between here and
Greenwich, Conn., have reported crustacean death rates of up to 50
percent. They say the infestation now appears to be spreading
eastward, said Nicholas Crismale, president of the Connecticut
Commercial Lobstermen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people relying on incomes from this industry, and now
our lives are on hold,'' Crismale said. The industry has grown to a
$16 million-a-year business in recent years because of record
catches, according to managers of marine fisheries in New York and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said more research would be needed to determine whether
the paramoeba definitely caused the crustacean deaths this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and
the New York Department of Environmental Conservation have been
working with the National Marine Fisheries Services Laboratory in
Milford, Conn., to determine the causes of the lobster deaths,
which were described as the worst to hit Long Island Sound in
almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Marine biologists say an examination of water quality in Long
Island Sound and an evaluation of bottom sediment have so far
failed to identify any environmental conditions or toxins that
could explain the high mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
   As their next step, pathologists began injecting the paramoeba
Monday into parasite-free lobsters obtained from a Massachusetts
hatchery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have results from the tests from this control group in
about two weeks,'' Beckwith said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith cautioned, however, that although the parasite might be
the cause of the deaths, it could be a secondary infection in
crustaceans already weakened by another as yet undocumented cause.
He also said that parasite infestation or other causes of morbidity
and mortality in lobsters could be caused by changes in ecological
conditions in Long Island Sound, such as water temperature, that
need to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said the population of lobsters in Long Island Sound
over the last several years had exploded, providing lobstermen with
their best takes in decades. ``With so many lobsters, their natural
enemies may now be gaining ground, correcting the balance,'' he
said. ``Lobsters are not disappearing from the Sound, they are just
dropping back to more normal levels.''

FRANK E. TAYLOR, 83, BOOK PUBLISHER AND EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank E. Taylor, a longtime book publisher who was editor in
chief and general manager of the McGraw Hill Book Co.'s trade-book
division and publisher of Avon Books for the Hearst Corp., died on
Nov. 16 at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who also worked in the movie industry, was the producer
of the 1961 film ``The Misfits,'' starring Marilyn Monroe, Clark
Gable, Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift. The film was directed by
John Huston and written by Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's book-publishing career began in 1940 at Harper &AMP;
Brothers and spanned four decades. The authors he dealt with
included Vladimir Nabokov, Eldridge Cleaver, Marshall McLuhan,
Harold Taylor, Leo Rosten, Desmond Morris, Malcolm Lowry, Grace
Metalious, Miller, Alfred Kazin, Karl Shapiro, Richard Wilbur,
George Orwell and V.S. Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as editor in chief of Dell Books from 1952 to 1961
and publisher of Avon Books from 1963 to 1965, he held his high
posts at McGraw Hill from 1965 to 1970, when he said he was leaving
because of a company reorganization ``that pushed me aside to work
on special projects.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1965 interview Taylor said he did not believe in editors
interfering with writers.

NFL SEEKING TO BAN THE THROAT-CUTTING GESTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League has become increasingly angry with
players who make throat-slashing gestures after scoring a touchdown
or making a big play. Now, league executives are taking steps to
ban the gesture in what would be a stunning but politically tricky
move.
</P>
<P>
   The act of taking an imaginary knife and running it across the
throat as a way of celebrating, or taunting an opponent, has
increased in popularity in professional football this season. Some
players believe using such a display is cruel and unnecessary while
others think it is a harmless way of celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   What matters most are the beliefs of owners, general managers
and league executives. Many of them believe the gesture is violent
and bad for the game's image. There is also a concern, though
probably unwarranted, that the gesture is gang related.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has spent the past week examining ways to eliminate the
gesture from the field of play. The league concluded a player
pretending to slash his neck violated league protocol, specifically
the sportsmanship portion of the rule book which states, in part, a
lack of ``mutual respect'' or other unsportsmanlike conduct, which
includes ``abusive'' acts aimed at players, coaches or other
personnel, are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   This week the NFL will send a memo to each of its 31 teams,
asking them to remind the players of existing rules that prohibit
such behavior. Once players have been warned, game officials will
enforce that portion of the rules, flagging the player for a
15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. The player could also be
fined by the league office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the league goes through with this, they will have my
support, and probably 99 percent of my colleagues,'' said one
general manager, who asked not to be identified. ``It is an ugly,
violent thing to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore owner Art Modell said: ``When players do that,
it's just terrible. We do try to have a family-oriented game and we
don't need any nonsense to distract from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting worse,'' said Modell. ``On Sunday I was watching
a bunch of games and I saw players do it. We have rules in place
but we really need to crack down. The taunting, the theatrics, it's
bizarre. I hate it. A coach can't tell a player not to do it,
because that will make him do it more. But if something comes down
from the league, and it includes a penalty or fine, then players
listen. Then it will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has tried to reel in excessive celebration,
strengthening rules to stop dances in the end zone after
touchdowns. Players and the news media criticized the league for
trying to weed levity out of the game. The NFL was nicknamed the
``No Fun League.''
</P>
<P>
   The throat-slashing gesture, however, is trickier. Since most of
the players who make the motion are black, there will be those who
will claim the league is specifically targeting black players.
</P>
<P>
   The league insists that is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   What the NFL believes is that something needs to be done. An
increasing number of players, league officials believe, are making
the motion, including well-known names such as Tampa Bay's Warren
Sapp, the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson and Green Bay's Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   A recent high-profile example of the gesture raised the NFL's
ire to the boiling point and prompted the league to consider
immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   During the Jets game against New England last Monday night,
Johnson scored on a touchdown catch, and then made the slashing
gesture to the crowd in Foxboro, Mass. Television cameras caught
Johnson's act _ he was not penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said afterward that he did not mean the gesture as
anything other than a way to celebrate in what was an intense,
passionate game.
</P>
<P>
   Another example that irked the NFL happened this past Sunday and
involved one of the game's biggest stars in Favre. When Detroit
beat the Packers in Week 2, cornerback Robert Bailey flaunted the
cut-throat motion, irritating Green Bay players, including Favre.
</P>
<P>
   During Green Bay's 26-17 victory on Sunday, Favre threw a
touchdown pass, ran 20 yards up field to Bailey's vicinity and made
the gesture in his face. It was the second time Favre had taunted
the Lions with the gesture. The first time he was not penalized;
the second time he was, for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``They batted the ball down on fourth down and they were doing
one of these in our first game,'' said Favre, drawing his thumb
across his neck. ``That hurt. When you taunt, it's going to come
back to haunt. I'm not that kind of player but I was today, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Favre added, ``When I see guys do that, I usually always say,
`Those guys shouldn't do that. It looks bad.' And then I'm out
there doing it.''

DRIVE TO PUSH SEAT BELT USE BY CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police officers nationwide will be stepping up
enforcement of the laws on seat belts for children during this
Thanksgiving week, Department of Transportation officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enforcement translates into higher restraint use,''
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said. ``And higher restraint
use translates into real lives saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six of 10 children killed in automobile crashes in 1998
were not wearing seat belts, according to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The travel days around Thanksgiving are among the busiest of the
year. And law enforcement officers will issue citations to drivers
with unrestrained children in the car in an effort sponsored by the
Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign, the Department of
Transportation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies in every state will conduct child
safety checkpoints. The officers will also enforce the laws on seat
belts for adults.
</P>
<P>
   All states have laws requiring that children under 4 be
restrained while riding in a car. But the laws vary with regard to
older children, the type of vehicle and even whether a passenger is
in the front seat or back seat. Twenty-five states require that
children up to 16 be restrained at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Over the two years that the campaign has focused on drivers not
buckling up their children, seat belt use is up and deaths are
down. Fatalities for children under 5 have declined 12 percent. And
seat belt use has increased from 62 percent to 70 percent, meaning
19 million more Americans are wearing seat belts, according to the
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Still motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death
for children age 5 to 14, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. Last year, 2,009 children under 16 died in
auto accidents, with nearly 320,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 800 adult drivers that was released Monday by the
seatbelt campaign contained both bad news and good news: The study
found that 13 percent of those who regularly drove with children
under age 12 admitted not making sure the children were always
restrained. On the other hand, 70 percent of drivers said they felt
angry when they saw unbuckled children in a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers who consciously break the law and knowingly place
children at deadly risk by failing to buckle them up are deadbeat
drivers,'' said Janet Dewey, executive director of the seatbelt
safety campaign. ``And they need to be stopped, ticketed and
fined.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a week of drifting in and out of consciousness
in an intensive care unit, Nicole Barrett, the woman who was struck
in the head with a brick in midtown Manhattan, has begun to speak
and ask about what happened to her, her family said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peering up from her hospital bed, through the medication and the
confusion, she has shown the most determined signs of progress so
far, advancing past merely opening her eyes and moving her limbs to
trying to sit up and pose complex questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is talking with us,'' said her mother, Sharon Barrett.
``Sometimes she knows us by name. She knows quite a bit more than
we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, 27, has been in critical condition at Bellevue
Hospital Center since last Tuesday afternoon, when she was attacked
at the intersection of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue by a man who
slammed the back of her head with a brick.
</P>
<P>
   The brick, described by Police Commissioner Howard Safir as a
``six-and-a-half-pound paving stone,'' fractured her skull and sent
her pitching to the sidewalk face-first, leaving her with severe
brain trauma and facial bruises. In the hours after the attack, she
underwent two operations to relieve swelling and blood clots on and
near her brain. She was unconscious for days.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to find Ms. Barrett's assailant, police
responded in force Monday morning after a woman reported seeing a
man hurl a stone through the window of a parked car on Manhattan's
Upper West Side. Officers fanned out into Riverside Park and the
adjacent neighborhood to see whether anyone else had seen the man.
But police ultimately determined that the description the witness
gave did not match the one given by witnesses to the assault on Ms.
Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to respond to each and every report,'' said
Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman. ``We take what
happened last Tuesday very seriously, naturally, and so we're going
to investigate the calls we receive.'' Safir continued to appeal
for more information from New Yorkers. So far, he said,
investigators have looked into hundreds of tips. ``We check them
all out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett's mother and brother, accompanied by Safir and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, met with reporters Monday to provide the latest
reports about her condition.
</P>
<P>
   Their update, based on a week of observation as the brain
swelling has subsided, included clearly optimistic signs. The
family said Ms. Barrett had begun speaking, asking, for instance,
how she ended up in the hospital, and telling her mother that she
hurts. She has also struggled to sit upright in her bed and appears
to have considerable physical strength, they said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Mrs. Barrett said, the doctors and visitors have
refrained from telling her daughter that she was attacked. ``Her
boyfriend is with her, and he just told her she had a bad
accident,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, a hospital official offered further
details, saying that within the last two days Ms. Barrett had
started eating small amounts and was speaking in compound
sentences, not merely uttering names or simple thoughts. She is
also complaining of a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is making very nice progress, but we are still calling her
critical,'' said Lorinda Klein, a hospital spokeswoman. ``Lots can
happen yet. She's doing well, but she could have another setback,
and we're being cautious about what we say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klein said she expected Ms. Barrett to be in the hospital
for weeks. Once she leaves intensive care, doctors will have to
evaluate the extent of the brain damage and what course of
rehabilitation to undertake, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the news conference was noteworthy for its cheerfulness.
Mrs. Barrett and her son, Scott, 24, who traveled last week from
the family home in Athens, Texas, appeared calm and at ease in
front of the crush of cameras and microphones. They said that they
had achieved a certain peace of mind through closeness and prayer,
and that they were feeling strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on God a great deal,'' Mrs. Barrett said, and noted
that the churches in their hometown had formed continuous prayer
chains for her daughter, known as Nikki, and that a priest was one
of the first people to assist her after she fell to the street. She
said they had asked God for a miracle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Barretts also had warm words for New York. Giuliani, who ran
the conference, all but glowed beside her as she said they had been
overwhelmed by their treatment since arriving from East Texas last
week. ``Now we know why Nicole loves New York. Now we do, too,''
Mrs. Barrett said, later adding, ``We just can't believe there are
so many kind people in the world, much less in one city.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, during his remarks, announced the formation of a
city-supervised Friends of Nikki Fund that will accept donations to
help the family pay for Ms. Barrett's treatment and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the fund would assure donors that their money will
be properly accounted for. ``There are people who take advantage of
times like this and run around pretending to collect money,''
Giuliani said. Donations can be submitted to the Friends of Nikki
Fund, Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, 51 Chambers St., Room 630,
New York, NY 10007.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett's father, Arlen, who has been undergoing treatment
for cancer, was not at the news conference. The family said he was
exhausted and was resting.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Barrett said the family planned to remain with Nicole
indefinitely and would share the holiday with ``a nice turkey meal,
by her side, wherever she is.''

ARENA FOOTBALL GETS TV DEALS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arena Football League, the high-scoring downsized version of
traditional football, which helped the St. Louis Rams quarterback
Kurt Warner learn to make quick decisions, announced three-year
television deals Monday with TNN, ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC worth $25
million in cash and promotional value.
</P>
<P>
   The deals ensure that TNN will carry regular-season games on 14
consecutive weeks, plus four playoff games; ESPN and ESPN2 will
show up to six playoff games, and ABC will carry the Arena Bowl
championship game, as it has for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The deals cut ESPN and ESPN2's coverage of games, which were not
scheduled at regular times, and brought in TNN, a cable network
owned by CBS. TNN becomes the league's main TV carrier and will buy
the time required to show the games on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were attracted to TNN's ability to promote our sport,''
Commissioner David Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   By holding costs down and creating a successful complement to
the National Football League, the AFL, which will add its 18th team
next week, has been the most successful second-tier sports league.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are worth $7 million each, and the NFL earlier this year
purchased an option to buy 49.9 percent of the league.

NEW YORK IS NEAR DEAL ON USING TOBACCO SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Just as the states are about to take in a torrent
of money from their settlement with tobacco companies, New York's
lawmakers are moving toward a consensus that most if not all of the
state's share should be spent on health.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gov. George Pataki proposed spending
three-quarters of the money on reducing the state's debts; the
Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said a large chunk of it might go
toward school construction; and the Senate majority leader, Joseph
Bruno, said he wanted a major share to go to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But as the distribution of the settlement money approaches _ the
first payments are expected in the first half of December _ none of
the three men have voiced such views lately. Bruno and Silver have
said that all of the state's share, $1 billion for the first year,
should go toward health care, though they differ on the definition
of that term. Pataki's office has kept his plans intentionally
vague, but there, too, officials are talking about using it for
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest shift has come from Bruno, a Republican, who began
the year saying he favored spending about one-third of the tobacco
money on health care. But last week Bruno said he thought virtually
the entire amount should go toward health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that money comes from a result of a settlement with
tobacco companies,'' Bruno said, ``and the settlement was based on
increased health care costs to the citizens of this country and
this state, we think it's appropriate that we target it for health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   The money stems from the lawsuits filed by most of the states
against the major tobacco companies to recover Medicaid costs for
health care related to tobacco use. The main case was settled late
last year on behalf of 46 states for $206 billion, to be paid over
25 years. Four other states settled for $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The precise amounts of the disbursements will vary from year to
year, but New York will receive $1 billion a year, for a total of
$25 billion. Of that, slightly less than half will go to local
governments, including $6.7 billion to New York City, which share
in Medicaid costs. The state government will receive the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said Monday that his first priority would be to spend $125
million a year to subsidize drug prescriptions for elderly people
who have limited incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he said, should be an effort to provide health coverage
for some of the more than 3 million people in the state who have no
health insurance, and to run an aggressive anti-smoking program,
including advertising, education and treatment. Some Senate
Republicans propose $100 million a year or more for anti-smoking
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The final decisions are likely to be made in next year's budget
negotiations, so a resolution is probably at least six months away.
Even so, anti-tobacco groups are encouraged by what they hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased because we've seen a great change since
last winter,'' said Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a
Tobacco-Free New York. ``We are hoping that for once, in Albany,
they won't just use the money to take care of as many special
interests as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he changed his mind when he learned that the health
care programs he wanted were far more expensive than he had
thought, and when he received advice from other Senate Republicans.
Republicans are concerned that their 36-to-25 edge over Democrats
in the Senate could slip in next year's elections, and they have
been seeking ways to appeal to centrist voters in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Democrat, has said all along that he favors using most
of the money for health care, primarily coverage for the uninsured,
and his aides say he has all but abandoned the school construction
idea. He has also proposed an anti-smoking program that would cost
$90 million a year. ``His position is, it's all for health, one way
or another,'' said Patricia Lynch, Silver's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently, the governor, a Republican, declined to say
whether he still favored spending the settlement money on debt
reduction, and would not offer anything in its place. But
anti-smoking advocates and legislative aides say Pataki's office
has been working on a package of health care uses for the money.
The governor has also spoken favorably of expanding the state's
anti-tobacco programs, though he has not made any proposals or
cited any figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all those issues,'' said Michael McKeon, the
governor's press secretary, adding that he could not be more
specific. ``Health care is important, and debt reduction remains an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But anti-smoking groups fear that talk of spending the
settlement money on health care could mask plans to use it to
supplant existing allocations for existing programs. In particular,
Republican lawmakers have been looking for a way to reduce the
state surcharges that are added to all hospital bills to reimburse
hospitals for treating the indigent, and for postgraduate training
of young doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said last week that he was still open to using some of the
money to replace those surcharges, effectively using the tobacco
settlement to lower costs for health insurers. But Silver rejected
that idea, saying it was not a legitimate health care purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get any additional spending that way,'' Sciandra
said. ``If they turn it into a zero-sum game, tobacco control will
lose out.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, New York was one of just four states to do any
kind of anti-tobacco advertising. Now, 20 states have programs that
include advertising, and they all spend more per capita than New
York does. New York spends $8 million a year on its program,
compared with more than $100 million by California.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman has said that all of her
state's share of the settlement should go toward health programs,
but legislators are calling for spending it on everything from
school construction to transportation. As in New York, the dispute
is expected to become part of next year's budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first two years, Connecticut lawmakers have committed
the money to several health programs _ including vaccinations and
dental care for children, community health centers and a
stop-smoking program _ and to schools.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 21 states have made decisions about how to spend the
money, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Of the money that has been earmarked, the group says, 30 percent
will go to health care, 23 percent to education, 11 percent to
anti-smoking efforts, 10 percent to programs for children that are
not related to health care, and 9 percent to services for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and Nassau County, the two local governments that
will receive the largest shares of New York's settlement income,
have decided to sell bonds backed by the 25-year revenue stream,
rather than waiting for the money, a strategy that a handful of
states are also using. The city recently sold $709 million in
bonds, Nassau is preparing a $302 million bond sale, and each plans
more sales in the future.

FRENCH SALON ACCUSED OF FALSIFYING U.S. VISAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's no law against lying about your hair color,
and Jacques Dessange Inc. has always been willing to oblige
brunettes wanting to be blond, or vice versa, at its chic hair
salons.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a law against lying on visa applications, and
federal prosecutors said Monday that the French beauty care company
did just that so that dozens of its Paris-trained stylists and
colorists could work illegally in New York and elsewhere, as part
of the company's plan to rapidly expand in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment filed in Manhattan charged the company and
two of its New York-based lawyers with conspiracy to commit
immigration fraud. The company and the lawyers were also each
charged with 30 counts of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Bernard Sagon, said in a statement that
the charges were a ``gross and unfair overreaction'' by U.S.
authorities. To classify the incidents described in the indictment
as criminal, he said, was ``a terrible distortion of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from Paris on Monday night, Sagon said, ``We
react with confusion, frustration and concern.'' He said talks with
the government had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible to negotiate,'' he said, ``because we are
completely innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that in 1994, the company, which then had
just one salon in the United States, at 505 Park Avenue, decided to
carry out its expansion plans and create a chain of high-end French
salons, with a goal of opening 100 across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company's officials in New York believed that it was
``critical to bring a large number of experienced French
hairstylists and colorists to the United States'' to create a
quality image, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The company promised the owners of its franchises ``a steady
supply of French stylists and colorists,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   But to quickly send a large number of French stylists and
colorists to the United States, the indictment charged, a company
vice president in New York, who was not named, and the two lawyers
applied for a special visa that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service reserves only for high-level managers who are being
transferred by their company to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, about 50 stylists and colorists who were otherwise
ineligible for the special visas were admitted into the United
States to work in salons, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, it said, their visa applications falsely stated
that they were to be paid salaries of $1,000 a week. In reality,
the indictment charged, most of the workers ``were guaranteed only
a substantially lower salary.''
</P>
<P>
   The company and the two lawyers charged in the case, Howard
Deutsch and Libby Salberg, will be arraigned on Dec. 2 in federal
District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors said. None of the French
workers were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch's lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, said: ``Howard has done
nothing to violate the law. The evidence in this case is going to
show that he had no motive to commit any crime, nor did he commit
any crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Salberg's lawyer, Catherine L. Redlich, said their
clients would plead not guilty. Ms. Redlich declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Jacques Dessange Inc. could face a fine of
$500,000 on each count, said the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sagon said the company had relied on its New York lawyers and
was the victim of ``receiving bad legal advice.'' He said the
company filed a legal malpractice suit against the firm of Deutsch
&AMP; Salberg last month in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sagon said the company, which operates 600 salons around the
world, still had only five in the United States, and he disputed
the contention that the company had sought a rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company did want to bring in its specially
trained stylists, saying they offered something unique. ``Jacques
Dessange is a French company with a French style,'' Sagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to the charges were mixed Monday in the world of New
York hair salons.
</P>
<P>
   The stylist Garren, of Garren New York at Henri Bendel, said he
was not aware of the allegations, but speaking generally, added
that Jacques Dessange appeared to have wanted to ``create what they
created in Paris and bring it to America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically what they were trying to do,'' he said, ``the
whole package, that women feel that they have stepped into the door
of a Paris salon, and experience what they would have experienced
in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stylist, Grace Figueroa, assistant to the president of
Jean Louis David, a French hair salon chain with 10 stores in New
York, sniffed at the idea that the French had unique hair
techniques that could not be emulated by their American
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I highly doubt that the French have developed something
special to them,'' she added.

EUFROSINA RAILEANU, 39, CITY OPERA VIOLINIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eufrosina Raileanu, the principal violist of the New
York City Opera Orchestra and a busy freelance player who worked
with several chamber groups, died on Saturday at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 39 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from breast cancer, said Sato
Moughalian, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raileanu, who was known as Zina, was born in Romania in 1960
and came to the United States in 1978 as part of a group of
teen-agers who had won musical competitions and were allowed to
study abroad. Ms. Raileanu, along with most of the others in the
group, decided to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She earned a master's degree at the Eastman School of Music in
Rochester, N.Y., and a doctorate at the Juilliard School in
Manhattan, where she studied with Lillian Fuchs.
</P>
<P>
   As a chamber music player, Ms. Raileanu performed as a guest
with the Juilliard Quartet, the Mendelssohn Quartet, the Sea Cliff
Chamber Players, the Da Capo Chamber Players and the Chelsea
Chamber Ensemble. She joined the New York City Opera as principal
violist in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her work at the New York City Opera, she was a
substitute violist for the New York Philharmonic and the Orpheus
Chamber Orchestra, with which she toured and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raileanu is survived by her mother, Sylvia, of Brooklyn; a
brother, Val, of Manhattan; and her father, Nicolau, who lives in
Romania.

IN THE HAMLET OF ACCORD, THERE IS ANYTHING BUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCORD, N.Y. _ Accord should be a place of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Just 90 miles from New York City, this hamlet in the Hudson
Valley, encircled by fruit orchards and flinty mountains, is home
to two groups: plain-spoken farmers and truckers who scrape by on
camaraderie and shrinking incomes, and Manhattan weekenders, who
bought low-cost land from the 1970s on and restored dilapidated
farmhouses into retreats.
</P>
<P>
   This marriage of opposites has worked well throughout southern
Ulster County, now a booming weekend destination where celebrities
like Robert De Niro have built homes and where three-star
restaurants have opened alongside package and hunting stores.
</P>
<P>
   But in Accord, the conflicting cultures have bred a remarkable,
and even bizarre, level of hostility: lawsuits have been filed;
old-timers and newcomers have sworn off talking to each other,
except perhaps to say something nasty; and accusations of
harassment and corruption prompted both the FBI and the state
attorney general to briefly open, and then close, an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The battleground is 88 square miles of beauty within the town of
Rochester, population just under 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began in 1992 over a speedway that reopened near
the homes of newcomers, who have been fighting it ever since. The
rancor has gone on to encompass various zoning laws _ namely who
can or cannot build what where _ cries of trespassing, and most
recently, an uproar over a truck shed. And in a measure of the
extreme level of unease, the town has instituted a set of rules
governing public meetings: no booing or hand-clapping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the issues, to hear the combatants tell it, have come to
transcend property and zoning regulations. The longtime residents,
some of whose families settled here in the 1600s, say they are
fighting to preserve their informality and freedom, and, above all,
their livelihood. The weekenders, some of whom have lived here
year-round for two decades, say they want to get equal treatment as
taxpayers and residents, and to safeguard the small-town qualities
that first drew them to Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I come to what I think is this nice idyllic place,'' said
Iris Lewis, 42, a Manhattan designer, weeping one recent morning in
her stone home on 60 acres. Since then, she said, her life has
turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by a neighbor's truck shed, large enough for an
18-wheeler, she formed a group and sued the town last year,
accusing it of selectively enforcing, and even changing, zoning
laws to benefit longtime residents.
</P>
<P>
   After that, cars began to trespass menacingly, idling on her
property for long periods, despite the video camera and ``Keep
Out'' signs on her driveway. Death threats appeared in her mailbox,
Ms. Lewis said, including a cartoon last winter of stick figures
crying and waving goodbye. ``Every year that I'm here,'' she said,
``it gets bigger and it gets uglier.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, longtime residents say that Ms. Lewis and her
wealthy friends are trying to remake Accord in their own image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, this town is just farmers and truck drivers, and
there's nothing we can do about it,'' said Lori Schneider, 24, who
lives in a trailer with her husband, a truck driver. The Schneiders
were drawn into the fray after Ms. Lewis' group, Citizens Against
Illegal Zoning, challenged their plan to build a truck garage in
their back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Meade Dewitt, a dairy farmer whose family has been here
since 1648, said that the newcomers do not understand rural life.
It ``isn't peace and quiet,'' he said. It is big trucks, rumbling
farm equipment and compromise born of poverty in a town where
people scrape by to make a living. The equivalent, he said, would
be like ``us going down into the city and saying, `We don't like
taxicabs anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1970s on, newcomers like Ms. Lewis bought land and
created a tousled retreat unlike the Hamptons. Today, they own
one-third of Rochester's 3,000 residential parcels. And as the
town's former code enforcement officer, Michael Redmond, pointed
out recently: ``I keep constantly hearing about the people who
don't live here. But everybody lives here. We're all us.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems began in 1992, when a speedway that had been closed
for five years roared back to life after town officials swiftly
approved a special-use permit for an upstate farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers demanded that the town study the environmental
impact before letting the man reopen the track. But at a heated
public meeting, officials contended that a town law limiting
speedway noise to 79 decibels was protection enough. The newcomers
were outraged, predicting a blow to their property values. The cars
raced on summer weekends, bringing traffic and noise to their
doorsteps. So they organized.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna and Kim Massie, who moved from Brooklyn to a remodeled
barn near the track in 1973, formed a protest group, Citizens
Accord Inc., with 300 members. They began a legal battle that has
lasted seven years; at each step, the town has successfully
appealed. The Speedway's owner, David Flach, a red-bearded farmer
from Ravena, says he has spent $300,000 in legal fees because the
Massies have ``big mouths and big wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the group sued the town for failing to enforce its own
laws, after a sound engineer found that the speedway noise exceeded
79 decibels. The town then passed a law allowing sound levels to be
averaged by measuring quiet time between races. Citizens Accord
then sued town officials for conspiring to deprive the group's
members of their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The costly litigation did not go over well with some longtime
locals, who, the Massies said, began dumping garbage on their lawn,
honking at them and making obscene phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The town observes its own laws, said Douglas Dymond, the code
enforcement officer whose son races at the track. But he added,
``These people are against racetracks. They're against gravel pits.
Their agenda goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Accord, newcomers contended that the town was giving
businesses special-use permits to open in residential areas,
violating zoning laws and aesthetic principles. One longtime
resident, Carlo Ferrialo, switched sides and joined Ms. Lewis'
group, after a condemned bungalow colony reopened across the street
from his immaculate mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   In memorandums, the town's building inspector, who is legally
blind, claimed not to see evidence of dilapidation on the site. So
in June, Ferrialo hired a private surveyor who documented seven
pages of violations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the newcomers argued that their efforts at redress were
thwarted by ``collusion'' and ``conspiracy.'' At a town board
meeting that year, Steve Fornal, a outspoken newcomer with long
hair and a wispy goatee, handed out pamphlets that he said
documented the town's manipulation of its own laws. With a
withering tone, he read aloud the dictionary definition of codify.
``Note,'' he said, ``codification does not mean wholesale change of
laws.'' The room exploded in applause.
</P>
<P>
   The town responded by passing a law that prohibited
hand-clapping, booing and demonstrating at public meetings. It also
restricted citizens to addressing board members for no more than
three minutes, and only if called on by the town supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to elaborate, Fornal said he had taken steps to protect
himself, after his mailbox was was shot at and run over nine times.
</P>
<P>
   The town supervisor, Robert Baker, who did not run for
re-election and will step down on Dec. 31, did not return numerous
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with paranoia and menace escalating, the newcomers
found the ultimate object for their anger: a 29-by-50-foot truck
shed built by a neighbor, Richard Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Smith, 32, a slim and unassuming trucker, hardly
looks like a target for fancy lawyers. But after he got a
special-use permit to build a truck shed near his home, Ms. Lewis'
group claimed that he was running an illegal trucking business
there, and offered the Zoning Board of Appeals a stack of Polaroid
photographs and public records to support its claim.
</P>
<P>
   When Rochester officials upheld the permit last February, Ms.
Lewis' group declared war. It sued Smith and town officials,
claiming that they conspired to break zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths, meanwhile, sank $5,000 into legal fees, and held a
victory party last summer after the state Supreme Court upheld
their permit.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Ms. Lewis' group, Citizens Against Illegal
Zoning, filed an appeal. At an Oct. 12 meeting of the Zoning Board
of Appeals, Smith and Fornal got into a verbal tussle. Warned by
board members to be respectful, Smith yelled, ``I don't think
there's any respect in this town.'' A board member then called the
state troopers and threatened to have him arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Smith's wife Jennifer, 28, sat at the kitchen
table in their modest home and rifled through two years of
newspaper articles, lawyers' letters and zoning documents. Like so
many Accord residents, she compulsively keeps records of her
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just to build a garage, so my husband doesn't have to
lay out in the dirt and mud to do an oil change,'' she said,
denying that they run a home business. ``In this town, you can't
better yourself without a lawsuit. Where does it end?''

TELECOM ITALIA SHARES RISE AFTER END OF SPINOFF PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Shares in Telecom Italia SpA and the companies that
acquired it last spring climbed Monday after a decision to abandon
a plan to strip the company, Italy's biggest phone provider, of its
profitable cellular phone unit.
</P>
<P>
   On the Milan exchange, shares in Telecom Italia and Telecom
Italia Mobile, the cellular phone unit, as well as Tecnost SpA, the
company through which Olivetti SpA bought Telecom Italia, rose 4
percent to 5 percent in heavy trading early in the day. Shares of
Telecom Italia finished up 0.19 euro, or 1.8 percent, to 10.37
euros, while shares in the mobile unit added 0.25 euro, or 3.7
percent, to 7.18 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Tecnost climbed 0.09 euro, or 4.6 percent, to 2.23 euros.
Olivetti gained slightly, rising 0.01 euro, to 2.16 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while investors appeared pleased with the
weekend decision, they would not be fully reassured until Roberto
Colaninno, the chief executive of Olivetti, Tecnost and Telecom
Italia, gave more details of alternative strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Colaninno planned to transfer the cellular phone
unit to Tecnost, an Olivetti gambling-machine subsidiary that took
control of Telecom Italia in May in Olivetti's $34 billion
takeover. Tecnost would have used the unit's cash flow to help pay
back the almost $17 billion in debt it took on.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, minority investors punished shares of the
companies involved for the decision to strip Telecom Italia of its
most valued asset.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Telecom Italia, for instance, tumbled below 8 euros,
or $8.25, compared with the 11.5 euros Olivetti agreed to pay when
it acquired the company. Late last week, the prices regained ground
as investors grew convinced that Colaninno would reconsider his
plan. Analysts said Monday that the shares remained undervalued and
would most likely continue to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings on Sunday, the boards of Olivetti and Tecnost killed
the plan, announcing instead that Telecom Italia would sell shares
in its Internet unit, Tin.it SpA, whose 1.2 million customers and
55 percent share of the Italian market make it the country's
biggest access provider. Telecom Italia did not say how much it
would sell of Tin.it, which analysts value at as much as $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of Colaninno's move go beyond Telecom Italia. The
Italian stock exchange has lagged behind its European counterparts
this year, gaining little more than 2 percent despite bull markets
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attribute this in part to investor displeasure
with a persistence in Italy of old-style financial dealings in
which corporate control is exercised, as at Telecom Italia, through
opaque holding companies, with minority investors often finding
their rights trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the plunge in Telecom Italia's share price fueled
speculation earlier this month that the phone company could become
a takeover target, much the way Mannesmann AG, the big German
engineering and telecommunications group, has become a target for
Vodafone Airtouch in a $123 billion hostile takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government took the speculation so seriously that
government officials warned earlier this month that Rome would
invoke antitrust legislation to block a hostile bid by a major
European competitor for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Mocatta, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in
London, said Colaninno's reversal was encouraging for minority
shareholders because it showed that Colaninno ``cannot choose to
move value around in his chain of holdings.'' But he described it
as a ``win-win situation,'' saying it also benefited Colaninno by
forcing him to find strategic alternatives, such as taking part of
Tin.it public.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts played down the protests of minority
shareholders, saying that Colaninno was merely reacting to the
plunge in Telecom Italia's shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market simply moved against them,'' said Rod Chisholm, an
analyst at HSBC Securities.

COLUMN: A BLESSING FROM BARAK CAN'T HURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you want to open a kosher shop or restaurant, you
have to get a rabbinical seal of approval, known in Hebrew as a
hechsher. Sometimes, a temporal version of a hechsher is needed in
the world of New York politics, and that is exactly what Hillary
Rodham Clinton got over the weekend from the visiting Israeli prime
minister, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it does her any good remains to be seen, of course. But
at this stage of her nascent campaign for U.S. senator _ when she
should be able to count on an overwhelming majority of Jewish votes
here, and finds tepid support at best _ it is no small thing that
Israel's leader pronounced her politically kosher.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to be insensate not to notice that Mrs. Clinton's
campaign is in danger of dying before it is even born. She has some
Democrats already saying she should give up the Senate race. She
has others calling on her to at least give up her day job as first
lady. On all sides, there is a growing perception that, for all her
smarts, she may be a serial bumbler when it comes to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Mrs. Clinton did herself no good among New York's
crucial Jewish voters with her recent (and many would say
absolutely unnecessary) visit to the West Bank. Her sin: She waited
hours before denouncing an anti-Israel diatribe by Suha Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, had prattled
on about Israeli forces' supposedly contaminating Palestinian water
supplies and spraying Palestinian women and children with ``poison
gas.'' Mrs. Clinton's attackers say that instead of then pecking
Mrs. Arafat on both cheeks, she should have immediately stood up
and screamed her outrage, diplomatic obligations as first lady be
damned.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton quickly felt the politically radioactive fallout.
Some polls show her running in a virtual dead heat among Jews
against her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani;
accepted wisdom is that she will need at least two-thirds of the
Jewish vote to win.
</P>
<P>
   But the way some of her Jewish critics have talked, you'd think
she was smuggling dynamite to Hamas suicide bombers. Many of her
sharpest attackers, mind you, are hardly neutral. Some have never
embraced the Israeli-Palestinian peace process set in motion by
Arafat and the martyred Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and
blessed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to stoke the anti-Clinton fervor has been a stream of
invective in journals like Rupert Murdoch's New York Post, which
went so far last week as to print a readers' survey that put both
Clintons among the ``most evil people'' of the millennium. The
president ranked No. 2, barely behind Hitler. His wife was deemed
more evil than the likes of Saddam Hussein, Adolf Eichmann and
Charles Manson. Some newspapers would have tossed out such results
as malicious and patently absurd.
</P>
<P>
   It was significant then that Barak, a former army chief of staff
and Yitzhak Rabin's political heir, came to New York and put the
West Bank incident in perspective. The real sin lay with Mrs.
Arafat, he suggested at a dinner Saturday night sponsored by the
Israel Policy Forum, a group formed to support Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing needed is ``a joint code of conduct during the
negotiations by which both sides refrain from inflammatory
rhetoric,'' he said. Impolite translation: Zip Mrs. Arafat's lip.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Barak turned to Mrs. Clinton. Her visit, he said,
``touched so many hearts in our country and encouraged our peace
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking of the Clintons,'' he went on, ``let me tell you
frankly, I wish that we Israelis will always have such true friends
in the White House. President Clinton, the leaders of Congress and
the American people continue to demonstrate their deep commitment
to a just and fair peace in the Middle East. We are so grateful for
their ongoing assistance. We could not have come this far on the
road to peace without their sustained effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In no way was the prime minister endorsing Mrs. Clinton over
Giuliani, in effect telling New York Jews to buy what she is
selling. All he said _ though that alone counts for something _ was
that she is politically kosher, that she has his personal hechsher.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he helped her is a tougher question than anything Regis
Philbin has come up with on his quiz show. The audience on Saturday
was basically a liberal crowd, the sort of people you might
normally expect to rate the first lady highly. Yet Barak's praise
of her drew thin applause.

 PRESBYTERIAN COURT DENIES TWO EFFORTS AGAINST GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A regional court of the Presbyterian Church dealt
a setback Monday to conservatives trying to categorically ban gay
marriages and the ordination of gays.
</P>
<P>
   In two decisions released Monday, the 12-member Permanent
Judicial Commission of the Synod of the Northeast let stand a
decision by a group of southern New Jersey churches to admit to the
level of candidate _ just one step below an ordained minister _ an
openly gay man who had refused to promise to be celibate. The panel
also upheld the authority of a church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., to
conduct ``holy union'' ceremonies for gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions were the commission's third and fourth this year
on issues affecting gay men and women in the church. In the two
earlier decisions, the commission sided with a more sweeping
interpretation of the church ban on gay and lesbian marriages and
gay ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Those on both sides of the issue predicted Monday that the stage
was set for yet another battle over interpretation of church
regulations before the group's national governing body, the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decisions pivoted on narrow interpretations of a 1997
amendment to the church's Book of Order, which decrees that
marriage is a union between a man and a woman and that those
ordained in the faith ``live either in fidelity within the covenant
of marriage between man and woman or chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Dobbs Ferry church, the commission said that
the Book of Order did not deal with the concept of ``holy unions,''
and that the church was within its rights to conduct such services
since it had accepted the fact that ``these ceremonies do not
constitute marriage'' as defined by the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the southern New Jersey churches, the commission
found that the post of candidate was not an ordained position in
which the church required fidelity in marriage or chastity in
singleness. But it said that if the candidate were to seek
ordination, his avowed intention to have an active homosexual life
should be taken into account.

1ST LOOK AT STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Gov. Jane Hull's stadium task force got its first
look Monday, Nov. 22, at the kind of home the Arizona Cardinals
want: a $329 million venue with a movable grass field, a roof that
opens, 94 luxury suites and seats for 67,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, the task force did not talk about how the stadium would
be paid for or discuss any potential sites, both of which are
expected to be taken up in later meetings and create the most
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The $329 million cost estimate does not include the purchase of
land for the stadium or for parking.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's morning meeting at a Phoenix hotel was open to the
public, marking a reversal of the task force's initial policy of
closed meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away at Maricopa County Superior Court, lawyers
squared off over the issue before Judge Donald Daughton.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for The Arizona Republic and the Associated Press argued
Monday, Nov. 22, that the task force should comply fully with
Arizona's Open Meeting Law. Daughton said he tended to agree and
told task force lawyers to keep that in mind as they draft an
agreement under which the meetings would be run in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Daniel Flores, Hull's general counsel, told the judge,
``The governor will disband this commission if they do not
comply.''
</P>
<P>
   A full hearing on the matter was continued until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Task force members did not vote on anything during Monday's,
Nov. 22, 90-minute session, though there was general agreement that
the panel's main goals should be to recommend a facility that keeps
the Cardinals in Arizona, gets Arizona into the NFL's rotation of
Super Bowl sites and presents an attractive option for the
collegiate Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hull wanted the panel to look chiefly at a football
venue, task force members Monday, Nov. 22, also agreed to do a
quick marketing survey to determine whether there were other uses
for a stadium _ professional soccer, for example, or certain
convention events.
</P>
<P>
   There also was consensus to abandon a proposal for Arizona State
University and the Cardinals to share a stadium, either by
overhauling ASU's Sun Devil Stadium or moving both teams to a new
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to stay at Sun Devil Stadium, and we respect that,''
Cardinals Vice President Michael Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Design consultants estimated that it would cost $202 million to
remodel Sun Devil Stadium as an open-air NFL stadium with arm-chair
seats, larger, enclosed loge boxes and wider concourses. The design
would fall short of what Bidwill says the team needs: a domed
facility that can be air-conditioned, offers more modern comforts
for fans and has lucrative luxury seating.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants offered a ``guesstimate'' of $352 million to enclose
Sun Devil Stadium, although it isn't clear whether it's even
structurally possible.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Monday's, Nov. 22, meeting focused chiefly on what
the Cardinals would like the stadium to look like.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Aylesworth, executive vice president of Huber, Hunt &AMP;
Nichols, a general contractor that has been involved in other
stadium projects, described a venue with a partly opening roof, an
end wall that would open to the outdoors and a movable grass field
that would slide outside to keep the turf alive when games weren't
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   With 94 luxury boxes and 6,800 clubs seats with a lounge area,
the stadium would earn more than the team takes in at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The 67,000 capacity could be reconfigured for special events,
such as a Super Bowl, to seat an extra 11,000. If work began next
year, it could be ready by the fall of 2003, Aylesworth said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed roof would open roughly the width of the field but
would not retract entirely. When open, it would look something like
Texas Stadium in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With the movable wall at one end, the stadium would have an
outdoor feel at winter events, but both roof and wall could be
closed to air-condition the stadium during warmer months.
</P>
<P>
   The open roof would let sunlight reach the turf, but the entire
field would slide like a tray out of the stadium. That would expose
a concrete floor that could be used for other activities.
</P>
<P>
   The design is similar to a one rejected by voters as part of the
Rio Salado Crossing stadium and convention center in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Aylesworth said the movable field, a $6 million item, would
eliminate the need for a far more expensive, fully retractable dome
to keep natural grass
</P>
<P>
   Several task force members questioned the need for a roof
opening if the field could be moved. The proposed roof accounts for
about $54 million of the estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
   Aylesworth responded that the scaled-back sun roof was not as
costly as a fully retractable dome, and would preserve the
stadium's desert ambiance in winter, a factor several panelists
felt would help lure the Super Bowl and sell Arizona during
national television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium would take up 10 acres, with 8 more acres needed to
slide the field outside. Parking would require more acreage.
</P>
<P>
   Financing alternatives are expected to be discussed at the next
meeting on Dec. 2. Public financing options being considered
include so-called tourism taxes _ hotel or motel bed taxes and
rental-car surcharges _ and sports ticket surcharges. &QL;

BBC DOCUMENTARY LOOKS AT MODEL AGENCIES  
 PROMOTING A SECRETARY'S BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (lb) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scoring impressively on a moral rectitude exam has never been a
requirement for landing a powerful job that puts one into daily
contact with 16-year-old girls earning more than ice-cream-parlor
wages for standing in front of a camera with very little on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the degree to which a number of modeling industry
executives have apparently just failed such a test _ one they had
no idea they were taking _ is causing quite a stir in the world's
fashion capitals this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night in England, BBC One will show a documentary
that it says is based on a year of undercover research and will
show people in the modeling business boasting of sexual conquests
with their young charges, supplying the women with drugs and
pawning them off to middle-aged businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The program is part of a series of investigative reports on
current-affairs issues called ``MacIntyre Undercover.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the program, four employees of Elite Model
Management have been suspended, pending an inquiry by the agency:
Gerald Marie, president of Elite's European division; Olivier
Daube, director of recruitment in the New York office; Xavier
Moreau, president of the Elite Model Look contest, and Daniele
Bianco, who has worked as a chaperone in Milan, Italy, where he was
entrusted with driving and protecting models during their off
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's episode of ``MacIntyre Undercover'' was being
edited Monday, and no one from Elite or the press had yet seen it.
But the BBC said in a news release that Marie is seen telling Donal
MacIntyre, the chief correspondent, that he's planning to have sex
with young girls who have succeeded to the final round of the
international Elite Model Look contest.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre and his crew obtained this footage, and much of the
material in the program, using hidden cameras, a tactic that has
led to lawsuits against television newsmagazines in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre disguised himself as a photographer for a fictitious
fashion magazine, Polka Dot. A crew member, Lisa Brinkworth, posed
as a model, and in an article published on Sunday in The Daily
Mail, a British newspaper, she said she filmed Marie offering her
$500 to go to bed with him.
</P>
<P>
   John Casablancas, Elite's founder and chairman, said in a
statement Monday that the comments reportedly made by his employees
are ``if true, wholly inappropriate and run completely against the
principles, standards and conduct'' of his company.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he scoffed at the notion that Marie, who was
once married to the model Linda Evangelista, would have
propositioned Ms. Brinkworth.
</P>
<P>
   Casablancas is having all the models who have ever been in the
care of Bianco, whose job as a chaperone required him to escort
young women to nightclubs, questioned about any sexual
transgressions he may have committed. He also said he is demanding
written explanations from all those accused of offensive behavior
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, we would like none of our employees to have
anything to do with our models,'' Casablancas said.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting a Secretary's Book
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early last summer, Arie L. Kopelman received an
assignment from his boss that usually falls to underpaid
30-year-olds at publishing houses, not middle-aged presidents of
fashion empires.
</P>
<P>
   Kopelman, the president of Chanel Inc., was asked by the
company's chairman, Alain Wertheimer, to play book publicist for a
first-time novelist who also happened to be the secretary to
Wertheimer and his brother, Charles Heilbronn, Chanel's executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was a groan _ one more thing to do,''
Kopelman said. But he added that he found the book, Helen Ellis'
``Eating the Cheshire Cat,'' a story about social competition and
the high cost of the quest for beauty among young women, to be
engrossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was different from almost anything I've read,''
he said. He then wrote to 10 editors at various fashion magazines,
including Anna Wintour of Vogue, asking them to take a look at the
book, which is to be published by Scribner in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellis, 29, worked at a Talbot's clothing store on the Upper
East Side before she took a job at Chanel, arranging Wertheimer's
mail and putting theater tickets into the shoes of Heilbronn, who
liked to work in stocking feet, so he would remember them at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Tuscaloosa, Ala., Ms. Ellis says she has enjoyed
working at Chanel, although she admits to being afraid to visit the
marketing department, where everyone is especially well dressed.
That should no longer be a problem. With part of her book advance,
she said, she bought a Chanel leather jacket.
