KONERKO NEEDED THAT HOME RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Paul Konerko waited nine weeks for his coming out
party. When it finally happened Saturday afternoon, he didn't seem
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko didn't smile as he rounded the bases after crushing a
Bob Wells' fastball for a 431-foot home run in the sixth inning
that turned out to be the game-winner in a 10-6 Dodgers victory
over the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that it was his first major-league homer. The
fact that it took 72 at-bats to get was more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt like I was a rookie here, just a guy with
responsibilities just like everyone else,'' said Konerko, last
year's Minor League Player of the Year. ``That's the way I've seen
my time here. It was important that I produce. I feel I've been
letting them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko was 0 for 8 since his recall from Triple-A Albuquerque
when he singled home two runs in the third inning off Mariners
starter Jeff Fassero. He made the team out of spring training and
started at first when Eric Karros opened the season on the disabled
list. But he batted just .197 (12 for 61) without an extra base
hit. His four RBI Saturday were two more than he had all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this has been tough for him,'' manager Bill Russell
said. ``But no one ever doubted his talent. He is an excellent
hitter. He just needed an opportunity and some time to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup bump: Konerko started a first with Karros as the
designated hitter. Juan Castro played third in place of Bobby
Bonilla, who was sent home with flu, sore throat and a .204 batting
average since joining the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him to go back about 2{ hours before the game,''
trainer Charlie Strasser said. ``He really isn't in very good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Mlicki struggled:!off! Dave Mlicki's Dodgers debut was
rocky. He allowed eight hits and five earned runs in just three
innings. Although he reportedly had the best arm in the New York
Mets organization, Mlicki seemed intent on trying to beat the
Mariners with breaking pitches and off speed stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a little confused with what he should do,'' said
pitching coach Goose Gregson. ``I'm not so sure he knew what
direction to take over there. I've only seen him once but I saw
some pitches I liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki is the Dodgers fifth starter, the same role he had in New
York. But the Mets suffered 10 rainouts early this year and he was
bumped around in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't very good, but I feel confident everything will
fall into place,'' said Mlicki, whose ERA jumped to 6.15.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits: Antonio Osuna took over for Jim Bruske to begin the
eighth and pitched two scoreless innings to earn his second save.
In the ninth, Osuna, the closer on Opening Day, struck out Alex
Rodriguez and got Ken Griffey Jr. to line to first. Those players
are 1-2 in the American League in homers, led by Griffey's 23....
Eric Young went 3 for 5 with three runs and two stolen bases,
raising his NL lead to 26.... When Raul Mondesi threw out Edgar
Martinez at the plate to end the seventh, it was the 60th assist of
his career.

Column: Belmont provides remarkable drama
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ A picture might be worth a thousand words, but a
photo finish is worth $5 million, depending on your camera angle.
</P>
<P>
   In as epic a stretch run as the Belmont Stakes has seen, Victory
Gallop and Real Quiet went nose-to-nose and stride-for-stride
Saturday. Students of horseflesh were rewarded with a race for the
ages, if not the wonder colt who was expected to join a legendary
list.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be much consolation for Real Quiet, and his
connections, who were denied the Triple Crown, the megabucks bonus,
and the thrill of proving his critics wrong. But in losing to
Victory Gallop by a nostril, Real Quiet might have won the respect
that had been withheld after his wins in the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Triple Crown roll call holds at 11, and another year
has passed without a champion to join Affirmed, the last in 1978.
But it wasn't the curse of Belmont that beat the underrated son of
Quiet American. Victory Gallop did it with a closing charge that
electrified a near-record crowd of 80,162.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Secretariat or Citation or War Admiral. The last time
anyone had seen ground closed that fast, it was Silver or Trigger
or Champion trying to catch a train or a stagecoach.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those at the track and watching on TV had conceded the
race to Real Quiet, and were preparing to measure the skinny bay
colt for his new credentials. It would be hard to imagine a wilder
or more controversial ending than the one this race almost
produced. It could have been decided on a disqualification _ if
Real Quiet had hit the finish line first.
</P>
<P>
   Disqualification loomed
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing fact is no one knew, at that moment, who had
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' said Bob Baffert, the witty trainer with the
hair by Clorox. ``I thought we might have won on a head bob. I
asked Wayne Lukas in front of me and he said, `You got it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he hadn't, although there was an unbearable wait as the tote
board flashed the signal for a steward's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, who deprived Baffert of his Triple Crown on
Saturday and lost it for him on Silver Charm a year ago, had filed
a complaint that turned out to be unneeded. When Victory Gallop
roared from seven lengths back in the final eighth of a mile, the
two colts were so close, the distance so short, it wasn't possible
to see that Real Quiet veered to his right and bumped his rival
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told one of the outriders to hold the race,'' Stevens said,
``that my horse had been fouled. He came back and said it didn't
matter, we had you winning, and congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they didn't have to take the horse down,'' Baffert
said. ``That would have been the worst possible finish.''
</P>
<P>
   To quote that famed turf writer, Bill Shakespeare _ pardon us
for name-dropping _ ``It would be argument for a week, laughter for
a month and a good jest forever.'' (Henry IV, Act II.)
</P>
<P>
   But with Real Quiet going for all the worldly goods, and a long
shot named Thomas Jo sneaking through the field to take third,
there was serious theater.
</P>
<P>
   This day this Long Island hamlet was clearly a two-horse town,
with a broken heart for every light on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   There was Kent Desormeaux, Real Quiet's excitable jockey, who
kept beating himself up because he made his move exactly where he
had at Churchill Downs and Pimlico. This time the track was a
quarter-mile longer.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert defended his rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say he went too early,'' Baffert said. ``He didn't
go too early. That's the horse's style. The Fish (his nickname for
the colt with the narrow chest) floundered. He was tired. He ran
his heart out. I thought Kent ran a great race. And Gary Stevens
ran a great race.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbridled emotions
</P>
<P>
   If ever a jockey had been there and done that, and knew the
whirlpool of emotions, it was Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Kent in the paddock,'' he said, ``and I know exactly
what he is feeling right now. He feels like he let the whole nation
down. But he didn't. Last year I was devastated. Silver Charm
didn't see that horse, didn't see Touch Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   As a footnote to the day's drama, Houston is once again the
capital of horse racing upsets. Last year's Belmont winner, Touch
Gold, is owned in part by Bob McNair, who is heading the city's
effort to acquire a pro football franchise. Victory Gallop, of
course, is owned by the Jack, Art and J. R. Preston, of The
Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear the Prestons were as thrilled, and speechless, as
Baffert was disheartened and, well, not so speechless. Two years in
a row, he has missed a Triple Crown on the last leg, this time in a
finish that ties the two closest in Belmont history. Victory Gallop
joins Granville in 1936 and Jaipur in 1962 in winning by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't possible to win a race by less of a margin because
horses have longer noses than eyelashes. On that cosmetic note, let
the second-guessing begin.

DESORMEAUX IN FAMILIAR POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ When you've been the goat as often as Kent
Desormeaux, you learn just how to wear the horns.
</P>
<P>
   So Desormeaux placed them on himself Saturday _ before anybody
else could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to do it again,'' the jockey said of the Belmont
Stakes, which he and Real Quiet lost by a margin so narrow that any
little mistake might have made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you saying it's your fault?'' somebody asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhat, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux is 28, the most decorated young rider in the nation,
yet he has been in positions like this so many times already, they
are in danger of defining his career.
</P>
<P>
   There was the day in Japan, in 1993, when he misjudged the
finish line in a multi-million-dollar race and Kotashaan finished
second. It wasn't clear the horse would have won without the
blunder. Still, given that Desormeaux was already under fire at
home in California for easing up on beaten horses and costing
bettors exacta and trifecta payoffs, the Kotashaan incident seemed
to fit the image of a brilliant but mistake-prone athlete.
</P>
<P>
   There was the day at Santa Anita Park, in 1994, when Desormeaux
and The Wicked North entered the stretch with the lead in the Santa
Anita Handicap but they tipped slightly toward the rail and
bothered another horse and were disqualified. The stewards'
decision was controversial in its own right, and nobody could say
for sure that Desormeaux's steering was a factor, but by then the
fans loved to hate him and everybody piled on.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is the day at Belmont Park when Desormeaux and
Real Quiet rushed into contention with half of the 1{-mile race
left to run, when they opened a four-length lead in the stretch
instead of conserving energy, when they zig-zagged through the
final yards and risked the stewards' wrath.
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since a dazzling victory in the Preakness
Stakes put Real Quiet on the verge of the first Triple Crown since
1978, Desormeaux must have thought about the possibility he would
lose and you-know-who would get the blame. He had admitted that as
the Belmont approached, he had trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew the feeling better than Gary Stevens, the jockey who
lost the Belmont and the Triple Crown aboard Silver Charm a year
ago and the jockey who outrode Desormeaux Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go out of the jocks' room and go out to ride with the
weight of the world on you, there's so much pressure on you, you
don't even realize how much until afterwards,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens told reporters that Desormeaux ``has nothing to be
ashamed of.... He did, obviously, what he thought was right at the
time. That's what we get paid for. I think if he is knocked for his
ride, if I was in his position, I wouldn't pay attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Desormeaux had been consoled by Chris McCarron,
who was criticized for his ride when Alysheba lost the Belmont and
the Triple Crown in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux heard McCarron tell him: ``You're going to feel
horrible for the next week and a half. But it absolutely is just
another horse race. There's one (a Triple Crown) with your name on
it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet trainer Bob Baffert was careful not to criticize
Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had a lot of pressure on him,'' Baffert said. ``Maybe
he moved (from sixth to third to first with a quarter-mile left)
because the horse wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Desormeaux said, when he made the first surge on the
backstretch, Real Quiet was ``just cantering'' _ it was the horse
who wanted to go. They made their move at the same point on the
track as they did at Churchill Downs and Pimlico. The difference is
that on those one-mile ovals, that point is half a mile from the
finish, while on this 1{-mile strip, it's three-quarters of a mile
from the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Turning into the stretch, perched on the outside of Chilito and
Grand Slam, that's when Desormeaux thought he pushed the
accelerator too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Real Quiet running on fumes and Victory Gallop
gaining, that's when Desormeaux feared he yanked too hard on the
right rein, turning his colt's head to make sure he saw the
challenger coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled his head out a little too hard,'' said Desormeaux,
whose share of the $5 million Triple Crown bonus might have been
close to $500,000. Had Real Quiet won, he would have been
disqualified for impeding Victory Gallop, or so the Belmont
stewards say now that the point is moot.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Real Quiet had nothing left but his rider's
ingenuity, and who could blame Desormeaux if, perhaps, he intended
to intimidate Victory Gallop a bit. That's race-riding.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a terrible ride. But this wasn't Desormeaux's best
either. And because of that he knows, after losing by a nose, it's
on his head. &QL;

NO LICENSE BRINGS LATE SCRATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ In a comic warmup to the Belmont Stakes drama,
Hot Wells, one of the long shots, had to be scratched on Saturday
morning because the owner didn't apply for a state racing license.
</P>
<P>
   Of all people, the owner, Michael Lasky of Maryland, should have
known there would be trouble. He's the founder and operator of the
Psychic Friends Network.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had filed a last-minute application, Lasky could have
expected little help from New York officials. The last time he
applied here, in 1982, he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch 16 years ago was that Lasky ran racing and sports
handicapping that promised ``inside information.'' The New York
State Racing and Wagering Board decided that licensing him ``would
not be in the best interest of racing,'' said Michael J. Hoblock
Jr., the board's current chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Lasky said he is no longer in the tout business. Hoblock said
Lasky holds licenses in Maryland, Kentucky and Arkansas, claimed to
be licensed in 47 states, and ``was reminded there were not 47
other states with racing.''
</P>
<P>
   New York officials phoned Lasky Friday but got no assurance that
he would apply, Hoblock said. When the 10 a.m. scratch time passed,
Hot Wells was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Hoblock said Hot Wells' entry was accepted Thursday because the
owner was listed as ``So What's Nu Stable,'' and only after Belmont
Park officials found no record of the stable, and after a New York
Post article reported it was Lasky, did a flag go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the fact it's the Belmont Stakes means we should
lower our level of integrity,'' Hoblock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wells was fourth in the Arkansas Derby and the Preakness.
This was to be the first Belmont for jockey Calvin Borel and
trainer Tom Amoss.
</P>
<P>
   Painful scratch: The colic that forced Hanuman Highway to be
withdrawn from the Belmont early Saturday morning was not
considered life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Kathy Walsh said the condition seemed to have been
brought on by nerves. Symptoms, which showed up overnight, included
sweating and pawing the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call at about 3:30 (Saturday) morning and I came right
down here,'' the California-based Walsh said at Belmont, where the
gelding was being treated with painkillers. ``Everybody's so upset,
but it seems like he'll be all right.... We'll just keep a close
eye on him. Colic can be very temporary, or it can be very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanuman Highway, who began the season at Santa Anita and
finished seventh in the Kentucky Derby, would have been a Belmont
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   The scratches reduced the field to 11 horses.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd: The only Belmont to draw a crowd bigger than
Saturday's 80,167 was the 1971 edition, in which 82,694 watched
Canonero II's unsuccessful try for a Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The undercard: In other stakes races on a first-rate Belmont
Park card, Coronado's Quest won the Riva Ridge sprint for
3-year-olds, Chief Bearhart won the Manhattan Handicap on turf and
Richter Scale won the True North sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest is the misbehaving colt who was favored to win
the Preakness but was scratched with a foot injury. Chief Bearhart
won the Breeders' Cup Turf at Hollywood Park and was the 1997 turf
champion.

BASEBALL'S MAGIC IMPROVED LIFE IN ARIZONA'S MINING TOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The townspeople eagerly awaited the first home game of the
baseball season. The newspaper carried stories that heralded the
dawn of a new season, told readers about the magic of baseball and
how it improved the quality of life in a town that desperately
wanted to feel good about itself.
</P>
<P>
   The community's leaders, concerned about the sheer size of the
expected crowd on opening day, cautioned people to use the free bus
transportation to the ballpark. The team's manager and players,
meanwhile, were hoping to prove themselves worthy of the hype.
</P>
<P>
   This was Jerome in 1924. Before signage, revenue streams and
luxury suites became part of the game's language. Back when people
drank water from the same ladle dipped from the same bucket, not
from sealed plastic containers that cost $4.75. Back when smallpox
and a plunge in copper prices could make a tough town cower.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's baseball history stretches back to the last century,
and the game was as crucial to fans then as it is today to the
approximately 3.5 million people expected to attend Diamondbacks
games this season in Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty important thing, when you think about the
dynamics of a (mining camp),'' said Lynn Bevill of Tucson, a
baseball historian. ``It was a channeling of the aggressiveness and
the anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport was popular throughout the state, from Flagstaff to
Douglas, from Kingman to Winslow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1883, just three years after Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp left
Tombstone, a baseball game was a highlight of the town's Fourth of
July celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's 25th Infantry, a Black regiment, was stationed near
Nogales in 1919 and fielded one of the finest teams ever in
Arizona. Seven soldiers from that club later joined the Kansas City
Monarchs, one of the most dominating teams in the early years of
the Negro Leagues. &QL; 
INTENSE RIVALRIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1900s, baseball was being played in all parts of
the state. But nowhere was the sport taken more seriously than in
the state's mining camps, where games sometimes were as raucous as
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   As the sport grew, ballparks were built and rivalries
intensified. And opening day was as eagerly anticipated as it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everything we can in the way of clean sports and
amusements in the district,'' Jerome's ``Copper Verde News''
editorialized in the spring of 1925, ``and one might spend a couple
of hours on a Sunday afternoon in many ways less healthful and less
beneficial generally than watching a good ballgame _ and giving his
lungs some needed exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   These remote outposts also attracted players no longer welcome
in organized baseball. Hal Chase, who led the National League in
hitting in 1916, played in Arizona after leaving the major leagues
amid gambling scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the infamous Chicago Black Sox, Charles ``Chick''
Gandil and George ``Buck'' Weaver, played in Douglas with Chase
after they were banned from the big leagues over allegations they
conspired to throw the 1919 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In most mining towns, the company promoted the sport to provide
recreation for the miners and their families. Baseball proponents
today argue that a major league team enriches a city's quality of
life. That, too, was the mine owners' goal.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted workers to put down roots, and they figured baseball
and other sports added to a sense of community. So they organized
teams and built ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   In Bisbee, the Calumet &AMP; Arizona Mining Co. created a
subsidiary, ``The Warren Co.,'' to develop the suburb of Warren as
a company town. Officials decided a ballpark was in order, and at a
cost of $5,000, the Warren Ballpark was built in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the oldest ballpark in the country still being used
for its intended purpose _ playing baseball _ according to David
Skinner, a baseball historian who lives in Bisbee. Rickwood Field
in Birmingham, Ala., built in 1910, is regarded as the oldest such
facility in the country, but Warren Ballpark opened a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the ballpark was home to teams playing in
``outlaw leagues,'' those outside the structure of major league
baseball. From 1928 to 1955, it was home to several minor league
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Ballpark looks nearly the same as it did in the early
1900s, and it's still used by Bisbee High, youth leagues and a
semi-pro team that recently started playing.
</P>
<P>
   The mine company's reason for building the field was not
altogether altruistic. The ballpark was at the end of the trolley
line, and the company wanted to attract people from Bisbee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ballpark was built, it was a source of civic pride,''
Skinner said. ``The mining company worked hard to bring in
professional players from outside the area.'' &QL; 
INFAMOUS MOMENT &QL; 
Although baseball has been played at the field for nearly 90 years,
the most famous moment in the Warren Ballpark's history had nothing
to do with the game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, there was a miners' strike by the Industrial Workers of
the World, or ``Wobblies.'' On the morning of July 12, using the
cover of darkness, a posse led by the local sheriff rousted nearly
2,000 people out of their beds and marched them to the ballpark,
where they were held under armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   Any miner who vowed to return to work was excused, and the
remaining 1,200 were loaded into cattle cars that were parked on
the tracks beyond the outfield fence. The miners were taken to the
desert of New Mexico, freed but not allowed to return to Bisbee.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball grew in importance, the town rivalries became
heated, with none more intense than the one between Jerome and
Clarkdale.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome is about five miles up Mingus Mountain from Clarkdale,
and the teams from the two towns often played Sunday doubleheaders,
with a game in each city. The United Verde Copper Co. sponsored
baseball teams in each town, and the communities took the games
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The towns of the district are isolated and of necessity the
people are deprived of much of the entertainment that is available
in the largest cities,'' the ``Verde Copper News'' editorialized in
1924. ``This makes it all the more incumbent on us to make the most
of what we have and to give every recreational opportunity our
hearty support.'' &QL; 
KEG EXACTS A TOLL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, the men of Jerome would hitch up wagons and
drive to Clarkdale, where a field was built on the west bank of the
Verde River.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``They Came to Jerome,'' a book about the town's
history, a keg of beer was placed behind home plate, and a team
could imbibe only at the end of innings in which it had scored. If
a team was held scoreless, their opponents' quenched their thirsts.
</P>
<P>
   Games were usually high-scoring affairs, with most of the runs
coming in the later innings, when the beer had exacted its toll.
</P>
<P>
   When the company built a new field in Clarkdale, the people of
Jerome demanded one, too. A spot on a ridge above the mines was
bulldozed and a grandstand was built. Admission was 50 cents, and
some fans traveled to the game on a bus that picked them up near a
downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Most games were played on Sunday afternoons, and they were
sometimes wild affairs. Gambling was prevalent, as were fights
among fans. And it was not only the men who argued. Women resorted
to ``hat snatching, hair pulling and name calling,'' according to
``They Came to Jerome''. &QL; 
BICKERING OVER UMPS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The local paper editorialized against the lack of civility, but
it also contributed, constantly questioning the integrity of the
umpires when the home team lost. In game stories chronicling
victories, the umpiring was usually praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``As nearly perfect as it is possible for umpiring to be,'' the
``Copper Verde'' ``News'' wrote after a 6-4 victory by Jerome.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the two towns bickered over other issues. At
various times, each team was accused of importing illegal players
for important games.
</P>
<P>
   The 1924 season was a particularly contentious one for Jerome
and Clarkdale. Jerome was just emerging from a smallpox outbreak
that claimed 11 lives, and opening day was eagerly awaited.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkdale opened the year by winning three straight against its
rival, and there was great concern in Jerome. Somehow, Jerome
enticed the great Hal Chase to jump from the Williams team to play
for Jerome.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was one of the greatest characters in baseball history.
While with Cincinnati, he led the National League in hitting in
1916. But he fell into disfavor in the seasons after. His manager,
Christy Mathewson, accused Chase of laziness and betting against
his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was cleared of the charges but when the Black Sox scandal
came to light a year later, Chase's named was associated with it
and he was no longer welcome in big league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So he played in outlaw leagues, those not under the umbrella of
organized baseball. There was no better place for a man like Chase
to play than in Arizona's mining communities and border towns,
considered smack in the middle of nowhere. Beginning in 1923, Chase
played or managed teams in Nogales, Williams, Jerome and Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was a notorious drinker, womanizer and gambler, but he was
popular in almost every town in which he played.
</P>
<P>
   With Chase playing first and managing, Jerome's team improved
greatly. It tied Clarkdale for the league lead and later beat its
rival for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Chase didn't last long around those parts. He was soon fired
after being accused of stealing supplies through his job at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1920s, the mining company decided the rivalry had
grown out of control, and chose to sponsor only one combined team
from Jerome and Clarkdale. Players who didn't want to work at a
real job moved on. &QL; 
POPULAR ALONG BORDER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rivalries in southern Arizona were just as heated. Baseball was
popular in Bisbee, Nogales and Douglas and also across the border
in Mexican towns such as Nogales, Naco and Cananea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, a game between the Douglas White Sox and the Nogales
Cuervos ended in a riot, according to a 1984 story in ``Sports
Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   After a controversial call, several Douglas fans came on to the
field and chased the umpire toward center field. Nogales fans
intervened, which brought armed ``federales'' onto the field. They
were engulfed by the crowd, and shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed and dozens of others were injured. The
field was eventually cleared, and despite the bloodstains near the
mound, play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas won and its players and fans were eager to return home.
But they ran into a roadblock on the outskirts of town and asked,
at gunpoint, if they were interested in a rematch the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox agreed, and wisely lost the rematch, 15-8. They
were happy to go home with a split _ and their health.
</P>
<P>
   While the sport had its extremes, most games in those days were
civil, as they are today.
</P>
<P>
   And just as youngsters do today, some players hoped to draw a
scout's attention and one day make it to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dreamed,'' Bevill said. ``No matter how unrealistic it
was, they dreamed.'' &QL;

DISNEY MINING GOLD WITH DIRECT-TO-VIDEO FARE

By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. has decided small is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel to ``The Lion King,'' a worldwide box-office giant
five years ago, will be released in late October on a much smaller
screen than the standard multiplex movie screen: It's going
directly to video.
</P>
<P>
   But, Disney officials insist, don't think that ``The Lion King
II: Simba's Pride'' will be of low quality just because it will
appear in Wal-Mart, not Mann's Chinese Theatre. In fact, analysts
and company officials say, ``Simba's Pride'' represents the latest
in a string of highly successful -- and artistically satisfactory
-- direct-to-video films by the entertainment conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Disney has released profitable direct-to-video
sequels to recognizable properties like ``Aladdin,'' ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Beauty and the Beast,'' along with a
``Winnie the Pooh'' feature.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Simba'' decision underscores the vitality -- and
growing inventory -- of its direct-to-video business, which
generates huge sales at relatively low cost while enhancing the
Disney brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Disney so successful at a time when other studios' video
sales business is flat? It certainly doesn't hurt that the company
name is so trusted by parents to provide age-appropriate
entertainment. And Disney certainly knows how to market its product
to parents and children, making happy retailers who give its videos
prominent shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's expertise in prompting video store customers to buy
videos rather than just rent them has been extraordinary. The
market for buying videos, or ``sell-through,'' has grown from $3.5
billion six years ago to somewhere around $10 billion, driven by
hits like ``The Lion King,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Snow
White,'' ``Toy Story'' and ``Aladdin.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers estimate home video is responsible for more
than half of studios' overall revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home video has been the ancillary window that saved Hollywood
for the last several years,'' said analyst Jay Kim of Paul Kagan
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney, in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, has taken
the lion's share of that. Analyst Tom Adams estimated that Disney's
revenues from domestic home video amounted to $2.57 billion in
1996, his most recent tally. That's 31.2 percent of Hollywood
studios' cumulative cut from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has such a strong brand name that it transcends any
worries that parents might have about content,'' said Barbara
McNamara, an analyst with industry tracker Alexander &AMP; Associates.
``Parents look at a Disney product and automatically assume it's
good for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's little surprise that the entertainment giant has been
kicking its direct-to-video operations into high gear in recent
years as part of its Disney Television Animation operations, which
also produce Disney's animated TV series and specials. The division
now has more than 1,000 employees with animators at studios in
Australia, Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to release as many as four high-profile,
made-for-video titles annually by 2000 under the Disney Premieres
nameplate. The reasoning is simple: It makes more financial sense
to protect one of the Disney crown jewels by bypassing multiplexes,
where a surprise hit like ``Titanic'' can doom rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Disney decided four years ago to start making sequels to
successful family properties and selling them directly to the video
market, saving on production and marketing costs and generating
huge profits. Kim called it a sound strategy because it simply
offers parents more options to what's already an enormously useful
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are on the lookout for videos that will baby-sit their
kids, so that the kids will be fixated for two hours and the
parents can get something accomplished,'' Kim said. ``There really
isn't anything else that comes close to home video's economic value
if you want to get housework done. So there's a healthy appetite
for direct-to-video.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's upcoming direct-to-video titles include ``Pocahontas
II: Journey to the New World,'' due Aug. 25; ``Disney's Doug: The
Movie,'' out in early 1999; ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' due
for the fall of 1999; ``Once Upon a Christmas,'' a trilogy for 1999
with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy; ``Another Goofy Movie''
for early 2000; and a ``Lady and the Tramp'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Morrill, executive vice president of TV animation, said
an additional 40 projects are in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning out to 2001 and are constantly looking
ahead,'' she said. ``Although most of what we do is sequels, we are
also trying to push the envelope in terms of look and style.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's commitment to home video comes in the wake of general
flatness in the industry, which saw rentals fall 3 percent and
sell-through decline 10 percent last year, according to Alexander &AMP;
Associates. McNamara estimates rentals are up 5 percent so far this
year while sell-through has edged down 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though studios are stepping up their releases, there
continues to be strong demand for children's product,'' she said.
``I think the market can definitely bear more.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives insist they are not cutting corners when they
work on direct-to-video projects, hiring the top voice and
technical talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our marching orders were that it's to be done with the same
quality as a feature film,'' said Alan Zaslove, producer of
``Pocahontas II.'' ``That protects its archival value when new
technologies like DVD come to market.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, loosely based on the real-life tale of Pocahontas
going to London, has been in the works for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be beautiful, and it will definitely hold up,''
director Brad Raymond said as he supervised final sound editing
recently. ``In one of our songs, there are over 100 characters,
which is one of the most ambitious things ever done in animation.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on ``Simba's Pride'' began 18 months ago with a story
focused on Kiara, the daughter of Simba, and Kovu, the son of Scar.
Scrutiny from executives has been exceptionally high, said director
Rob LaDuca, adding, ``We've got some big shoes to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The first test groups, made up of mothers with children ages 3
to 11 viewing mostly black-and-white animation, were in November
1997. ``The scores from the focus groups have been really high,''
said Darryl Rooney, director. ``They help toward resolving key
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing for ``Simba's Pride'' has already started. A music
video for it aired during ``The Lion King'' showing on ABC last
month, and a promo was attached to the ``Flubber'' video.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've found is that moms want more family movies; kids
just want to know the rest of the story,'' said marketing executive
Robert Chapek. ``The challenge on direct-to-video is that the
titles are not going to be at the top of people's minds, so we have
to work on that. We ask them to recall the fond moments from the
originals.''
</P>
<P>
   All this hasn't gone unnoticed by Disney's rivals. 20th Century
Fox sold an estimated 5 million copies of its first direct-to-video
title, ``Casper: A New Beginning,'' last fall and has two more
projects in the works. And Universal has sold 20 million copies of
four ``Land Before Time'' videos and has started work on four other
made-for-video projects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no other studio has the brand loyalty as Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena resident Kathy Register said her 5-year-old twin boys
watch Disney animated home videos -- ``The Lion King,''
``Aladdin,'' ``The Jungle Book,'' ``101 Dalmatians'' -- repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't let them watch very much TV, but the Disney videos
are fine and they really love them,'' she said. ``I can't even
estimate how many times they've watched `The Jungle Book'; it's
certainly dozens and dozens. They get very excited about Disney
videos because the marketing on it is huge. They know what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   For a major player like Disney, home video is a gold mine. The
economics are fairly simple -- it costs $4 to duplicate a tape;

</P>
<P>
   For a major player like Disney, home video is a gold mine. The
economics are fairly simple -- it costs $4 to duplicate a tape;
wholesalers pay about $12 per copy; and retailers pay a few dollars
in mark-up and then sell the tape for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   So Disney's strategy of expanding made-for-video titles is a way
to expand profits, Kim said. ``There is more of an untapped
appetite in the sell-through video channel than in movies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Disney can preserve its rather large niche at
major retail chains. ``Shelf space is not open to everyone, so the
names that will be most successful will be those with established
brands,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Although direct-to-video now seems like an obvious strategy,
many observers were skeptical over Disney's first attempt in the
category four years ago when it released ``Aladdin'' sequel ``The
Return of Jafar,'' since it lacked the voice of Robin Williams.
Customers might perceive the video as a lesser-quality product, the
thinking went.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``The Return of Jafar'' was a smash hit that sold more
than 10 million copies, enough to generate around $100 million of
pure profit. Until then, direct-to-video had been viewed as a
backwater catch-all for movies not good enough for theatrical
release along with specialty products like Jane Fonda exercise
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter Katie watched `The Return of Jafar' to death,''
said Rick Manly, an Altadena resident with a 9-year-old daughter
and a 12-year-old son. ``When Disney released it, direct-to-video
really lost the curse of being cheesy. Katie certainly didn't think
it was second-string.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives concede they remain aware that the stigma of
direct-to-video has not been completely erased. And they say that's
part of what drives them to make certain the product lives up to
the hard-to-define Disney quality standard that makes titles
attractive to more than just children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct-to-video has always been an area that was perceived to
have a lot less value, although I think we've changed that,''
Morrill said. ``We are making these as top-quality, as if they
could be shown in theaters, because I never want the product to
play down to 2-year-olds. I want it to be something that the older
brother and the parents can also enjoy.''

BOAT SCORES VICTORY WITHOUT A FIGHT IN TRUE VALUE 500K
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ One year later and minus the fisticuffs,
Billy Boat found victory _ and vindication _ at Texas Motor
Speedway last night.
</P>
<P>
   Denied the first victory of his Pep Boys Indy Racing League
career last June by a scoring snafu, Boat took no chances during
the second annual True Value 500K. Lapping as high as 227.273 mph,
Boat raced record-setting pole sitter Tony Stewart into the
pavement with a blown engine, and outmuscled Plano's Greg Ray to
give himself and car owner A.J. Foyt a second visit to TMS' victory
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back and really wanted to win this one bad,'' said
Boat, who exited victory lane last year as the winner but woke up
the next morning to learn that Arie Luyendyk had been declared the
champion after an all-night scoring audit by the U.S. Auto Club.
``I wasn't going to let that happen tonight. We rolled off the
trailer fast and with a good setup. I had a race car that never
gave up all night long. I was flat out most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat's big moment last year also was marred when Foyt, angered
that Luyendyk had invaded his team's celebration, slapped the
Dutchman in the face and knocked him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt has spent the past year apologizing for that Saturday night
short-track indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt we won it last year and I hope nobody hollers this
year,'' said Foyt, brought Boat to TMS last year as a replacement
driver for the injured Scott Sharp. ``I've been there before. Been
there happy and been there sad. I think it's official, but you
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's exit on lap 176 with a blown engine _ the same
circumstance that knocked him out of the Indy 500 last month _ set
up a three-car sprint to the finish among Boat, Ray and Kenny
Brack, Boat's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Ray drove up under Boat's rear wing entering Turn 1 of the
revamped 1.5-mile trioval on lap 200 of the scheduled 208 and swept
into the lead down the backstretch with the help of backmarker Buzz
Calkins' car on lap 201. But Boat regained the point a lap later
with a pass on Ray exiting Turn 4. On lap 203, Ray moved high and
low, messing with Boat's head at 224.785 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But Boat's car was hauling through the preferred low line,
allowing him to pull to a lead of 0.433 seconds on lap 206. Boat
took the white flag on lap 207 and ripped off a circuit at 224.318
mph, compared to Ray's 222.616. At the checkered flag, that
translated into a margin of victory of 0.928 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy was faster on the top end,'' said Ray, who took
consolation with his best IRL finish. ``We had a better handling
car, but I didn't have enough gear. Boat was running a bigger gear.
But this is like a victory for us. I can't say enough about this
small team, Thomas Knapp Motorsports. This is very exciting for us.
This is second place, but if you can't win the Indianapolis 500,
this is the next best thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, driver of the No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora, started
second in the two-car front row after qualifying at 223.547 mph.
But he was knocked off the pole by Stewart, who turned a track
record lap at 224.448 mph in the No. 1 Glidden-Menards
Dallara/Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart led 57 laps before the engine quit, same as it did in
the waning laps a year ago. Until that point, Stewart and Boat
settled into a one-on-one reminiscent of their dirt-track days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like old times at Ventura (Calif.),'' said
Stewart, the reigning IRL champion. ``We had an overheating
problem. We were good the whole race, just cruising in sixth gear.
There wasn't any urgency to lead the race, but the car was so good
we were just there the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who finished 33rd and last at Indy last month, was
credited with a 14th-place finish here. But he also racked up the
race's fastest lap _ 228.012 mph on lap 86. Boat's fastest lap was
227.273 mph, which also was the fastest lead-lap (142).
</P>
<P>
   Boat's previous best finish this season was third in the
Dura-Lube 200 at Phoenix International Raceway. He led 81 of the
208 laps here, and averaged 145.388 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Boat and Ray were followed across the line by Brack, Scott
Goodyear and Scott Sharp _ the last car on the lead lap.

Nose's difference keeps Real Quiet from taking Triple Crown
<TEXT>

   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ELMONT, N.Y. _ There's no Triple Crown this year, but Houston has a
champion, albeit one with Canadian breeding, in Victory Gallop,
winner of Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running colt by Cryptoclearance finally had enough of
second place, having finished behind Real Quiet in the Kentucky
Derby and the Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, who is nicknamed ``The Fish'' because of his narrow
front end, put up a gallant attempt to be racing's first Triple
Crown winner since Affirmed 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he was nosed out at the wire by Victory Gallop, who is owned
by Jack, Art and J.R. Preston, who live in The Woodlands and
operate an oil company there.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including a majority of the crowd of 80,162 _
second largest ever at Belmont Park _ thought Real Quiet would be
another Affirmed and Victory Gallop another Alydar, who managed a
second-place sweep in the 1978 Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   But Victory Gallop acted more like Easy Goer, who was second to
Sunday Silence in the '89 Derby and Preakness but won the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, who finished 2\ lengths behind Kent Desormeaux and
Real Quiet in the Preakness, sensed a new attitude in his horse
during the post parade on a sunny afternoon on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like a different horse today,'' Stevens said. ``He
grabbed hold of the bridle like he was really eager to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the race was so close it took a photo to determine the
winner, Victory Gallop, the second favorite at 9-2 odds, was the
superior horse in the 1{-mile Test of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet had the advantage of post position _ eighth as
opposed to Victory Gallop's 11th. And the sluggish pace (the
half-mile of 48.6 seconds was the third-slowest Belmont in the past
10 years) worked to the detriment of the come-from-Pluto style of
Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   It was no easy trip for Stevens, who finished second on Silver
Charm in last year's Belmont. Victory Gallop was bumped by Yarrow
Brae at the start and was 10th _ eight lengths behind _ at the
half-mile marker, when Real Quiet began his move.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the leader was Chilito, who is owned by
Houston/Washington, D.C., attorney Joe Albritton.
</P>
<P>
   Chilito's jockey, Robbie Davis, said, ``I thought we had it when
we started opening up around the far turn. Then I saw Real Quiet
draw alongside of us and pull away. I thought there was going to be
a Triple Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw Victory Gallop pass us with his ears pricked. When
I saw that, I said to myself, `Oh, man.' He made such a powerful
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet took the lead with a quarter-mile to go. Desormeaux
said he had ``a perfect spot early, running between horses. There
was no sand in his face. He was in a canter. He was breezing to the
front.''
</P>
<P>
   But with one furlong left, Desormeaux knew he ``was in trouble.
The momentum was changing; he was starting to slow down. I do think
I was a bit premature with my move.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop's trainer, Elliott Walden, said, ``We wanted Real
Quiet to make his move, expend the energy and see if we could pick
up the pieces late. And that's how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   With a mighty surge through the middle of the track, Victory
Gallop reeled in The Fish. But as he tried to pass, a tiring Real
Quiet lunged out, bumping Victory Gallop and upsetting his stride.
</P>
<P>
   And three lengths from the finish, Real Quiet stepped out of
line again, body-blocking his rival and prompting an objection from
Stevens, who didn't know for sure if his closing act was enough to
nip the 4-5 favorite at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   It really didn't matter whose nose was in front, because Real
Quiet's foul was so flagrant that the stewards said they would have
disqualified him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he'd feel about taking down a Triple Crown, John Joyce
of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board said, ``The
judgment can't be interpreted because of the Triple Crown. The
facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's trainer, the not-too-quiet Bob Baffert, had
``guaranteed'' a win but offered no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fish floundered,'' he said. ``He flattened out in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bred for distance,'' he said. ``They're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Real Quiet's sire, Quiet American, was a fine miler but
not a long-distance runner. But Cryptoclearance, who stands at the
Tall Oaks Farm in Canada, was second to Bet Twice in the '87
Belmont. His son did him one better.
</P>
<P>
   The Prestons bought Victory Gallop last November with pedigree
in mind. Although they own one of the nation's top-ranked sprinters
in Distorted Humor, they are more involved in breeding than racing.
They own about 50 broodmares and six stallions.
</P>
<P>
   Art Preston, 58, said, ``This brings a lot of visibility to our
breeding operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prestons sell all their yearlings and race only horses that
already have established their ability to run.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop was originally sold as a yearling for $25,000,
but Prestonwood Farms bought him last November after other owners
refused to meet the asking price of $500,000. The colt had an
enlarged sesamoid bone in his ankle, and some horsemen thought he
would soon break down.
</P>
<P>
   But the Prestons had the colt inspected by veterinarians and
determined the condition was not career-threatening. They believed
Victory Gallop, a late foal (born May 30, 1995), would steadily
improve, and they've been proved right, as Saturday's $600,000
payoff would attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we win in a photo,'' Art Preston said. ``How exciting
can it get?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Real Quiet's bid for immortality, Preston got the last
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fine horse,'' he said, ``but he's not a Triple Crown
champion, or he wouldn't have let us beat him.''

Boat's True Value victory indisputable
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FORT WORTH _ A.J. Foyt didn't have to fight off anyone in Victory
Circle this time.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat, who drives the Conseco Dallara/Aurora for Foyt's
team, left no doubt about who the winner was in the True Value 500
on Saturday night at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd of 105,000 on its feet, Boat outdueled Plano's
Greg Ray in the final laps to win the race one year after victory
was taken away from Boat in a bizarre scoring snafu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is vindication for us,'' Boat said after earning his
first victory in the Pep Boys Indy Racing League. ``We really
wanted to win worse than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left here a winner last year, and I woke up the next morning
in second place. I wasn't going to let that happen this year. We
never gave up all night long. I had a great race car, and I ran it
to death.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Foyt was all smiles as he hugged Boat, who won
$130,250 for the victory. It was much different from one year ago
when Foyt slapped Arie Luyendyk to the ground as Luyendyk walked
into Victory Circle and screamed he was the real winner. Luyendyk
was declared the winner the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we won it last year,'' said Foyt, the Houston racing
legend who won the Indianapolis 500 four times. ``All I can say is
Billy drove a hell of a race in this one. Today was our day.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt also was proud of his other driver _ Kenny Brack _ who
finished third in the No. 14 Power Team car. Boat, Ray and Brack
finished Saturday's race the way they started on the front row at
Indianapolis two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Boat and Ray who went wheel-to-wheel in the last 10
laps of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who drives the AT&AMP;T Wireless Dallara/Aurora, used the
slower car of Buzz Calkins to get past Boat in turn 3 with seven
laps left in the 500-kilometer, 208-lap race. But Boat regained the
lead for good one lap later when he passed Ray at almost the same
spot on the track as Ray got by him. Boat finished .926 seconds
ahead of Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy was just faster on top and I could barely stay with him
in the draft,'' said Ray, who had his best finish in an IRL event.
``But second place is a victory for us. We're very excited. This is
a Cinderella story for us. This is a victory for the small teams.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-car battle between Boat and pole-sitter Tony Stewart came
to and end with 33 laps to go when Stewart blew an engine while
running second behind Boat.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive year at TMS that Stewart lost an
engine late in the race. It happened in 1997, when he was leading
with two laps to go. Stewart also blew an engine while leading the
Indy 500 two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was in control before he lost fifth gear, allowing Boat
to gradually make up a two-second deficit. Boat was making laps at
record speeds, including one lap at 227.273 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But Boat flirted with disaster when he bumped into the side of
rookie J.J. Yeley, who was several laps down. Stewart scooted back
in front of Boat on the restart at lap 149, but Boat regained the
lead when he got inside of Stewart on turn 1 on lap 155. The two
men continued to trade places, including two lead changes on lap
159, before Stewart's engine gave out.
</P>
<P>
   The race barely was under way when Billy Roe spun into the grass
as the green-flag was waved. But the real problem came on lap 5
when six cars were involved in a crash on the backstretch after the
restart.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Guerrero started to spin and hit the wall, causing a
chain reaction behind him. Donnie Beechler rammed into the back of
Stephan Gregoire and collected Indy 500 winner Eddie Cheever in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Boesel hit the wall and destroyed the right side of his
car, and Yeley lost the nose of his car in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all my fault,'' Guerrero said. ``I got loose out of
turn 2 and lost it and caused all the confusion. We had clutch
problem, but unfortunately I can't use that as an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero and Cheever ended up against the inside wall, and
Guerrero's Dallara/Aurora flipped over on its top. But Guerrero was
unhurt, and all the other drivers in the accident walked away
without an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking ahead and saw Guerrero hit wall,'' Cheever said.
``Everybody started panicking, and I had no where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeley, the youngest driver in the field at 23, felt some of the
older drivers should have been more patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got sideways and got into Boesel and cracked the gearbox,''
Yeley said. ``A lot of guys were a little rambunctious too early in
the race. It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dismore, who hit the wall in turn 1 on lap 71, suffered a
mild concussion and was flown by helicopter to Parkland Hospital in
Dallas.

FOYT ENJOYS VICTORY WITHOUT CONTROVERSY

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A.J. Foyt has his True Value 500K trophy,
and he didn't have to beat anybody up to get it.
</P>
<P>
   All Foyt had to do was sit back and watch as Billy Boat beat the
field in the Conseco A.J. Foyt Racing Dallara/Aurora last night at
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Foyt scuffled with Arie Luyendyk over a scoring gaffe
by the U.S. Auto Club, which stripped Boat of the inaugural trophy
a day later and gave it to Luyendyk after reviewing the scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was more fun last year,'' Foyt said with a smile,
alluding to the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there were no questions, no fisticuffs, no problems _
only sweet vindication for a proud Texan, as another of his
drivers, Kenny Brack, finished third in the Power Team Racing
Dallara/Aurora/Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this race as bad as we wanted Indy after what
happened last year,'' said Foyt, a four-time Indianapolis 500
winner. ``Last year, as far as I was concerned we ran 1-2, and this
year we ran 1-3, so you can't really holler. I thought last year
was the same way (a win), so we were going to make damn sure it was
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the revision in last year's finish, Foyt driver Davey
Hamilton had been scored as finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   But all that was history last night as Boat claimed his first
career victory in the Indy Racing League after winning the pole at
the Indianapolis 500. He finished 23rd in that race after suffering
gear-box problems.
</P>
<P>
   For Foyt it was a worthwhile homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Foyt raced Indycars at Texas World Speedway in
College Station, where he won Indycar and stock-car races. Foyt has
won more Indy-style races, at 67, than any other driver and was the
first inductee in the Motorsports Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted to being slightly nervous about racing again in his
home state; Foyt's racing operation is in his hometown of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're in your home state, you want to do good, but
normally that's where you do the worst,'' Foyt said. ``So this
means a lot to me.''

Astros' Lima shuts out Royals
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Spring-training exhibitions rarely hold much meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But Jose Lima remembers every detail.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to forget a pitching line that included nine hits,
nine runs and two walks _ in 2 innings. That's the damage the
Kansas City Royals inflicted on Lima during a 15-0 pounding in
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was payback,'' Lima said Saturday after pitching a
five-hitter for his first career shutout in a 6-0 victory over the
Royals at the Astrodome. ``It isn't that I have anything against
the Kansas City Royals, but I remember how embarrassed I was when I
gave up nine runs. My career was in jeopardy. I almost blew my
chance to be a starting pitcher this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months later, Lima has emerged as the biggest
surprise of the season for the Astros, who remained in a
first-place tie with the red-hot Chicago Cubs in the National
League Central. The shutout was the fifth of the season by an
Astros pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio went 2-for-5 with three runs batted in, including a
two-run homer in the third inning that provided Lima all the
offensive support he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (7-2), who also lost to Kansas City in his major-league
debut with the Detroit Tigers in 1994, retired nine of the first 11
batters he faced and only allowed one runner to reach third base.
The 25-year-old Dominican walked one and struck out seven for his
first victory in nearly a month. Lima hadn't won since May 10 at
Milwaukee, a span of one loss and three straight no-decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Not until he struck out Dean Palmer to end the game and the
crowd of 25,516 erupted into a loud cheer did Lima realize he had
thrown his first complete game in the majors. Having spent most of
his career as a reliever, Lima needed 34 starts to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about it,'' said Lima, who lowered his ERA
to 2.99. ``I knew about the shutout, but I didn't even think about
the complete game because with it 6-0, I thought they were going to
take me out. Look how I finished. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lima walked with one out in the third inning, the Astros
brushed the cobwebs off their bats with Biggio's eighth home run of
the season, a two-run shot to left field off Royals lefthander Jose
Rosado (1-5), a former junior-college standout at Galveston
Community College. Biggio, who is batting .316, added a two-out RBI
single in the fifth to put the Astros ahead 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the third inning, the Astros had scored only one run in
their last 22 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to stay back, swing hard, and I got a pitch to
hit. I was lucky,'' Biggio said of his home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros erupted for three more runs in the sixth inning,
highlighted by Carl Everett's two-run single. Jeff Bagwell led off
with a single to center field, and Moises Alou reached base when
Kansas City shortstop Luis Rivera, a former Astro, bobbled a
grounder. Bagwell advanced to third when Rosado's pickoff attempt
at second landed in center field, and Everett cleared the bases
with the first of his two hits in the game. Ricky Gutierrez added
an RBI double for Houston's final run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to wake our bats up. We've had three great starts by
our pitchers, and it was a night when we helped them,'' said
Everett, who added a pair of defensive gems in center field. ``If
this team hits and the pitching continues to do what it's doing,
we're going to be right where we are supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker continued his approach of allowing
his starters to go as deep into the game as possible by allowing
Lima to throw 126 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Lima, who had never pitched beyond 7 innings, was
never in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The only runner to advance to third for Kansas City came in the
fifth inning when Jermaine Dye reached base on an infield hit and
advanced two bases on Lima's wild pickoff throw to first. Lima
struck out Sal Fasano and got Rivera to ground out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff King doubled for Kansas City to lead off the seventh, but
Lima struck out the next two batters and retired pinch hitter Larry
Sutton on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   With nine more innings to their credit, Astros starters are
second in the NL behind Atlanta with 390 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last seven innings were the best I've ever seen him
pitch,'' Dierker said of Lima. ``(Kansas City) doesn't have the
most powerful lineup, but the way he was pitching he could have
pitched a shutout against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence, Lima said, has allowed him to concentrate
solely on pitching, instead of worrying about whether his days as a
starter are numbered like he did in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if they gave me the opportunity, I was going to take
advantage,'' said Lima, who has pitched seven or more innings in
eight of his 13 starts. ``That gave me the confidence to go out
there and finish the game. I thank my teammates, especially
(catcher) Brad Ausmus and (pitching coach) Vern Ruhle. They've been
the key for me all year and helped keep myself under control.''

TMS EARNS STRIPES FROM INDY DRIVERS; NASCAR'S NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The official benediction won't come until
Rusty and Dale and the boys mosey back into town sometime next
year, but let me be the first to declare, from this day forward,
that Texas Motor Speedway is now an authorized whine-free race
track.
</P>
<P>
   Forevermore, side-by-side racing, speed without end, amen.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least until a blown engine do us part.
</P>
<P>
   Please, no more crying from the Winston Cup boys about how Texas
tough this track is. No more sniffling about unforgiving Turn 4. No
more fretting about the sweating in Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   No more crabbing and sniveling, period.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we say it? Of course we dare.
</P>
<P>
   Just shut up and drive.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Pep Boys Indy Racing League did last night in
the True Value 500K, and if these guys can do it at 225 mph and
more, it ought to be good enough for the Winston Cup laddies, too.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat, withstanding a late challenge from Plano resident
Greg Ray, won the True Value 500K for the A.J. Foyt racing team.
And this time there were no challengers to provoke a post-race,
winner's circle brawl. This time Boat, who was initially declared
the 1997 winner, won't lose to a computer recount.
</P>
<P>
   Boat's victory on a night when lap speeds at times topped 227
mph added to the irony that hung over TMS all weekend like a cloud
of gas fumes. Two months after the ongoing feud between the Winston
Cup drivers and the speedway threatened to break out into outright
hostilities in April, a ``new'' Texas Motor Speedway debuted.
</P>
<P>
   Almost $3 million in renovations _ the turns were torn up and
reconfigured, the track was repaved and a drainage system was
installed _ had drivers in the Pronto Auto Parts 400K and the IRL
True Value 500K raving about the track to the point that many were
all but complaining about how boring it was to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get around here,'' Tony Stewart said, almost
yawning, after winning the pole for the True Value 500K in
qualifying Friday. ``I was thinking what I wanted to eat for lunch
after I got done.''
</P>
<P>
   A bologna sandwich, maybe, but a nice little dig at the NASCAR
boys just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, running full-out almost all night, kept his
Glidden/Menards Special near the lead until blowing an engine on
the 176th lap of the 208-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had talked lovingly of the ``gentle transitions'' while
television analyst Tom Sneva cautioned that the drivers could be
lulled into a false sense of security by the smoothness of the
track. ``It becomes a focus problem,'' Sneva said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously we're not talking about the same track that one
Winston Cup driver suggested in April should be ``padlocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we're just not talking about the same kind of drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all those NASCAR drivers to blame their crashes on the
racetrack, that's pretty sad. That's what a steering wheel is
for,'' Ray said after his best IRL finish ever last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys (the IRL drivers) said last year that this was a
fun, easy track for them,'' TMS general manager Eddie Gossage
shrugged as the True Value 500K unfolded in front of an estimated
100,000 race fans. ``The changes have only made it better.
Obviously, we're quite pleased with what we're hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gossage realizes that this is only the prelims. The final
word should and must come from the Winston Cuppers. That's what
will make or break this track, and everyone understands and
concedes that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Dale (Earnhardt) and Rusty (Wallace) and that bunch cast
their vote,'' Gossage said, ``we'll just take a wait-and-see
attitude. For us to hear what we've heard this weekend is
gratifying, but it doesn't mean the Winston dilemma is solved.
We'll have to hear it from them.''
</P>
<P>
   A concern here was that TMS, in finally grasping that it could
not win a public relations war with Winston Cup drivers, would lose
its character as it reconfigured to make things easier. While the
NASCAR drivers talked longingly about the wide-open spaces on
tracks in California and Las Vegas, some of us didn't see anything
wrong with a track that was barbed-wire tough and challenging.
</P>
<P>
   But in making the changes, without giving up its beloved
24-degree banks, TMS may have finally gotten the best of both
worlds _ a rugged, challenging track that allows
pedal-to-the-metal, side-by-side, thrill-a-minute racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to the drivers and tried to give them what they
wanted,'' Gossage said. ``A smoother track, easier transitions,
wider turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're running at 190 miles per hour, that's not easy no
matter where you're at or what you're doing. By design, this track
is not nearly as wide or as much like a boulevard as (California
and Las Vegas) are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should it be.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with a little Texas character, you see.
</P>
<P>
   Come on back to town next April, boys. We'll be tickled pink to
see you again.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, this is now an official whine-free zone.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For the first 33 laps of last night's True
Value 500K, a bigger, renovated and rejuvenated Texas Motor
Speedway was like a bully walking through a playground.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the 28 Indy Racing League drivers who started the race
had their lunch stolen early.
</P>
<P>
   After three early caution flags produced a smaller field, TMS
turned into a kinder, gentler speedway the rest of the night. The
race finished with six cautions for a total of 45 laps and seven
drivers out of the race because of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine out there, but there is nothing you can do if people
are spinning in front of you,'' said Raul Boesel, who crashed early
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The first crash came on the fifth lap and knocked Roberto
Guerrero, Stephan Gregoire, Donnie Beechler, Raul Boesel and
Indianapolis 500 champion Eddie Cheever from the race. J.J. Yeley's
car sustained nose damage, but he returned to the race.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, in the No. 21 Dallara/Aurora with new sponsorship from
Nokia, spun as he exited Turn 2 and hit the wall. As his car came
off the wall and back toward the middle of the track, a pack of
four cars started spinning to try to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, in the No. 51 Rachel's Team Cheever Dallara/Aurora, and
Gregoire's No. 77 Blue Star Batteries G Force/Aurora, braked when
they saw Guerrero spin ahead of them. That left Beechler, in the
No. 98 Cahill G Force/Aurora, nowhere to go, and he ran into the
back of Gregoire's right rear tire, flipping him over. Cheever and
Boesel, who started together in the 10th row, tried slowing down
but couldn't avoid the wreck. Boesel, in McCormack Motorsports' No.
30 G Force/Aurora said he was hit from behind, which caused him to
spin and crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all my fault,'' Guerrero said. ``I just got loose out
of (Turn) 2 and spun. We developed a clutch problem early, but I
can't use that as an excuse. I have no idea what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the smoke cleared and emergency crews made it to the
scene, Beechler's car was turned upside down. The other four cars
had too much damage to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those deals where you're so close at speeds so
fast that if anything happens, it's going to take out a few cars,''
Beechler said. ``We happened to be the unlucky guys involved in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, who started in Row 4, was the highest qualifier to
crash.
</P>
<P>
   None of the drivers were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a group of four cars, everyone trying to avoid it,''
Cheever said. ``At 200 mph, you don't have much choice of what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisio Salazar, in the No. 15 Reebok Riley and Scott/Aurora,
caused a fourth caution at lap 33 when he had engine failure in
Turn 1 and went up against the wall. Drivers ran the 39 laps
without a caution before Mark Dismore spun his No. 28 Kelley
Automotive Dallara/Aurora in Turn 1, hit the wall and could not
return.
</P>
<P>
   Dismore sustained a slight concussion and was taken to Parkland
Memorial Hospital in Dallas.

RANGERS SHUT OUT PADRES, 3-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ San Diego Padres second baseman Quilvio Veras
stepped to the plate with two outs and the bases loaded in what
would be the pivotal seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers left-hander Eric Gunderson and right-hander Danny
Patterson continued throwing in the bullpen, yet manager Johnny
Oates summoned neither. The manager stayed with right-hander John
Burkett, who entered this contest with the second-highest
earned-run average among American League qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett justified the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Veras took a called third strike on a 1-2 fastball from Burkett
in what would be the Padres' best and only threat during the
Rangers' 3-0 victory last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on the way Burkie was throwing the ball,'' Oates said.
``Certainly, the numbers suggest you want to turn Veras around in
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Veras, a switch hitter who entered the game hitting 38 points
better against right-handers, came to the plate with one hit in
three previous at-bats against Burkett. However, Veras sent center
fielder Roberto Kelly deep into the gap in right-center field
during his third-inning at-bat and forced left fielder Rusty Greer
into a sliding catch with a sixth-inning line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, though, opposed Gunderson entering that seventh-inning
situation with Ken Caminiti and Ruben Rivera available on the
Padres' bench and never considered Patterson to face Veras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that (Burkett) was the best pitcher for that situation,
regardless of what the outcome was,'' said Oates, whose Rangers
possessed a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (4-5) also received support three batters earlier from
catcher Ivan Rodriguez in what Oates described as ``the defensive
play of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres first baseman Wally Joyner began the seventh inning with
a single and advanced to second on a single by right fielder Mark
Sweeney. Padres manager Bruce Bochy then attempted to advance both
runners into scoring position by calling for a sacrifice bunt from
third baseman Ed Giovanola.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanola got the bunt down, but Rodriguez sprang from behind
the plate and, despite being off balance, fired a strike to third
baseman Fernando Tatis to retire Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodriguez made a great play on the bunt,'' Bochy said. ``He
might be the only catcher able to make that play. It was a big play
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Luis Alicea, who replaced injured second
baseman Mark McLemore in the fourth inning, delivered the decisive
base hit _ a two-run, fifth-inning double against Padres
left-hander Sterling Hitchcock (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that he was throwing a lot of off-speed pitches so I
was looking for one that wasn't too low,'' said Alicea, who shot a
2-1 pitch between Giovanola and the foul line. ``He gave it to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth inning to record
his 16th save in 17 opportunities this season, but this evening
belonged to Burkett (4-5).
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who retired 11 consecutive batters during a
stretch between the first and fourth innings, allowed only five
hits and one walk in his 118-pitch appearance. It also gave hope
that he may be nearing the pitcher who dominated in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw very well the other night in Tampa,'' Oates said in
reference to the Rangers' 4-1 loss to the Devil Rays. ``If you
could take back one pitch (a three-run homer to center fielder
Quinton McCracken), he might have pitched a shutout the last time,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett credited pitching coach Dick Bosman with an alteration
in his delivery from the stretch for the recent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My control has gotten a lot better, and my slider has been 10
times better,'' Burkett said. ``It was useless before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three or four games, I've been throwing a lot better.
It's been a slow process, and we've got a long way to go. This is a
nice sign. Hopefully, I can be consistent from here on out.''

RAY COMES UP SHORT, BUT IMPRESSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM PEDLEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Shoes don't last long on the feet of Ginger
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``See these?'' she said. ``I got them just before the
Indianapolis 500,'' two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look,'' she said displaying a sole with a large hole worn
away.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is pacing. Nervous pacing. The kind of nervous
pacing that comes with being the mother of a son who makes his
living driving 225 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Ray secretly hopes her son Greg's Indy Racing League
career is a short but healthy one. ``He has two kids and a wife,''
Ginger Ray said. And a mom who gets sick to her stomach on race day
and wants her son to return to the family marine business in Plano,
even though he finished second last night in the True Value 500K at
Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may have to wait a while,'' said Greg Ray, after his
impressive performance at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Ray started from the 14th spot and steadily worked his way up
toward the front, running among the top three for most of the 208
laps of the event.
</P>
<P>
   He ran second for a good chunk of the final few laps, and
battled with race winner, Billy Boat, when the race was on the
line. On lap 200, he passed Boat to take the lead, but was repassed
a short time later and had to settle for second place _ which he
gladly did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a victory for us,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing a better run at Boat was the fact that the winner had
a bit more gear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making Ray even happier was the fact he qualified poorly and
also overcame a problem in the pits during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our qualifying effort just didn't go the way we wanted it
to,'' he said. ``Then, we killed the motor on pit lane. We made
some mistakes, but we were still able work our way back from 18th''
place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was having a huge night on a track a few miles from
his hometown of Plano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, in front of the hometown fans, this is great,'' Ray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's place in the IRL series appears to be solidifying. He
earned a place on front row at Indy and was running strong in the
race until a broken gear ended his chance for what he believes
would have been a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we were going to win Indy,'' he said. ``I thought
we were the best car out there. Now, we are second-best here. You
are going to see some pretty good results from this car.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray hopes sponsors and potential sponsors are seeing those
results right now. His team lost a major sponsor before Indy. That
sponsor, he said, wanted his team to change personnel and tire
brands. Ray refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small team,'' Ray said. ``The first thing we needed
to do was focus on people. The former sponsor wanted to get rid of
Firestone and (team manager Tom) Knapp. I believe in them, so'' Ray
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up another major sponsor before the TMS race, but the
deal with that company, ATT Wireless, was just for last night's
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this performance gets the excited,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't appear to get Ginger Ray too excited. As her son
battled for the victory over the final laps, she buried her head in
her hands, and her hands into the iron fence that surrounds the
victory circle. She sobbed and shook as she did so.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my biggest fan,'' Greg Ray said, a touch of sarcasm in
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not ``the'' biggest. The Rays had to get 75 tickets
for friends from Plano, and his garage area has been besieged by
well-wishers this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see him do good,'' Ginger Ray said, ``and get
what he wants out of it, and then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Ray's probably right. It could be a while.

KARL CAN TALK TO CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ George Karl has been given official permission by
the Seattle SuperSonics to talk to the Clippers about their
head-coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Karl, who was fired by the Sonics last month, is under
contract to Seattle until July 1, he is allowed to speak to the
Clippers and Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   But if any other team _ such as the Lakers or Chicago Bulls _ is
interested in Karl, it must still receive permission from the
Sonics until his contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   Karl's interest in the Clippers remains debatable, as he waits
to see what other coaching positions become available.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who could seek as much as $5 million per season, said in
an interview this week he was willing to lower his asking price for
one of the league's plum jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money has never been a part of my philosophy in looking for a
job. I would go someplace where we have a chance to win a
championship for a lot less money,'' Karl told the Seattle Times.
``It's never been money. I think it will happen. I will coach in
the NBA next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers already owe former coach Bill Fitch $2 million for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clippers have appeared to be in no hurry to hire,
they might have to move up their timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' second choice, Paul Westphal, is now a candidate
to replace Karl in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, who is good friends with Seattle general manager Wally
Walker, said he thinks both teams will hire a coach in the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect something will happen pretty soon,'' Westphal said.
``Both teams have said they want to have a coach in place before
the draft (June 24).''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some speculation that Westphal expects to land
one of the two openings because he has put his house in Phoenix up
for sale. But Westphal said he has always intended to move, because
his son is about to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Draft workouts: The Clippers, who have two first-round picks,
have been busy working out players as the draft nears.
</P>
<P>
   Their expected No.1 pick, Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, will
come to Los Angeles this week for his pre-draft workout. He will be
represented by super-agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have already worked out Kansas swingman Paul
Pierce, Pacific center Michael Olowokandi, Michigan forward Robert
Traylor, UCLA center Jelani McCoy, Ball State guard Bonzi Wells and
Cincinnati guard Ruben Patterson, among others.
</P>
<P>
   According to several sources, Pierce has had the most impressive
workout so far. If the Clippers aren't desperate for a point guard,
he might sneak into their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of basketball operations Elgin Baylor was in
Chicago this weekend for the pre-draft camp that included more than
60 potential draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players that Baylor was able to watch were McCoy,
guard Bryce Drew of Valparaiso, Arizona guard Miles Simon, high
school star Korleone Young, St. John's guard Felipe Lopez and
UCLA's J.R. Henderson and Toby Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the No.1 overall pick, the Clippers also have the 22nd
selection, acquired from Miami in the Isaac Austin-Brent Barry
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Drew, who improved his stock with good performances
in Chicago, would help the Clippers strengthen their backcourt and
should be available. Drew can also play the point, another plus for
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   They also wouldn't mind seeing McCoy drop to No.22, which would
provide insurance in case free-agent center Austin signs with
another team.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were also in Chicago, with executives Jerry West and
Mitch Kupchak and coach Del Harris all in attendance.

SUN DEVILS SHOW METTLE IN TITLE LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Usually when the score is 21-14, the bands march
onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over.
</P>
<P>
   After one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ``nine''
home runs that lit up the scoreboard like touchdowns, the College
World Series finally came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with 7-foot radio announcer Tom Dore wondering whether
it ever would. ``When the game started,'' Dore mused, ``I was
6-5.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended after four head-shaking, record-breaking hours, with
the Sun Devils telling themselves before their last at-bat that
maybe they still could find a way to do it. To come back. Again.
One more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Nine.'' That was Arizona State's motto this year. Never
concede. Fight to the finish. Play all nine.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Murphy's team showed that unsinkable spirit in Saturday's
national championship game. ASU trailed Southern California, 8-0,
before starting pitcher Ryan Mills could break a sweat. The Sun
Devils made the score 8-5. The Trojans went up, 9-5. The Sun Devils
closed to 9-8. The Trojans struck again, 14-8. The Sun Devils
answered, 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Michael Collins, who hit a grand slam, and his
teammates were like those irrepressible salesmen Dagwood Bumstead
is always battling. The Trojans couldn't shut the door because of a
hand, a knee, an elbow, a foot.
</P>
<P>
   But ASU finally lost the battle. This dream season ended,
ironically, in the ninth when USC's Jason Lane came to the plate
with the bases loaded and ripped an offering from ASU's Chuck
Crumpton to the deepest part of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ASU center fielder Rudy Arguelles went to the wall. Eyed the
ball. Jumped for it in vain. His raised glove looked like a hand
disappearing in the deep. Four more runs. Trojans, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   This is a curious business, sportswriting, deciding whom to
bless and whom to blame. Some will pin it all on Mills. In the
final and biggest game of his college career, the ASU ace wasn't
the pitcher who overpowered the Trojans the last time he faced
them, striking out 15. Mills didn't have his fastball. At the end
of this long season, his arm was on empty.
</P>
<P>
   Mills couldn't get anyone out. But neither could the Sun Devils'
other pitchers, and they used five.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good hitting team,'' Mills said in the
understatement of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans won because they pounded out 23 hits and made big
plays, and perhaps none was bigger or bolder than their triple
steal with two outs in the seventh inning. One run scored. Two more
followed when Wes Rachels hit a single. For you investors, Rachels,
who went 5 for 7 with seven RBIs, is listed on the stock exchange
as Hitters Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were the better team. ASU's Pac-10 rivals earned the
right to celebrate, and when the game finally ended, here they
came, racing from the dugout and jumping into a joyous pile.
</P>
<P>
   For those in the ASU dugout, the scene was difficult to watch.
The defeat left this team feeling hollow inside. But nothing is
more resilient than youth. In time, the Devils will be able to look
back on this season and smile. They should feel good about what
they accomplished and what they became, a team.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unique group. Arguelles, the center fielder, is 26
years old. Andrew Beinbrink, the third baseman who hit three home
runs in four games, makes his own clothes. The catcher, Greg
Halvorson, from Tucson, was drafted as a pitcher. Mikel Moreno, a
former two-time all-state quarterback at Mesa High School, plays
baseball as if every play, every at-bat, is a crucial third down in
the fourth quarter of a tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Collins? His baseball cap is stained with the whitish residue of
a season of perspiration. ``I've washed it a few times,'' he said
the other day. But Collins never asked for a new one. Didn't want
one. This one said what he, and this team, is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ASU played one of the nation's toughest schedules. The Sun
Devils won three in a row in the regionals to stay alive. They came
to Omaha as the No. 6 seed and won three games and were in the last
one until that metallic thonk in the ninth sent the ball rising
into the blue sky and it disappeared over the center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy game. Great season. The Sun Devils did what Murphy asked.
They kept their heads down, and played hardball. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Once is OK. Twice is a trend. A few more times and his
legacy drops to garden-variety postal clerk.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight year, Karl Malone is struggling when
needed the most. Clanking shots. Looking skittish. A shadow of his
statistical self. And you have to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or pattern? Champion or Charles Barkley?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any excuses,'' Malone said. ``But we will not win
this series if I don't play better.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Utah Jazz flushed away home-court advantage on Friday,
it marked the first time in 60 games they had lost when entering
the fourth quarter with a lead. It also happened to be a game where
Malone didn't score a field goal in the final 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You can rave about the Bulls' rotating defense, Dobermans
interfering with normal delivery, double teams arriving like a
steady swarm of mosquitoes. But superstars find a way to get it
done. When the shot isn't working, they navigate their way to the
foul line. They do something.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is doing nothing, and it's not like he's bumping heads
with Bill Russell, either.
</P>
<P>
   He is being checked by Luc Longley, a wonderful fellow with his
feet stuck in cement. He is being stymied by Dennis Rodman, a
creature he used to pancake in the past. In a singular moment, he
couldn't even control the blocks against Scottie Pippen, instead
drawing an offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   So Malone is taking the easy way out, launching jumpers, hoping
instead of competing. He is shooting under 35 percent for the
series, and that number is inflated thanks to an array of layups
and dunks courtesy of John Stockton. And his production in Game 2
was more Muresan than Malone: Five baskets, five fouls, four
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I'm more content to be
perimeter-oriented,'' Malone said. ``But all year long, I've made
those shots. Kind of comes at a (expletive) time to not make them.
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the core of Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he didn't fare well in the Western Conference Finals
against Seattle. Last year, after carting off his first MVP trophy,
questions arose about his mental toughness in a subpar series
against the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Now this.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if it's just a slump. Or the indomitable presence of
Michael Jordan. Or the big stage simply shrinking the country boy
from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Malone admitted he was nervous last year, but a six-game tour of
the NBA Finals should've been enough to dislodge the apple in his
throat. Malone stunk in Game 1, although that performance was
easily attributable to a 10-game layoff. But he cost his team
dearly in Game 2 because if Malone had any kind of night, the Jazz
might have the Bulls in a half-nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one time that you want to have excuses, this would
be my time to make up some,'' Malone said. ``But I don't have any.
I'm just not playing well right now, and its come at an unfortunate
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Malone wasn't alone in Game 2. He and his friends were
spectators in the first half, a team that waved their capes when
the Bulls charged to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Toni) Kukoc drove around us like we weren't even on the
floor,'' Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said. ``That tells you right away
that you're not ready to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Jazz got it right. Except for Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things I could've done,'' he said. ``I take
responsibility for that. It's on these shoulders, and when I don't
do it, I face the firing squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he has always been a stand-up guy.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a decade, Malone has prided himself on a
subjective concept, the traits that make one a man. For Malone, it
has been a collection of steely confidence, impenetrable will,
fierce independence and a garage full of motorcycles. But more than
anything, he has presented himself as a man who will do his job
with amazing consistency, unburdened by fear or intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   No one would dare argue. Until now. And with the postage long
overdue, you have to wonder. &QL;

USC BLITZES DEVILS WITH 21-RUN AT TACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ It was less a battle than an arms race. Whose
pitching could hold out longer?
</P>
<P>
   After an amazing run, Arizona State ran out of steam in the
worst of places: the College World Series, against Southern
California, a team that can rival the Sun Devils for perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans won a four-hour tug of war, 21-14, Saturday in front
of a record 24,456 fans at Rosenblatt Stadium and prevented ASU
from capturing its sixth national title and first under Coach Pat
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, you just don't think there's life after baseball,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unlikely ending. In addition to 35 runs, the teams
combined for 39 hits, nine home runs, six wild pitches and, maybe
most telling, 10 pitchers. Thirty-five tournament records fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about it was crazy,'' ASU pitcher Ryan Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   It was USC's 12th national title _ the most by any school _ and
first since 1978. The Trojans advanced to the championship in 1995
before losing to Cal State-Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that feeling in '95,'' said USC second
baseman Wes Rachels, who was 5 for 7 against ASU with seven RBIs.
``I was sitting there crying and looking at the faces of the
seniors and thinking, `I never want to feel that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans continued postseason domination of ASU. They won
three previous College World Series championship games against ASU:
1-0 in 1972; 4-3 in 1973; and 10-3 in 1978. The win also gave USC a
4-3 edge over ASU this season.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the Sun Devils with moxie. They rallied from a 8-0,
second-inning deficit and trailed just 9-8 after four. They rallied
from a 14-8, sixth-inning deficit to come to within 14-13 in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored 14 runs and lost,'' Murphy said. ``It's hard to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The game never seemed out of reach until the ninth. ASU trailed,
16-14, but reliever Chuck Crumpton gave up a grand slam to Jason
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Arcadia High School graduate Jack Krawcyzk and his highly
scrutinized ``gravity ball'' kept the Sun Devils hitless for the
final 1 innings to secure his 23rd save, an NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw the pitch I've been throwing all year,'' he said. ``I
was just trying to get the job done. There was no wind and I knew
they most likely would score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU starter Mills only lasted an inning, allowing six runs and
six hits. He was followed by Aaron Kramer (five innings), Chad
Pennington (1), Phill Lowery (1) and Crumpton (two-thirds).
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I was warming up that I didn't have it,'' Mills
said. ``But I was going to go out there and give it everything I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Krawcyzk, USC's pitchers also struggled, but the
offense more than made up for it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the grand slam, a seventh-inning triple steal
also seemed to zap life out of ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ASU didn't have the hits, but it had the karma. Murphy had in
his possession a ring from the 1977 ASU championship team. He
received it from Bob Horner, a second baseman from that club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still accomplished a lot,'' third baseman Andrew Beinbrink
said. ``A lot of people didn't believe in us, but we always
believed in ourselves. We played some really great baseball in the
regional and in Omaha. Today, we didn't do some of the things that
had made us successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our season says a lot for ASU and how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sun Devils made an improbable run this year. If they
had won the title, they would have had the lowest winning
percentage of any champion.
</P>
<P>
   At midseason, this team was only two games above .500. But it
battled all season and continued to find ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so proud of these guys,'' Murphy said. ``It's no fun
to lose, it's tough, but somehow you have to look for all the good
in everything. People counted this team out so many times, but they
battled back.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy again must restock a team that is losing many of its
stars, including Mills, Beinbrink and Mikel Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit USC,'' Murphy said. ``They were awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing postseason run for the Trojans, who lost their
opener to Louisiana State but came back to beat Florida and
Mississippi State. They had to beat LSU on consecutive days and
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't allow ourselves a week ago to think that we would
be playing today in the national championship,'' Gillespie said.
``This achievement for me goes beyond my ability to describe it.'' &QL;

PERPLEXED SLOAN WANTS MORE EFFORT FROM JAZZ  
 `WE LOOKED LIKE WE WERE PLAYING IN TUXEDOS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the rest of the Jazz slipped out of the practice gym
Saturday in Salt Lake City, Coach Jerry Sloan and forward Karl
Malone remained behind.
</P>
<P>
   Malone wanted to shoulder most of the blame for Utah's Game 2
loss to Chicago that allowed the Bulls to achieve a split at the
Delta Center in the first two games of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was willing to put the blame on just about anything except
Malone _ including his own coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't get them to play harder than that, maybe they need
another coach,'' Sloan said. ``That's my job. That's why coaches
get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan is tough on his players, even when they win. He seemed
downright perplexed at their effort in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like we were playing in tuxedos,'' Sloan said. ``We
didn't want to get touched. On their last three-point play, we
looked like we were in a pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``John (Stockton) said he was fouled when they stole the ball. I
don't care if there was a foul or not. You would think at this
point of it, you may want to run down the floor like we care if we
win or not.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the theme of Sloan's 40-minute meeting with his players
Saturday morning. They weren't physical enough. They didn't hustle.
They gave up too many offensive rebounds because players were more
interested in leaking out early to get an easy shot than in
crashing the boards.
</P>
<P>
   When someone pointed out to Malone that Sloan had been ``a
little short'' with reporters, Malone laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you're getting some of it, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has become the focal point of Utah's loss. He has made
only 14 of 41 shots in the first two games, and he gave himself a
``D-minus'' for his performance so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an `F' in some schools,'' he said. ``But maybe the
teacher likes me a little.''
</P>
<P>
   When Malone got off to a poor start in the Finals last year, he
cleared his mind with long rides on his Harley-Davidson. But Malone
said that causes such a stir in Salt Lake City now that he doesn't
do it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's the problem,'' he said, evoking more laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Malone admitted he hasn't played ``relaxed'' in the Finals. He
worries about forcing shots instead of getting them within the
offense. And he still believes he's going to rediscover his touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I miss a couple, I expect to make the next two or three in
a row,'' he said. ``I still believe in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Malone said, he thought he had hit a 17-foot shot that
would have given Utah the lead back after Michael Jordan's key
three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' Malone said. ``So did the other 30 shots I've
missed in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sloan's mood wasn't quite so light, he insisted that
Malone's shooting isn't Utah's biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still shot 49 percent,'' he said. ``Are we supposed to
shoot 80 percent?
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned the ball over, how many times?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty, Sloan was told, for 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned it over because we didn't know what we were doing in
our offense. We didn't defend them. And we gave up, what, 18
offensive rebounds? I have a problem with that. I have a problem
with playing like that in our own building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset. If they don't want to play hard, I don't know what
can be done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sloan said the series is far from over. The Jazz won the
first game with Malone struggling, and Utah was in position to go
up 2-0 before crumbling down the stretch in Game 2. Again, Malone
was off his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up by a point with 48 seconds to play, and he hasn't
shot the ball well yet,'' Sloan said. ``That's the exciting thing
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz must win at least one of the next three games at the
United Center to bring the series back to Utah. The Jazz get the
first opportunity today in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back and remember, I said before this started that
the little things are what win these games,'' Sloan said. ``Twenty
turnovers and 18 offensive rebounds, that's what I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Jazz players) are the ones talking about wanting to
win a championship, about getting to that next level. Talk won't
get it done.'' &QL;

MERCURY OUTWORKS STARZZ AGAIN  
 MILLER READY FOR STARS' RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The return of Michele Timms and five other
players from the World Championships next week is like Christmas
Eve to Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's in the big box under the tree, and you can't
wait to open it,'' she said of a package that holds not only the
veteran Australian point guard Timms but 6-foot-8 first-round draft
pick Maria Stepanova, 6-5 Marlies Askamp, sharpshooter Mikiko
Hagiwara and two other Australians.
</P>
<P>
   They will only add to the stash of presents Miller already has
opened and found delightful.
</P>
<P>
   That team outworked the Utah Starzz for the second time in five
days, winning, 82-64, Saturday night at the Delta Center. In the
exhibitions, the defending WNBA Western Conference champions had a
combined 35-15 edge in steals and forced twice as many turnovers
(56) as they committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defensive intensity has been phenomenal,'' guard Bridget
Pettis said. ``Our shots aren't falling (Phoenix shot 39.2 percent
from the floor), but if the offense isn't flowing we've always got
the defense to fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Foster and Brandy Reed combined for nine of the Mercury's
19 steals. Reed, a third-round draft pick, had eight steals Tuesday
in a 74-66 win at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Starzz, last in the West in 1997 and therefore recipient of
the league's No. 1 draft pick, 7-2 Malgorzata Dydek, led by seven
with 6:33 remaining in Phoenix. But the Mercury was less
intimidated by Dydek in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-1 run led to 46-33 halftime lead, which Utah cut to six
(53-47) with 13:07 remaining. Phoenix scored 12 of the next 14
points, including four by second-round draft pick Andrea Kuklova,
and the 4,696 Starzz fans spent the rest of the night rehashing the
Jazz-killing Steve Kerr rebound from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrea has a sensational game (eight points, five rebounds,
two steals),'' Miller said of the Slovakian guard/forward. ``That's
the most comfortable I've seen her and a sign she's turned the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury 6-3 centers Jennifer Gillom (19 points, seven rebounds)
and Pauline Jordan (15 point, nine boards) and 6-1 power forward
Foster (12 points, four boards) played big against Dydek in spite
of her six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dydek also had 11 points and eight rebounds, but again did not
attempt a dunk. The teams do not play the first of four
regular-season games until June 26 so seven other opponents must
defend against the inaugural slam in U.S. women's pro basketball
before the duty returns to the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Dydek) is doing more and more things,'' Miller said.
``She took two nice long shots, was looking to be aggressive and
defensively challenged everything. You could see her confidence
growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller expects most of her returners at practice Tuesday and
must reduce the roster from 18 to 11 by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix begins its 30-game regular season Thursday at
Sacramento. &QL;

ROCKY TIMES  
 DISAPPOINTING START LEAVES BAYLOR'S JOB IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arguably the biggest disappointment in the major leagues resides
in Denver's Coors Field, home of the underachieving Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, expected to seriously contend this season _
especially after acquiring pitcher  &UR; Darryl Kile and second baseman
 &UR; Mike Lansing, &UR; and keeping pitcher  &UR; Pedro Astacio _ have done
little besides lose games since a 4-1 opening week.
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten so bad that some of the most faithful fans in the
game have taken to loudly voicing their displeasure with the
Rockies at home games, which has definitely caught the players'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun,'' reigning MVP  &UR; Larry Walker said. ``It's not
fun for us, it's not fun for our manager and it's sure not fun for
our fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of boos going on, and these fans are probably
the most loyal fans in the game. To hear boos from them, it's very
frustrating. At the same time, I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Rockies lost the first two games to the Diamondbacks
last week _ looking awful in the process _ the talk shows in Denver
started calling for Manager  &UR; Don Baylor's head.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was obviously embarrassed after watching his club get
whipped by a combined score of 15-7, games in which Rockies left
fielder  &UR; Dante
 &UR; Bichette committed an ugly error when a single went under his glove
and the team generally looked flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the worst game we've played here in a long
time,'' Baylor said. ``To watch as spectators and watch as a
coaching staff and players, yeah, it's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Belief is growing that if Baylor does not straighten out the
Rockies by the All-Star Game, which will take place in Denver, he
may find himself out of a job shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest problems afflicting the Rockies include the
perception that there are two sets of rules for the players, one
for the veterans and the other for the less established players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys that never stretch or practice defense before
games,'' one Rockies player said. ``It's a joke. We're just not
that good a team.'' &QL; 
Unit offerings &QL; 
By all accounts, Seattle's  &UR; Randy Johnson is not enjoying much of a
season, at least not by his high standards. Just check out who has
hit home runs off him so far.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list is the Chicago White Sox's  &UR; Greg Norton, who
has hit two home runs off Johnson. Other notables on the list
include Detroit's  &UR; David Bell, Texas'  &UR; Damon Buford, Texas'  &UR; Bill
Simms and Anaheim's  &UR; Damon Mashore.
</P>
<P>
   They have hit six of the 10 home runs Johnson has allowed.
Otherwise, they had combined for seven other home runs entering the
weekend. &QL; 
Royal problems ahead? &QL; 
The Kansas City Royals, who have not had solid ownership since
 &UR; Ewing &UR; Kauffman passed away and have looked the part of a
small-market franchise, drafted three high-profile pitchers in last
week's draft.
</P>
<P>
   While Royals fans were bubbly with the news that Kansas City
selected
 &UR; Matt Burch, Jeff Austin and  &UR; Christopher George in the first round,
agent  &UR; Tommy Tanzer, who represents Burch, wondered aloud what the
tight-fisted Royals were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin's going to want $3 million,'' Tanzer said. ``The other
kid (George) told everybody he wanted $2 million, which is why he
fell to where he was. We didn't really set our sights on a dollar
figure. I don't think Austin has any relevance to us. The relevance
is George.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Austin is being advised by  &UR; Scott Boras, who
advised
 &UR; J.D. Drew to hold out all of last year. &QL; 
One man's view &QL; 
Hall of Fame pitcher  &UR; Bob Feller is often viewed as an ornery cuss
who has a strong disdain for the modern player. Then again, Feller
may have something valid to say when it comes to evaluating today's
players.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of his views of Feller, now 79, who began
his big league career as a 17-year-old in 1936:
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems we have in this country today is that kids
can't handle the money and notoriety. Some of them think they're
invincible, and nobody is. You have to remember the good Lord gave
you a great arm. And maybe your success has a lot to do with your
upbringing, the people and coaches who developed you along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't just fallen off the turnip truck when I started
playing. I'd played a lot of semi-pro ball in Iowa. I knew I didn't
want any hangers-on, any of the ne'er-do-wells that start coming
around. When you say no, mean it. Not everybody is able to do
that.'' &QL; 
Home improvement guy? &QL; 
Kansas City catcher  &UR; Sal Fasano was recently talking about how
obscure a player he is when he dropped this gem:
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going out one night with  &UR; Mark Gubicza and  &UR; Jeff

D-BACKS PITCH FITS AFTER SMOOTH STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ For the Diamondbacks, it was a 17-hour period worth
throwing straight into the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after suffering a demoralizing loss the night before, the
Diamondbacks showed amazing energy for four innings Saturday
afternoon before succumbing to a so-so Oakland Athletics club,
getting walloped, 10-5, in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Andy Benes, one of the handful of veterans
on the club, had a chance to pull the psyches of his young
teammates out of the stupor they were in after Friday night's 2-1
loss.
</P>
<P>
   But Benes fell apart in the fifth inning and never made it to
the sixth, heading for the showers in his shortest outing of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a first- or second-year guy throwing, you might
say, `OK,' '' Benes said. ``But I'm not a first-year guy. There's
no one to blame for this loss except me. I had to shut the door. We
needed a win today, especially when it was coupled with (Friday)
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks got slammed in the teeth the previous night
when they had Oakland beaten only to watch first base umpire Mike
Reilly refuse to call Mike Blowers out on strikes after the head of
his bat clearly went through the strike zone on a check swing that
should have ended the game and preserved a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Blowers lined a single on the next pitch, and the A's
eventually won the game in 11 innings, setting the stage for a
Saturday game where the Diamondbacks' young players were in dire
need of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, clearly the pitcher Manager Buck Showalter would have
hand-picked for Saturday's start, was on the mound and retired the
first 11 batters in a row as Arizona clung to a 1-0 lead. The
player who wants to be a clubhouse leader was leading.
</P>
<P>
   All seemed right for the fragile minds of the young players
until Benes allowed five consecutive RBI singles, and the
Diamondbacks wound up getting body-slammed.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations from the night before were evident for all to
see in the postgame clubhouse Friday when Showalter went into a fit
inside his office shortly after meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Loud, foul language and doors slamming were the highlights, as
were the stunned players in the clubhouse who heard the rare tirade
from their manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just frustrations boiling over,'' pitcher Willie Blair
said. ``Heck, we're all frustrated. There's nothing wrong with
showing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's show of emotions stemmed from his club losing a game
it practically won if Blowers is properly rung up. Showalter knows
how precious and difficult each of his club's 19 victories have
been this season. He did manage to calm down later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's here,'' Showalter said. ``So I went back to the
hotel and saw my children sleeping. It made me think that life's
too short to dwell on things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is his livelihood, and winning is the barometer by
which every major league manager is measured, even if it is an
expansion club.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's message was to let his players know it is acceptable
to let your emotions get the best of you for a moment. After all,
baseball is an emotional game, and the constant losing is getting
to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's loss set up what should have been a flat all-around
performance on Saturday. Mostly because the fragile minds of the
young players hadn't really gone through a situation like Friday's,
where a victory was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while for young players to basically learn how to
have the same concentration level every day, the one we're always
trying to obtain,'' Blair said. ``We haven't had a lot of things go
our way this year. The toughest thing in this game is to grind
every day and find ways to win. When things aren't going well, you
tend to find ways to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's outburst Friday night also came from knowing the
Diamondbacks could have been in line for a three-game sweep if they
had won Friday. It would not have been out of the question for the
A's to shrug their shoulders and say, ``Oh, well, it's just not
going to happen,'' if they had lost 1-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Diamondbacks are left with simply trying to salvage one
victory from Oakland this afternoon. Like their season, this series
has turned into ``what could have been.'' &QL;

RODRIGUEZ'S ROLE MAY DI MINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Diamondbacks reliever  &UR; Felix Rodriguez was starting to
work his way back into the good graces of Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter
and pitching coach  &UR; Mark Connor when disaster struck Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander entered the game against Oakland in the seventh
inning but gave up four runs on four hits and walked one, putting
the Diamondbacks into a hole out of which they couldn't climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felix was quietly working his way back,'' Showalter said. ``He
was pitching effectively. We hope he'll be able to come back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that Rodriguez will get a chance to be the
closer for a while. Veteran right-hander  &UR; Gregg Olson has a claim
to that role, and recently acquired right-hander  &UR; Willie Banks also
will see a considerable amount of time in middle relief, Showalter
said. &QL; 
Murphy gets greeting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks first base coach  &UR; Dwayne Murphy, who was an
outfielder with the Athletics from 1978-87 before moving on to
Detroit in 1988 and Philadelphia in 1989, was given a warm
reception by the Oakland fans during the first two games of this
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Other than an old-timers' game here in the early 1990s, this is
the only time Murphy has been back to the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of good memories here,'' Murphy said. ``It's been
a long time since I've been here and you wonder if the people
remember, but it was a nice surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy won Gold Gloves from 1980-85 while patroling center field
for the Athletics. &QL; 
Trojan triumph &QL; 
First baseman-outfielder  &UR; Mike Robertson, whose contract was
purchased by the Diamondbacks from Triple-A Tucson on Wednesday,
had his eyes glued to the TV set before Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   He was watching his alma mater, Southern California, face
Arizona State in the championship game of the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still keep in contact with (Coach  &UR; Mike) Gillespie, but I
don't follow the team like I should,'' Robertson said. ``It is nice
to see them doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the pitching. We never seem to have been able to
close it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojan pitchers had a bit of difficulty again Saturday, but
the hitters more than made up for it by pounding the Sun Devils,
21-14. &QL; 
`Coach' Bell? &QL; 
For only the second time this season,  &UR; Jay Bell did not start at
shortstop as former Oakland player Tony Batista stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Bell worked off excess energy before the game by hitting ground
balls to infielders during infield practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I've got to do something,'' he said. &QL;

STEAL OF HOME JOLTS SUN DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ It was rare. It was gutsy. And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California executed a triple steal Saturday in the
College World Series championship game that scored the first of
three seventh-inning runs and seemed to take some life out of
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, the Trojans'  &UR; Morgan Ensberg sprinted from third
base with  &UR; Chad Pennington on the mound and beat the tag. Catcher
 &UR; Greg
 &UR; Halvorson thought he had Ensberg, but umpire  &UR; Dick Runchey said no.
Base runners  &UR; Jeremy Freitas and  &UR; Seth Davidson also advanced and
later scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been accused of being smart,'' USC Coach  &UR; Mike
Gillespie said. ``Although it's a very unusual situation, I can
tell you we've done it before on more than one occasion. &QL; 
``In spite of the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, it's
remarkably successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said before the Trojans ran the play, they ``ran a
little bluff at third'' on the pitcher to see how he would
respond. &QL; 
Go figure &QL; 
How's this for a stretch?
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Kentucky won its first national championship in
basketball, Michigan its first in hockey and USC its first in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, national titles were won by Kentucky in basketball and
Michigan in hockey. USC's victory completes the trifecta. &QL; 
Sign of the times &QL; 
It proved inconsequential Saturday, but comments made Friday by ASU
Coach  &UR; Pat Murphy still were creating a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy believes USC's adeptness at stealing signs played a major
factor in pitcher  &UR; Ryan Mills' effectiveness against the Trojans in
two previous starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, Ryan got rattled because they called
pitches,'' he said. ``They got their on-deck hitter really close to
the plate and their guy in the first base box calls pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of affected Ryan, plus he really wasn't pitching
well at that point. The second time, he kind of blocked it out and
just pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that ``Ryan was tipping his pitches and our catcher
was tipping some things, too. USC is great at it (stealing signs).
They get them from all different angles and they practice it. It's
something that they've perfected, and it's part of the game. In
college ball, there's really not much you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC Coach  &UR; Mike Gillespie downplayed the comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're familiar with their signs,'' he said. ``We've
played each other six times, and we've been able to watch each
other play here. There are no secrets who can do what and how they
do it.'' &QL; 
And another thing &QL; 
Arizona State football Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder and basketball Coach
 &UR; Rob &UR; Evans flew in for the game.
</P>
<P>
   _When  &UR; Aaron Kramer hit Ensberg in the second inning, it tied
the College World Series record of batters hit by pitches (24).
</P>
<P>
   _The 10-game attendance total of 204,361 was a College World
Series record.
</P>
<P>
   _ASU's  &UR; Andrew Beinbrink, Michael Collins and  &UR; Rudy Arguelles
were members of the all-tournament team. USC's  &UR; Wes Rachels was
named the Most Outstanding Player. &QL;

WARM-UPS BAD SIGN FOR ASU ACE MILLS  
 PITCHER SAYS HE FEARED WHAT WAS TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Ryan Mills knew.
</P>
<P>
   He knew during warm-ups that his arm didn't have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt crappy against Miami, too, and I still wanted to
pitch,'' the Arizona State left-hander said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills lasted just one inning in Saturday's 21-14 College World
Series loss to Miami. He allowed six runs and six hits and struck
out one.
</P>
<P>
   Mills' postseason has been a roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   He was dominating in a complete-game three-hitter against
Georgia Tech in the Midwest Regional championship game.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the Sun Devils a solid six innings in their College
World Series contest against the Hurricanes. He wasn't as sharp as
in his previous outing, but was effective enough for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I could do it in that game, I might as well try
here,'' he said. ``It just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Pat Murphy said he was hesitant before the game about
allowing Mills to pitch, but history had suggested that letting the
junior go was the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me said today, `It's going to be a lot to ask. SC
knows him so well,' '' Murphy said. ``But I just know what he's
done for us in the past, so . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mills was pitching on six days of rest. Ultimately, it wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with an 8-4 record this season and a career mark of
27-21.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bittersweet week. On Tuesday, he was the sixth
overall pick in the draft by the Minnesota Twins. He is expected to
receive a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mills said winning a College World Series
``would mean a lot more than getting drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but you're going to have these times in your
life,'' he said. ``It's hard to think about now, but I know I'm
fortunate to have been a part of this. A lot of people can't say
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot to feel good about. We've accomplished a
lot this year. We fought until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills is used to dealing with adversity.
</P>
<P>
   He was hit in the face by a line drive in the first inning of
his first start as a freshman and made only three appearances the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He came back as a sophomore to post a 6-3 mark and 2.88 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He was unable to pitch in the second championship game against
Miami in the Atlantic Regional last season because his arm didn't
have it. It wasn't a decision he wanted to make but felt it was the
best for the team, even though some criticized him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what he's done for us this season,'' ASU Coach
Pat Murphy said. ``He's dealt with a lot. He's a winner, and that's
why I think he's someone who will have success in the future.'' &QL;

DOVE, QUAIL NUMBERS RAISE HUNTERS' HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dove season doesn't open until early September and the Gambel
quail season opens in October, but already I'm getting excited.
</P>
<P>
   A good friend, Curt Rambo of Tonto Basin, called late last week
to report that he's seeing large broods of Gambel chicks following
their parents along the shoreline of Roosevelt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   That's more encouraging than you know, because he has probably
missed seeing a lot of birds because he's catching so many crappie
between peeks. For your information, the crappie are in 10 to 15
feet of water and holding near submerged vegetation, mainly
cockleburs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bountiful year in the desert. A long dry cycle has
been broken by El Nino rains. The rains not only have helped
fishing (although bass fishing hasn't been all that great), but
also provided wildlife with exceptional habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of birds, that abundant plant life provides abundant
seeds and cover and it spawns large numbers of insects that are an
important source of protein.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Engel-Wilson, small game biologist for the Arizona Game and
Fish Department, already has predicted an average or better Gambel
season. Average usually doesn't sound too good, but considering the
drastic decline in birds the past few years, it sounds wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the increased seed supply and stock tanks with
water, native mourning doves also should have a productive year.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean shooting will be that much better. It
might require some hunting for a change.
</P>
<P>
   In dry years, hunters can depend on agricultural areas for good
hunting. Doves flock to areas where there is a dependable supply of
food and water. They concentrate in agricultural areas where
irrigation supplies both.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Smith, migratory bird biologist for the department, said
reproduction probably will increase, but that doesn't mean large
populations when the shooting season begins.
</P>
<P>
   The birds born in April and May often leave the state before the
season and head south. Many of the available birds when the season
begins are part of a summer hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoons can destroy nests and reduce the number of available
birds in particular areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the main thing is that good seed crops and more water allows
the doves to disperse. Doves should be scattered throughout the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   That means hunting them through scouting trips. Find areas with
mourning doves and keep watching them. Learn their flight patterns,
know where they are. Also find late-morning roosting areas.
</P>
<P>
   White-winged doves are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said white-wings are more closely tied to agricultural
areas. They don't scatter into the desert. White-wings begin
migration in August, but there usually are a lot of them around
when the season opens.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans who hunt migratory birds are required to have both a
hunting license and either a Harvest Information Program stamp or
HIP number on their license. This program is used to keep more
accurate records of migratory bird harvests.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps will be available on July 1, as will the numbers.
Both are free. The stamps can be obtained at any Game and Fish
office. For those who can't get to an office, the numbers are
available by calling (800) 938-5263.
</P>
<P>
   There should be considerable interest in those stamps this year
because it appears hunting will be good. &QL;

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; WOMEN WITH MEN: THREE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Ford. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The three male protagonists in these post-macho tales, whether
in Paris, Montana or Chicago, are always with women, even when
they're not. They also share a sense that things aren't working out
as they should, or perhaps once did. In praising this ``superb
volume'' last year in these pages, Michael Gorra said of the
author, ``Nobody now writing looks ... more like an American
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLOOD RITES: ORIGINS AND HISTORY OF THE PASSIONS OF WAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Barbara Ehrenreich. Metropolitan/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author, armed with a Ph.D. in biology and a sweeping range
of historical literature, argues that it isn't self-interest or
immutable aggressive instincts that drive humans to war, but the
primordial trauma of being hunted by animals who might be appeased
with bloody rituals. ``One of today's most original writers has
tackled one of humankind's most intractable subjects,'' Michael
Sherry wrote in the Book Review last year. ``Properly awed by her
subject, she seeks to nudge and provoke readers, not overpower
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MERCY SEAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rilla Askew. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   This ambitious frontier novel, filled with echoes of the Old
Testament, is narrated by a tough 10-year-old girl who becomes the
prime mover in her extended family as it journeys from Kentucky to
the remote Indian Territory of Oklahoma. The author ``artfully lays
bare the sins and promises of a pioneer society,'' James Polk said
in these pages in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MANSION ON THE HILL: DYLAN, YOUNG, GEFFEN, SPRINGSTEEN, AND
THE HEAD-ON COLLISION OF ROCK AND COMMERCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Fred Goodman. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A former editor at Rolling Stone profiles some of
rock-and-roll's most influential musicians and managers, and in the
process tracks the growth of an industry that once aspired to
change the world. The result is ``an excellent chronicle of rock's
sad metamorphosis from a quasi-moral force into an unstoppable
money machine,'' Charles Kaiser said here last year.  &UR; INVISIBLE
REPUBLIC: BOB DYLAN'S BASEMENT TAPES &LR; , by Greil Marcus (Owl/Holt,
$12.95), focuses on a legendary group of more than 100 cowboy
ballads, Appalachian tunes and other folk songs recorded by Dylan
and the Band in 1967. ``No previous writer has so transportingly or
authoritatively revealed ... Dylan against the receding vistas of
American music and culture,'' Robert Polito wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TALKING TO THE DEAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Dunmore. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A London photographer travels to rural Britain to care for her
older sister and her newborn son, a visit that stirs painful
memories of the sisters' infant brother and the increasingly
suspicious circumstances surrounding his death 25 years earlier.
This ``gripping and complex'' story ''metamorphoses from a simple
mystery into a moral whodunit,'' Carol Kino said in the Book Review
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE KISS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Kathryn Harrison. Bard/Avon, $11.
</P>
<P>
   The author tells of her obsessive affair with her father, a
handsome middle-aged preacher who turned up after a long absence to
seduce her when she was a college student. This ``powerful,
disturbing'' memoir is about ``the soul of a young girl and the
terrible injury inflicted by the man who should have been its
protector,'' Susan Cheever wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FUGITIVE PIECES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Michaels. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel by a Canadian poet takes shape in the journal
of a Polish Jew and orphaned Holocaust survivor, whose inner life
is filled with inquiries into the nature of memory, guilt, atrocity
and love. Last year, our reviewer, W.S. Di Piero, admired the
book's ``lyricism and sassy deftness.''  &UR; THE SHADOW CATCHER &LR; , by
Andrzej Szczypiorski, translated by Bill Johnston (Grove, $12),
features another protagonist scarred by Nazi-era Poland. In this
coming-of-age novel, a sensitive 15-year-old boy in Warsaw
gradually senses that his safe, privileged world is crumbling
around him. The author ``revels in smells and textures, bodies and
sounds,'' Piotr Michalowski said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE INHERITANCE: HOW THREE FAMILIES AND THE AMERICAN POLITICAL
MAJORITY MOVED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Samuel G. Freedman. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author charts the rise and fall of the New Deal coalition by
following three blue-collar immigrant families -- one Irish, one
Polish, one Italian -- as they claw their way to respectability by
the third generation. In 1996 our reviewer, James M. McPherson,
called this a ``timely, incisive, and engrossing book.'' The same
publisher has issued another personal account of the nation's
rightward shift,  &UR; RADICAL SON: A GENERATIONAL ODYSSEY &LR; , by David
Horowitz ($15), in which a son of communist parents details his
journey from Marxist radical in the New Left of the '60s to
militant critic of his former associates. This is a ``warmly human
and abrasive'' autobiography, Richard Gid Powers wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STORY OF JUNK &LR;
</P>
<P>

   The narrator, an aspiring writer who deals heroin to pay for her
habit, is surprisingly sharp and upbeat as she plies her trade in
the East Village drug and art scene in the 1980s. Last year in
these pages, Catherine Texier called this first novel ``a
fascinating account ... of life at the edge of one's soul.''

</P>
<P>
   ASIA-ECON (Ban Wan Yai, Thailand) _ In the 11 months since the
economic crisis exploded in Thailand and began spreading through
the region, the most prominent victims have been the humbled
tycoons in the big cities, and they have indeed fallen farthest.
But they are neither the most common victims nor the most
desperate. The worst off are those who were already at the margins
of society _ those who had almost nothing before and who now,
somehow, have even less. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-POMPEII (Pompeii) _ There are two Pompeiis on the bay of
Naples, and it is not always clear which is the dead city. One,
crawling with tourists, guides, workmen, and archeologists, hums
with expectant activity. The other, where the unemployment rate is
30 percent, boasts crumbling buildings, faded hontytonk signs, old
people, and stray dogs sleeping in the sun. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Tropoje, Albania) _ The rebels who escort
refugees across the border into Albania boast proudly that they are
holding a stretch of road near Pec against Serbian soldiers. But
none are able to explain how dying for this piece of asphalt
advances the rebel cause. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-VOTE (Dateline TK) _ Swiss voters, in a referendum, reject
a ban on genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-LABOR (Mexico City) _ Alejandra Barrales, the insurgent
leader of Mexico's 2,000-strong stewardess union, is leading the
first nationwide strike by the country's major new independent
labor federation.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-ENVIRON (Sandton) _ There's something different about
environmentalism in South Africa. While American and European
children get environmental educations that turn them into
tree-huggers who believe every sapling is special, South Africans
get a different perspective. The environment here is under threat
not so much from the smokestacks, but from ``exotics'' _ aliens
from afar bent on stealing the nation's water and driving out its
native vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   ELDERLY-CARE (Philadelphia) _ As Americans continue to live
longer than ever, growing numbers of elderly people and their
families are being caught in the gap between the cost of long-term
care, necessities ranging from private aides to diapers, and the
limited amount of government aid to pay for it. And as the baby
boomers age over the next 30 years and the over-85 population grows
particularly fast, the need for such care will only escalate,
experts say. By Sara Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   RELIG-POLITICS (Atlanta) _ With the Republican primary season in
full bloom, Ralph Reed and his new consulting firm sit atop the
fault line between the pragmatists and the purists within America's
religious right. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-LAWYERS (Undated) _ Lawyers who fought the tobacco
industry have found a new focus for their energies: fighting for
their share of the spoils from lawsuits against the industry. The
issue of the lawyers' fees has become intensely controversial in
states that have settled lawsuits against cigarette makers as well
as in Congress, which is considering federal tobacco legislation.
At stake is the richest pot of fees in the legal history.
</P>
<P>
   MILK-WARS (Stockbridge, Mass.) _ A dispute over dairy pricing
has pitted farmers in Western Massachusetts versus those in upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BIRD-CALLERS (Piedmont, Calif.) _ For decades, the claim
to fame of Piedmont, an affluent community of about 11,500
residents nestled next to Oakland, had been the high school's
annual bird-calling contest, in which the college-destined sons of
physicians and daughters of lawyers took a frivolous pause from
more relevant endeavors to imitate the calls of the wild. By Frank
Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   POWELL-POLITICS (Tampa, Fla.) _ After some early stumbles and
miscalculations, including three different chief executives, the
volunteerism campaign dubbed America's Promise and led by Gen.
Colin Powell has lately begun to build momentum, with a register of
impressive commitments from big corporations and an outpouring of
workaday people willing to roll up their sleeves for good causes.
By Kirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CLERGY-CHINA (Undated) _ A broad array of religious
leaders is urging Clinton to use his summit meeting later this
month in Beijing to press the Chinese government to end the
repression of religious believers there.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-ANTISMOKE (San Francisco) _ The California Public Health
Department has unveiled its latest anti-smoking ad: a guy with a
limp cigarette in his mouth. The message: cigarettes raise
impotency rates. It's an interesting approach in the Viagra era,
but it's also a window into the endless creativity and effort that
this state, perhaps more than any other, pours into the
anti-smoking crusade.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Heroes PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A comic version of Lewis and Clark, with Matthew Perry and the
late Chris Farley as mismatched 19th-century explorers. Novel and
giddily silly at first, but simply dopey by the end. Rated PG-13
for brief nudity, strong language and comic violence. 1 hour, 29
minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this slow-moving but
beautifully observed character study about a Pentecostal preacher
who finds, late in the game, that being a holy man and being a good
one aren't always the same thing. The acting is uniformly strong,
with Britain's Miranda Richardson disappearing entirely in the role
of a smalltown Louisiana woman and Farrah Fawcett doing just fine
as the preacher's trophy wife. And Duvall's performance is a small
miracle. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and a scene of violence.
2 hours, 10 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist Hunter
S. Thompson and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's version of
Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to Vegas has a
brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But Johnny Depp
gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as Thompson. Rated R
for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug use. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick's is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   I Think I Do NR
</P>
<P>
   I think you'd rather not. A failed attempt to give a clever gay
twist to a combo of screwball farce and ``Big Chill'' reunion
movie, the film is a charmless comedy in which old college pals
re-convene at a wedding and work out old crushes...and new. Stars
Alexis Arquette. Not rated but there's vulgar language and sexual
situations (especially gay couplings). 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER)
Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Rising R
</P>
<P>
   A gray, tired and joyless Bruce Willis vehicle that makes ``The
Jackal'' look like a classic. This one casts Willis as Art, an
undercover FBI agent who has to protect a 9-year-old named Simon
(Miko Hughes) from killers. Simon is an autistic boy who
accidentally cracks a security code devised by the shadowy,
all-powerful National Security Agency. Alec Baldwin, in his
too-familiar sinister mode, plays an NSA honcho who orders the kid
rubbed out. Rated R for violence. 1 hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade:
D+
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan is back and better than ever in this
action-intensive delight about a TV chef (Chan) accidentally caught
between rival gangs looking for an incriminating tape. The star is
Buster Keaton, Baryshnikov and Bruce Lee, all rolled into one. He's
the real thing and the things he does will leave you reeling. Go
see for yourself. Rated PG-13 for violence and one curse word. 1
hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Object of My Affection R
</P>
<P>
   Based on Stephen McCauley's novel, this comedy-drama is
fashioned as sort of a modern-day Shakespearean romp of romantic
mismatches. Nina (Jennifer Aniston) gets pregnant by her bossy
lover (John Pankow). She begins to think her new roommate George
(Paul Rudd) would make a better father _ he's polite, single, smart
and a babe. He's also gay. Shimmering with charm and sharp
performances, the movie can't quite overcome a central problem.
George and Nina are such bland, nice nudniks, it's hard to invest
in their story. Rated R for strong language and some sexuality. 1
hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Players Club R
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut as a writer and director,
steals readily from Spike Lee's 1996 flick ``Girl 6.'' And that's
the best thing he does here. Cube's movie about a strip club
masquerades as the story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly
struggles to pay her college tuition and feed her young son by
performing at night. Instead we get a cliched view of woman, two
rapes and a catfight between the mother and another dancer. It's
prurient ``ho''-some entertainment. Don't get played by it. Rated R
for strong language, sexual content and violence. 1 hour, 43
minutes. (SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Post Coitum NR
</P>
<P>
   Doomed passion is charted unsparingly in this French film from
Brigitte Rouan. A chic forty-ish woman (Rouan) risks her family and
her career for a heedless affair with a younger man. A raw,
revealing tragicomedy that offers truths as inescapable as stretch
marks. Not Rated but there are steamy sex scenes. In French with
subtitles. 1 hour, 37 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Primary Colors R
</P>
<P>
   Color it a knock-out. Mike Nichols, who gave a generation a
code-word (``plastics'') now delivers its elegy with this savvy
film about a presidential hopeful and his wife who resemble certain
White House inhabitants. The movie moves from satire to something
far deeper almost effortlessly. The terrific cast is headed by John
Travolta (all gut and twinkle), Emma Thompson, and Kathy Bates. As
Pogo once said, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.'' Rated R for
language and adult situations. 2 hours, 14 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Scream 2 R
</P>
<P>
   Still a scream _ in both the scary and the funny sense. Writer
Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven, the team that made
``Scream'' the unexpected hit of 1996, takes scary sequels as their
target this time around. Neve Campbell returns as our beleaguered
heroine Sidney, now enrolled in picturesque Windsor College (it's
actually Decatur's Agnes Scott), where a masked killer is prowling
around with a butcher knife. ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the
bracing experience of the first film. But it gets as close as you
could hope for. Rated R for language and violence. 2 hours. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Senseless R
</P>
<P>
   Score one for truth in advertising. In this sloppy, crude and
yes, senseless, comedy, Marlon Wayans plays a struggling college
student who enrolls in an experimental drug program to score some
quick cash. The drugs give him supersensory powers, but an overdose
has the opposite result. The movie's offensiveness _ it frequently
stoops to bathroom humor _ would be tolerable were it made with
flair. But director Penelope Spheeris, who brought a dash of
panache to ``Wayne's World,'' is in hack-for-hire mode here. 1
hour, 37 minutes. (DH) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Titanic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The ship goes down, but the movie stays afloat. Writer-director
James Cameron harnesses Hollywood's latest high-tech tricks to tell
an old-fashioned romance for the gals that doesn't neglect the
guys, either. Kate Winslet plays an upper-crust Philadelphia girl
returning from Europe on the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio is a
scrappy artist who has admired her from afar. Rated PG-13 for
disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality and brief
language. 3 hours, 14 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly-executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Two Girls and a Guy R
</P>
<P>
   A nauseating and unconvincing movie. Two young women (Heather
Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) discover they've been dating the
same guy (Robert Downey Jr.). During the ensuing accusations,
trumped-up confrontations, etc., Downey's character says, ``This
isn't going very well.'' Understatement of the year. Rated R for
sex, language and nudity. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER) Grade: F
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2

<P>
   The Wedding Singer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A sweet 'n' silly love song of a movie. It's 1985. Adam Sandler
is the titular matrimonial entertainer. Drew Barrymore is a
sweetheart of a waitress. They're clearly Meant For Each Other, but
otherwise engaged. The pre-teen boys who rented ``Happy Gilmore''
by the billions may not be entranced, but the date crowd will
appreciate the shrewd blend of '80s jokes (Deloreans? Billy Idol?)
and romance lite. Rated PG-13 for mild sexual situations and vulgar
language. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Woo R
</P>
<P>
   An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to find true love
amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is the title
character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy behavior of
guys, she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy Davidson) with
the determination to prove his innate canine drive. Rated R for
language, sex and marijuana smoking. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (SM)

</P>
<P>
   Almost Heroes PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A comic version of Lewis and Clark, with Matthew Perry and the
late Chris Farley as mismatched 19th-century explorers. Novel and
giddily silly at first, but simply dopey by the end. Rated PG-13
for brief nudity, strong language and comic violence. 1 hour, 29
minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this slow-moving but
beautifully observed character study about a Pentecostal preacher
who finds, late in the game, that being a holy man and being a good
one aren't always the same thing. The acting is uniformly strong,
with Britain's Miranda Richardson disappearing entirely in the role
of a smalltown Louisiana woman and Farrah Fawcett doing just fine
as the preacher's trophy wife. And Duvall's performance is a small
miracle. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and a scene of violence.
2 hours, 10 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist Hunter
S. Thompson and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's version of
Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to Vegas has a
brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But Johnny Depp
gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as Thompson. Rated R
for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug use. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick's is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   I Think I Do NR
</P>
<P>
   I think you'd rather not. A failed attempt to give a clever gay
twist to a combo of screwball farce and ``Big Chill'' reunion
movie, the film is a charmless comedy in which old college pals
re-convene at a wedding and work out old crushes...and new. Stars
Alexis Arquette. Not rated but there's vulgar language and sexual
situations (especially gay couplings). 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER)
Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Rising R
</P>
<P>
   A gray, tired and joyless Bruce Willis vehicle that makes ``The
Jackal'' look like a classic. This one casts Willis as Art, an
undercover FBI agent who has to protect a 9-year-old named Simon
(Miko Hughes) from killers. Simon is an autistic boy who
accidentally cracks a security code devised by the shadowy,
all-powerful National Security Agency. Alec Baldwin, in his
too-familiar sinister mode, plays an NSA honcho who orders the kid
rubbed out. Rated R for violence. 1 hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade:
D+
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan is back and better than ever in this
action-intensive delight about a TV chef (Chan) accidentally caught
between rival gangs looking for an incriminating tape. The star is
Buster Keaton, Baryshnikov and Bruce Lee, all rolled into one. He's
the real thing and the things he does will leave you reeling. Go
see for yourself. Rated PG-13 for violence and one curse word. 1
hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Object of My Affection R
</P>
<P>
   Based on Stephen McCauley's novel, this comedy-drama is
fashioned as sort of a modern-day Shakespearean romp of romantic
mismatches. Nina (Jennifer Aniston) gets pregnant by her bossy
lover (John Pankow). She begins to think her new roommate George
(Paul Rudd) would make a better father _ he's polite, single, smart
and a babe. He's also gay. Shimmering with charm and sharp
performances, the movie can't quite overcome a central problem.
George and Nina are such bland, nice nudniks, it's hard to invest
in their story. Rated R for strong language and some sexuality. 1
hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Players Club R
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut as a writer and director,
steals readily from Spike Lee's 1996 flick ``Girl 6.'' And that's
the best thing he does here. Cube's movie about a strip club
masquerades as the story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly
struggles to pay her college tuition and feed her young son by
performing at night. Instead we get a cliched view of woman, two
rapes and a catfight between the mother and another dancer. It's
prurient ``ho''-some entertainment. Don't get played by it. Rated R
for strong language, sexual content and violence. 1 hour, 43
minutes. (SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Post Coitum NR
</P>
<P>
   Doomed passion is charted unsparingly in this French film from
Brigitte Rouan. A chic forty-ish woman (Rouan) risks her family and
her career for a heedless affair with a younger man. A raw,
revealing tragicomedy that offers truths as inescapable as stretch
marks. Not Rated but there are steamy sex scenes. In French with
subtitles. 1 hour, 37 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Primary Colors R
</P>
<P>
   Color it a knock-out. Mike Nichols, who gave a generation a
code-word (``plastics'') now delivers its elegy with this savvy
film about a presidential hopeful and his wife who resemble certain
White House inhabitants. The movie moves from satire to something
far deeper almost effortlessly. The terrific cast is headed by John
Travolta (all gut and twinkle), Emma Thompson, and Kathy Bates. As
Pogo once said, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.'' Rated R for
language and adult situations. 2 hours, 14 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Scream 2 R
</P>
<P>
   Still a scream _ in both the scary and the funny sense. Writer
Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven, the team that made
``Scream'' the unexpected hit of 1996, takes scary sequels as their
target this time around. Neve Campbell returns as our beleaguered
heroine Sidney, now enrolled in picturesque Windsor College (it's
actually Decatur's Agnes Scott), where a masked killer is prowling
around with a butcher knife. ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the
bracing experience of the first film. But it gets as close as you
could hope for. Rated R for language and violence. 2 hours. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Senseless R
</P>
<P>
   Score one for truth in advertising. In this sloppy, crude and
yes, senseless, comedy, Marlon Wayans plays a struggling college
student who enrolls in an experimental drug program to score some
quick cash. The drugs give him supersensory powers, but an overdose
has the opposite result. The movie's offensiveness _ it frequently
stoops to bathroom humor _ would be tolerable were it made with
flair. But director Penelope Spheeris, who brought a dash of
panache to ``Wayne's World,'' is in hack-for-hire mode here. 1
hour, 37 minutes. (DH) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Titanic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The ship goes down, but the movie stays afloat. Writer-director
James Cameron harnesses Hollywood's latest high-tech tricks to tell
an old-fashioned romance for the gals that doesn't neglect the
guys, either. Kate Winslet plays an upper-crust Philadelphia girl
returning from Europe on the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio is a
scrappy artist who has admired her from afar. Rated PG-13 for
disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality and brief
language. 3 hours, 14 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly-executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Two Girls and a Guy R
</P>
<P>
   A nauseating and unconvincing movie. Two young women (Heather
Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) discover they've been dating the
same guy (Robert Downey Jr.). During the ensuing accusations,
trumped-up confrontations, etc., Downey's character says, ``This
isn't going very well.'' Understatement of the year. Rated R for
sex, language and nudity. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER) Grade: F
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Wedding Singer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A sweet 'n' silly love song of a movie. It's 1985. Adam Sandler
is the titular matrimonial entertainer. Drew Barrymore is a
sweetheart of a waitress. They're clearly Meant For Each Other, but
otherwise engaged. The pre-teen boys who rented ``Happy Gilmore''
by the billions may not be entranced, but the date crowd will

and romance lite. Rated PG-13 for mild sexual situations and vulgar
language. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER) Grade: B

with people living longer and worrying more about running out of

life insurance or buying less. Instead, they are pouring money into

management of the Internet itself _ over to an as-yet-unformed
private corporation, representing various Internet interests. By

   CISCO-COMPETE (Undated) _ For most of the past decade, Cisco
Systems Inc. has been steamrolling competitors in data networking.
Its routers and switches dominate the Internet and corporate
networks that try to get disparate sorts of computers to talk to
each other. But lately, Cisco is on a collision course with a set
of new, much bigger competitors. A look at how Lucent and Nortel
are angling for Cisco's network equipment business.

<P>
   PRISON-HEALTHCARE (Undated) _ With the ranks of prisoners rising
an average of 8 percent every year, prison health care is an
expensive proposition. To control costs and enhance security, a
handful of states are trying out telemedicine -- healthcare via
telecommunications. With government agencies, managed care
providers, and legislators watching, these programs are serving as
proving grounds for bringing telemedicine to the broader
population.

   TV-NEWSVIEWERS-MEDIA (Undated) _ Following a pattern seen in
entertainment viewing, Americans now watch news programs on cable
television networks about as regularly as those on broadcast
networks, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press. The researchers also found that the number of
people who get their news from the Internet is rising rapidly, and
estimated that almost as many people use the Internet on a typical
weekday as spend time reading a magazine. By Lawrie Mifflin.

TELEVISION STATIONS REMAIN SPLIT ON COVERAGE OF LIVE EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Live television coverage of a man's suicide on a
freeway prompted outrage among viewers here in April. It also led
to an open discussion about whether it was time to rethink
standards and practices in news. KNBC received 2,000 complaints,
and called each of those viewers back to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   But a second incident quickly followed the first. On May 26, a
driver being pursued by police _ identified later as a 25-year-old
Los Angeles police officer reportedly distraught over a
relationship _ intentionally gunned her Chevrolet Suburban at a
freeway piling, killing herself on impact.
</P>
<P>
   The way the story was handled illustrates how various stations
are dealing with such incidents. Only one station _ KCBS-TV _
carried the event live, though KTLA and UPN showed tape of it
during their newscasts. KNBC did neither. Other stations did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the April suicide, which occurred during ratings
``sweeps,'' several stations said they had become more cautious
about covering police chases. Jeff Wald, the news director at KTLA,
said his station is installing a device that will provide a
10-second delay between an event and its live broadcast. KNBC is
considering doing the same, and has installed a ``kill'' switch in
its helicopter so the pilot can cut away from a live broadcast
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen, news director at UPN, and Larry Perret, news
director at KCBS, said the need to be vigilant during broadcasts of
police chases was reiterated, but no policies were revised. (Of the
recent incident, Perret said: ``It's news. So we carried the
news.'') And an effort by the Radio-Television News Directors
Association to gather Los Angeles television news officials to
discuss standards failed when no one expressed interest in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think each news department and news management should make
their decisions of what they want to cover, how and when,'' Cohen
said. ``I'm not interested in having a consortium recommend to me
what we should or shouldn't do.''

CNN HOPES FOR SYNERGY IN ITS `NEWSSTAND' SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to know what came first _ the idea of partnerships
between Time-Warner's weekly magazines and Turner Broadcasting's
all-news network CNN, or the idea of changing CNN's humdrum
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But when Time Warner Inc. and Turner merged in the fall of 1996,
both ideas began to percolate. And they really picked up steam a
year later, after CNN's chief executive, Tom Johnson, lured Richard
Kaplan away from ABC News to become president of CNN/U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said he wanted to transform people's perceptions of CNN
as essentially all-news radio with pictures. To give the network
more depth and authoritative swagger, he decided CNN had to have
some ``must see'' shows in prime time, in addition to ``Larry King
Live,'' the network's highest-rated show.
</P>
<P>
   As a business proposition, too, Kaplan wanted to find a way to
hold onto those 1 million or so viewers who tune in to King's talk
show at 9 each weeknight _ most of whom tune elsewhere immediately
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting brainstorm made its debut Sunday night. ``CNN
Newsstand,'' a series of 10 p.m. news magazine shows, will mix the
expertise of some Time Inc. print magazines with CNN's television
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsstand: CNN and Time,'' anchored by Jeff Greenfield and
Bernard Shaw, will appear Sunday nights and be repeated Mondays;
Wednesday will bring ``Newsstand: CNN and Fortune,'' anchored by
Willow Bay and Stephen Frazier, and Thursday, ``Newsstand: CNN and
Entertainment Weekly,'' anchored by Ms. Bay and Judd Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's overall ambition, he said in an interview last week, is
to make CNN ``the default network'' for news aficionados, ``the
place they go first when they turn on the TV set.''
</P>
<P>
   That is already the case ``when there's a war or a crisis or a
calamity,'' he added. ``But when news isn't hot, we still want to
be the place news viewers go first. We want to have really smart,
news-oriented programming that people will make an appointment to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``appointment viewing'' has become a mantra for
programmers seeking to stand out in a world of 60 or 70 channels
and thousands of shows. But for serious news viewers, how many
appointments can be kept?
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. alone, NBC's ``Dateline'' appears two nights a week,
ABC's ``20/20'' appears two nights, and CBS's ``48 Hours'' appears
once _ not to mention the 10 o'clock dramas that a serious viewer
might consider appointment viewing, like ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The
Practice,'' ``ER'' or ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Sundays, when ``Newsstand: CNN and Time'' appears at 10
p.m., it will follow three other news magazines _ ``60 Minutes''
(CBS at 7), ``Dateline'' (NBC at 8) and ``20/20'' (ABC at 9).
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives believe this is where synergy will make a
difference. They think news-followers will be attracted by the
familiar names and reputations of magazines like Time, Fortune, and
Entertainment Weekly. ``It's a lot easier to get a show's mission
conveyed to viewers when you're associated with a well-known
magazine like Time,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Each show will have some stories developed by the magazine's
journalists and some by CNN's journalists. Eventually, Kaplan hopes
to have ``Newsstand'' programs seven nights a week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Rick comes from long form,'' said Roger Ailes, chairman of Fox
News Channel which, with MSNBC, is one of CNN's two rival 24-hour
news networks. ``He's a very talented long-form producer, so it's
natural for him to try to salvage a boring presentation of news
with special `appointment' shows.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN needs invigoration; its ratings have been stagnant, and in a
survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press,
being released Monday, only 23 percent of Americans surveyed in May
1998 said they watched CNN ``regularly,'' compared with 35 percent
in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the news shows represented the most important and
most ambitious new steps taken by CNN since the creation of ``Larry
King Live'' in 1985 and ``Crossfire,'' an issue-and-debate program,
in 1982. Hiring Kaplan, he said, was ``by far the most important
decision I've made in my seven and a half years here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who spent 17 years at ABC News, had helped re-invigorate
the ``Nightline'' program when he was its executive producer, from
1984 to 1989, and had created the ABC news magazine ``PrimeTime
Live'' after that. Johnson said he wanted CNN to have the same kind
of leadership _ innovative without being gimmicky or trendy.

ANALYSIS: PUNTING AN INTERNET HOT POTATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration called it ``A Proposal to Improve the
Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report released on Friday by the Commerce Department was
much more than that. It had been long awaited by the Internet
community _ which these days means everyone from multinational
corporations to sandals-and-socks computer programmers to
grandmothers on America Online _ as the government's first real
attempt to specify a system of governance for the informally
organized global computer network born in federal laboratories
nearly three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year of intense study, peering into issues of
technology, trademark law, international politics, and competition,
the government turned to the Internet community and said: Here, you
do it.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it had decided to turn the management of
Internet domain names _ and thus the management of the Internet
itself _ over to an as-yet-unformed private corporation,
representing various Internet interests. That organization will be
responsible for fixing the escalating problem of assigning Internet
domain names _ the chaotic scramble for coveted cyberspace
addresses that was the impetus for the review in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Domain names and addresses are the computer network equivalent
of phone numbers, street addresses and trademarks, all rolled in
one. Each of the millions of computers connected to the Internet
requires a unique address, which enables electronic mail to get to
its intended destination and World Wide Web pages to be found in
what is rapidly becoming the world's main library. Each computer's
formal address is expressed as a series of numbers, for example,
166.84.0.209. But to make the addresses easier to use, companies
and individuals can ask to assign a name to the numbers, like
panix.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ``.com'' part of the address is called a top-level domain,
and it is roughly the equivalent of a telephone area code. The
current top-level domain system _ seven generic top-level domains
like .com and .org and .edu, plus a couple hundred two-letter
country codes _ was created when there were just a few hundred
computers connected to the Net. Nobody anticipated the phenomenal
growth of the Internet as a global network used by millions for
electronic commerce, communications and entertainment. Today, the
domain set aside for commercial activity _ .com _ is the largest
and fastest growing.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 new commercial domain-name registrations
being added each month, the Internet is headed toward a traffic jam
that makes the overcrowding of phone area codes look benign.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to fix the problem by adding more top-level
domains, which it proposed doing in an earlier, much-criticized
draft of the report, the administration called for creation of a
private not-for-profit international corporation whose job it would
be to find a solution to the domain-name problem. If all went
according to plan, the new corporation would assemble an
international board of 15 directors from the private sector (the
report did not even specify how the board would be chosen, leaving
even that matter to the Internet community) and would begin
tackling the most fundamental questions about the future of the
global network by October.
</P>
<P>
   People hoping for more immediate action were left unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were going to do that, they could have done it a year
ago,'' said Carl Oppedahl, a patent and trademark lawyer in
Colorado, who has been a critic of the current system, which has no
formal structure for resolving domain-name trademark disputes. ``I
feel badly about the time delay. The Internet has not benefited
from having all these months go by.''
</P>
<P>
   The government reserved the right to overrule whatever choices
the private sector makes. And, while repeatedly professing its
desire to get out of the Internet oversight business, the
government left open the possibility that it might retain that
option until well into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The government's proposal was bad news for those looking for
relief from domain congestion or seeking some improvement of the
current trademark dispute morass, and for dozens of domain name
registry businesses that had hoped to become rich selling names in
proposed new domains like .web, .inc, or .sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's network solution was good news for Network
Solutions Inc., the Virginia company that five years ago was
awarded an exclusive government contract to administer the .com,
.org and .net domains. When Network Solutions got the contract,
there was no fee to register names. Soon after, it got permission
to begin charging $50 for each name (recently reduced to $35).
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions' contract is supposed to expire on Sept. 30,
but the new report opens the possibility that the company will
continue to have a monopoly on the lucrative ``.com'' franchise
until the new corporation comes up with an alternative _ something
that everyone agrees will be no easy task. As a result, Network
Solutions' stock soared on Friday, up $6.75, to $39.25.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Viewed one way, the administration's decision to not make any
decisions was a vote of support for the Internet's old guard, which
has long argued that the Internet is capable of regulating itself
without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to read it as a victory for self-governance, a victory
for the Internet and a demonstration that the government has
developed a profound understanding of the way the Internet works,''
said Don Heath, president of the Internet Society, a trade
association.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed another way, the government looked at all the hulking
issues now pressing in on the Internet and punted. Critics say that
by essentially freezing the domain-name situation in its current
form for an indeterminate time, the problems facing the new board
will be even tougher when it convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Time was rarely a concern as the Internet grew organically from
its origins in the 1960s and 1970s. Keeping track of all the new
computers on the network, and all of the technical issues of the
emerging medium, was largely a volunteer effort. But in the early
1990s, when restrictions against commercial uses of the Internet
were relaxed, the environment changed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, millions of companies are investing billions of dollars
in Internet-related ventures. Millions of e-mail messages cross the
network every day, and it is rapidly becoming a conduit for much of
the world's telephone calls. Universities, grade school students,
farmers, scientists, lonely singles, traveling salesmen, busy
families, small businesses and giant corporations have come to
depend on it.
</P>
<P>
   Husbands and wives battle over domain names in divorce court,
companies pay six-figure amounts for rights to ``business.com'' and
``internet.com'' and million-dollar legal fees are increasingly
common in domain-name trademark disputes.
</P>
<P>
   With such large issues at stake, many people want a more defined
structure for the Internet _ not just an ad hoc group of
volunteers, albeit very diligent ones, running the show, as is
currently the case.
</P>
<P>
   The domain name issue is just one of many decisions that need to
be made quickly. Others include: Who is responsible for making
decisions? What parts of the structure are best left to the
marketplace, and what parts are best left to government interests?
In the latter case, whose government? Trademark law is based on
geography, while the Internet is the antithesis of geography. How
to reconcile?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the questions that the Clinton administration
expects a new, unformed, untested, international corporation of
indeterminate composition to answer as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is going to have to be accelerated because the
demand for domain names is astronomical,'' said Ken Stubbs,
chairman of the executive council of CORE, the Council of
Registrars, a group of more than 80 companies that handle
domain-name registrations for businesses and individuals worldwide
_and that all must funnel registrations to Network Solutions. ``If
domain names were ``800'' numbers or cell phone numbers, and
someone announced that there would be no more phone numbers issued
for 12 to 18 months, there would be concern.''

ANALYSTS DIVIDED ON FUTURE OF BATTERED SEMICONDUCTOR STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When bad things happen to good companies, many investors start
looking for buying opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with semiconductor stocks, which have been
battered this year as one formerly stellar company after another
has reported earnings disappointments, layoffs and product delays.
Chip industry analysts agree that the group may be reaching a
bottom, but they differ on when to start buying chip stocks again.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the bad news just keeps on coming. Intel Corp. is
expected to be served with an antitrust suit Monday by the Federal
Trade Commission; late last month the company announced that its
Merced chip would be delayed. Motorola announced last week that it
would cut 15,000 jobs, citing weak demand for cellular phones,
pagers and other products using its semiconductors. And National
Semiconductor warned that revenue would fall below analysts'
estimates, and that it expected to report a loss for its fiscal
fourth quarter, ending May 31, and possibly for the first quarter
of the new year as well.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies face problems of their own making, like
Motorola missing the shift from analog to digital cellular phones,
there are two bigger forces depressing the group as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   First is a glut of personal computers being sold in the United
States, created largely by Compaq Computer Corp.'s need to reduce
inventory as it moves to a build-to-order business model.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the financial and economic crisis in Asia, which has
weakened demand both for personal computers and for all kinds of
devices that use chips.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one in the industry saw either the glut of PCs or the
Asian trouble coming, chip makers kept building production well
into 1997. With supply exceeding demand, prices have plummeted for
semiconductor products from microprocessors to memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer oversupply and the Asia crisis are
presumably temporary, but deciding whether and when to invest in
chip stocks is difficult without a clearer end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that chip
makers had already cut back substantially on new production,
particularly in Asia, and that the PC inventory problems were well
past the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will actually see the demand rate for semiconductors
bounce back,'' he said. ``I think that will begin to happen in the
next 60 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many semiconductor stocks are trading at or near their
52-week lows, Edelstone said, because the companies' first-quarter
earnings were a ``disaster, with two-thirds of companies below
estimates,'' and their financial performances are likely to be the
same in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got stocks that are pretty beaten up, and from a
long-term point of view, attractive at current valuations,'' he
said. ``Investors should be getting their shopping lists
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone is currently recommending Neomagic, a maker of
graphics-control chips for notebook computers; Rambus, a maker of
fast memory devices; Xilinx Inc., a maker of programmable logic
devices, and Intel, which he believes will be little affected by
the FTC suit or the Merced delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect them to be strong in the second half,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., said that it was too
early to begin buying most chip stocks _ that Asia remained an
open-ended situation and that the oversupply of PCs was still a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very easy to say it's got to get better pretty
soon, but so far the data that would support such a conclusion are
scarce,'' he said. ``I believe it will happen, but that's only
blind faith. Having said all that, I think we're going to get a
rash of pre-announcements like Motorola's, if not as big, over the
next few weeks. At that point most of the bad news will be
discounted, and even if it takes a year to get a recovery, most of
the risk will be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Peck said he recommended some chip stocks that he
thought had been unfairly battered. Among them, he likes Analog
Devices, which makes chips for processing graphics, sound and other
nondigital signals, and Amcor, which makes semiconductor packaging
material. For the bulk of the semiconductor stocks, Peck said the
time to buy had not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, by the time it becomes apparent that the worst
is over, prices will most likely have gone up. Michael Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said he started
buying chip stocks last week. ``I think we're going to go into a
pretty different environment in the second half of the year, where
prices will firm up,'' he said. ``We started buying Intel when it
went below $75 and took it to 5 percent of our portfolio when it
went below $70.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is also recommending LSI Logic, Integrated Device
Technology, Altera, Atmel and Xilinx. ``I think you can pretty much
buy anything in the semiconductor area,'' he said.

   ASIA-ECON (Ban Wan Yai, Thailand) _ In the 11 months since the

tycoons in the big cities, and they have fallen farthest. But they

with people living longer and worrying more about running out of
money in retirement, millions of Americans are either doing without
life insurance or buying less. Instead, they are pouring money into

WHEN SCRABBLE MEETS MAH-JONGG  
 A BOX TO KEEP WATCHES WOUND   
 SNAP-OPEN FRAMES FOR EYEGLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    This is the 50th anniversary of Scrabble, the classic spelling
game thought up by Alfred Butts, an unemployed architect, as he sat
in his fifth-floor walk-up apartment in Queens one night.
 &HT;    Is it possible that Butts' game can be improved? Pingsheng
Huang, an inventor in Towaco, N.J., thinks so.
 &HT;    Huang has patented a new type of word game that he describes as
a cross between Scrabble and the ancient Chinese game of mah-jongg.
 &HT;    His game, which he calls Magi Compo, uses 144 tiles, as does
mah-jongg. But mah-jongg tiles feature abstract symbols that have
to be matched up. Huang's tiles _ like those in Scrabble _ are
inscribed with English letters that are arranged to make up words.
 &HT;    But Huang's tiles are far more complex than those in Scrabble.
Each tile has not just a single letter, but also letter
combinations. A player can pick which combination of letters he
wishes to use. For example, he might draw a tile that has ``P,''
``PE'' and ``PER'' inscribed on it, and then draw a second tile
that has ``A,'' ``AL'' and ``AR.'' From these two tiles, he could
choose to form the words ``pear'' or ``pal'' or ``par'' or ``peal.`
 &HT;    The scoring system is also different, said Huang. In Scrabble,
players reap big points by using letters like ``x'' or ``q.'' With
Magi Compo, the longer the word, the bigger the score, with no
weight given to less-common letters or letter combinations. Huang
also includes a number of wild-card tiles that can be designated
whatever letter a player wishes.
 &HT;    Earlier this year, Huang, who is originally from China but has
lived in the United States since 1990, quit his job as a marketing
director for a computer company so he could promote his invention
full time. Last month, he visited China to line up a manufacturer
for the game, which he thinks will retail for about $50.
 &HT;    So far, though, Huang has not found an outlet to sell his game.
For inspiration, he might look to the story of Butts. Scrabble did
not come on the market until 1948 _ 10 years after Butts patented
it.
 &HT;    Huang received patent 5,556,102.

   Although battery-powered watches are the norm these days,
mechanical watches remain popular among timepiece connoisseurs.
Many of these are self-winding as the wearer moves his or her
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the watch is not worn for a few days? ``Once
it stops, it can be a pain to reset it,'' said Jeff Richards, an
inventor in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Richards has patented a battery-operated vibrating jewelry box
that will keep a watch ticking. ``The patent is on the motion
itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the jewelry box would sell for $250 to $350 but
that he hoped to persuade a watchmaker to give away the box with
high-end watches. ``That's reasonable if someone were to buy a
$10,000 watch,'' he said.
</P>

   Richards received patent 5,608,693.

   David Wedeck, a former television executive in Teaneck, N.J.,
has patented what he says is an inexpensive way to make a fashion
statement with eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   His eyeglasses snap open at the point where the temple meets the
lens frame so that the same lenses can be used in several different
frames. The interchangeable frames can be either plastic or metal,
Wedeck said, and take less than a minute to snap out and put in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inexpensive way to get yourself a variety of styles
and colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wedeck, who said he would like to license his invention,
received patent 5,760,866.

`INVASION AMERICA': FATHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET _ REALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're going to find out that your father was a space alien,
it's nice at least to learn that he was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Invasion America,'' the WB network's new animated dramatic
miniseries from Dreamworks, David Carter (with the voice of Mikey
Kelley), a typical Glenport, Mass., high school student, makes that
very discovery. When David feels ``I am different, and I don't know
why,'' his mother (Kath Soucie) tells him that all teen-agers feel
that way.
</P>
<P>
   What she hasn't mentioned, until now, is that 17 years ago in
Utah she saw a spaceship land and, being a brave Linda Hamilton
type (as in ``Terminator 2''), introduced herself to some nice
Tyrusians and was soon hopping into her four-wheel-drive vehicle to
help them outrun explosions, helicopters, fire and huge beasts
called Manglers.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, she and Cael (Lorenzo Lamas), king of the
aliens, have a baby and a house in the country. But when that
child, David, is a toddler, Cael has to return to the planet Tyrus
to fight the bad Tyrusians who want to invade and conquer Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Glenport, it turns out that the local sheriff, Rafe _
yes, Rafe (Edward Albert) _ who has always been a father figure for
David, is an alien, too. So are a few thousand other seemingly
human people. Other famous voices in the cast include those of
Leonard Nimoy, Robert Urich, Dee Wallace Stone and Kristy McNichol.
</P>
<P>
   The animation in ``Invasion America'' is impressive, especially
the outer-space scenes, and stylish to the point of art deco. But
there's no heart in it; the animators' last priority seems to have
been giving the characters' faces believable emotion, even during
all that yelling and running.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Invasion America'' wins and keeps viewers, it will be
because it fits a fantasy almost every adolescent has had: This
can't be my real life. These can't be my real parents. I'm really a
prince or princess, somehow separated from my castle and the life I
deserve.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that's exactly David Carter's situation, as he
learns when he puts on a glowing white glove that immediately
adjusts to fit his hand and gives him telekinetic powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invasion America'' is a miniseries in the original meaning of
the term. After a two-part premiere, on Monday and Tuesday, it will
appear on Tuesdays for five weeks, including a 90-minute finale on
July 7. Chances are, Earth will be saved.

PROBLEMS ABOUND AS TELEVISION INDUSTRY MOVES TO DIGITAL
BROADCASTING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a decade of planning, digital
high-definition television broadcasts are to begin in just a few
months, and so is the sale of HDTV sets.
</P>
<P>
   But the television industry is now conceding that most people
who buy one of these expensive new TV sets, ranging in price from
roughly $6,000 to $12,000, may face considerable difficulty
actually seeing the new crystal-clear programming. That is because
the first digital sets will be incapable of receiving any
high-definition programming if it comes in via cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really taken aback when I learned this,'' said Susan
Ness, a commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission. ``It
doesn't really make sense to me that this was allowed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is just one of several problems that have become
apparent in the final weeks before the transition to digital
broadcasting begins. Among other difficulties, HDTV is incompatible
with most existing direct-broadcast satellite equipment, while in
some cities broadcasters are having trouble finding sites for
towers for the their new digital antennas. A new task force headed
by Ms. Ness will tackle that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six network-owned television stations in the nation's 10
largest cities are scheduled to begin digital broadcasting by Nov.
1, and almost every major manufacturer of televisions plans to
introduce high-definition television sets by then.
</P>
<P>
   And although a few of the TV stations say they may not make the
deadline, it is the cable television problem that could raise the
biggest obstacle to consumer acceptance of HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the nation's television viewers are cable
subscribers, who typically receive their cable channels as well as
over-the-air broadcast stations through the cable system.
</P>
<P>
   And cable executives believe that most buyers of the expensive
new HDTV sets will probably be their most desirable customers _
subscribers to expensive premium services and pay-per-view movies.
But to receive the HDTV signals from local broadcasters, these
people will have to bypass their cable boxes and resort to a
television antenna if they have any hope of receiving
high-definition programming.
</P>
<P>
   And even that is not a guaranteed solution. In recent tests,
more than 40 percent of the homes using indoor antennas were unable
to pick up a digital signal broadcast from WHD-TV, the experimental
high-definition station in Washington. But the percentage was far
better for homes with roof-top antennas, and industry executives
argue that the problem will be diminished when commercial stations
begin broadcasting HDTV at full power.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, most people are cable subscribers. And through the
spring, the major cable companies have been arguing with the
broadcasters and Congress about whether their new digital set-top
boxes would be capable of receiving HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in recent weeks, the cable companies agreed to
manufacture the boxes so they can receive the broadcasters'
high-definition signals _ and digital programming transmitted by
some cable services, including HBO and the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only half of the answer. The other half, the part
that was overlooked until it was too late, was how these signals
would be carried from the digital set-top boxes to the digital
sets. A special digital cable will be required.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the specifications for this cable _ the jacks into
which it plugs and the software for organizing the signal _ have
not been completed. As a result, none of the first generation of
HDTV's are expected to have the proper jacks to receive HDTV from a
cable box.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Green, president of Cable Labs, the research
organization that is coordinating inter-industry work on this
problem, said, ``Our little lab is pulling hard to get this done.''
But he said he did not expect the work to be completed until the
end of the summer _ far too late for the first HDTV sets that will
go on sale a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ed Milbourn, manager of advanced television planning for Thomson
Consumer Electronics, the nation's largest TV manufacturer, said
that even if the work were finished today, ``it's about four months
too late.'' As it is, digital sets that include the new digital
jacks probably will not go on sale until late 1999 or 2000 _
``unless we want to guess what the specification will be, and
that's a pretty expensive thing to guess on,'' Milbourn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole system works on standards,'' he added, ``and without
a standard we had nothing to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Perry, director of marketing for another big TV maker,
Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics, said he expected demand for
high-definition products to be rather low at first, because of this
shortcoming and other problems. Anticipating the possibility of
angry consumers, Mitsubishi's literature for its high-definition
products includes a disclaimer noting that viewers will not be able
to receive high-definition programming from cable.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bonan, a senior vice president for Sony Electronics Inc.,
said the company had been holding back on the final design for its
first HDTV, hoping this problem could be resolved in time. Today,
however, ``the chances are rapidly dwindling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, each segment of the industry blames the other
for this problem. But Green said his lab would try things through
``an experimental approach'' to solve this.
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate. But one answer, several industry
executives said, might be to design a second converter box that
would be inserted between the cable converter box and the digital
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea, Bonan said, might be a new stand-alone box that
translated the signal so it could be received through one of the
conventional jacks on the back of a TV. No one has suggested who
would build any of these boxes, though, or who would be expected to
pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   But the cable industry is not the only source of obstacles to
HDTV. About six million homes have direct-broadcast satellite
dishes. And these people _ proven early adopters of costly new
technology _ are expected to be heavily represented among the first
buyers of HDTV's.
</P>
<P>
   In January, DirecTV, the largest satellite company, announced
that it would begin broadcasting two channels of HDTV in the fall.
But more recently the company disclosed that anyone hoping to get
this new service would have to buy a new converter box _ and climb
up on the roof to replace their 18-inch satellite dish with a new,
larger model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that an antenna is a very low-cost piece of
equipment,'' said Jeffrey Torkelson, a spokesman for DirecTV. ``We
will try to make it as convenient as possible for people to make
the change.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not viewers will be able to receive the broadcasters'
new digital signals, most of the big-city television stations that
are to begin their digital broadcasts by Nov. 1 seem to be on
schedule equipping themselves. In reports to the FCC last month,
only stations in Chicago, Detroit and New York said they were
having trouble, and in most the cases the problem was getting new
towers built to hold their digital antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that other cities might face similar problems, the
FCC set up a tower ``strike force'' last week headed by Ms. Ness to
help stations resolve their problems. ``For competitive reasons,
some broadcasters might not want to say publicly that they are
having problems,'' Ms. Ness said. ``In those cases we can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the rocky state of the transition to digital
television, Milbourn said: ``Is it going to go perfectly smoothly?
No. It's going to stammer and stumble at the start. But are these
new sets going to make spectacular pictures? That I can
guarantee.'' &QL;

<P>
   A tiny company in Seattle is introducing a technology on Monday
that industry analysts say could loosen Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip
on the valuable real estate of personal-computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sets the rules for how the main screens, or desktops,
are used, because its Windows operating system has a near-monopoly
in the personal-computer market. Personal-computer makers are
permitted to put icons for starting software programs on the main
Windows screen, but only within the Windows environment and in
compliance with contract restrictions imposed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The company's contract restraints on what PC makers can do with
the Windows desktop are a key element in the antitrust suit filed
by the government against Microsoft last month. The Justice
Department and the 20 states that also sued the company argue that
the restrictions represent an abuse of Microsoft's market power.
Microsoft replies that its contracts protect the integrity and
uniformity of Windows, and thus benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle start-up, Pixel Co., has a software innovation that
is essentially an attempt to grab a slender band of the computer
screen, just beyond the desktop and outside Microsoft's contract
rules. It does this by occupying some unused screen space, called
the overscan area, about \-inch to {-inch along each edge of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's product is a control bar called My Space that sits on
the bottom edge of the screen, just below the Windows 95 task bar.
By clicking on a My Space icon, a user can link to a site on the
Internet's World Wide Web, control hardware like a CD player, or
start software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC, a large PC maker, plans to begin installing
Pixel's software in its computers for the home market later this
month, said Mal Ransom, a senior vice president at Packard Bell.
``This should allow us to have a more interactive relationship with
our customers, enabling us to connect them to any place we want to
take them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel says it is also talking to other PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   Online information and commerce sites have signed agreements
with Pixel to obtain prime placement of their icons on the My Space
control bar, the company said. These include bookseller Amazon.com,
ESPN, ABC News and Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel would collect revenue both from license deals with PC
makers and from fees paid by Web-site operators. Such arrangements
would give computer companies and Web programmers prime places on
the My Space bar, but the bar can also be customized by individual
users _ adding or removing icons, or deleting the bar altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts who have seen Pixel's software are impressed.
``Instead of just complaining about Microsoft's control of the
screen, this company has figured out a way around the problem,''
said Rob Enderle, an analyst for Giga Information Group, a research
firm. ``This could be a technology with legs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Computers are generally shipped with the slender bands of unused
screen space partly to ensure that if the monitor is jostled in
transit, none of the display is obscured. But many companies,
schools and stores set up personal computers so that Windows
occupies the entire screen, including the overscan area.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pixel's business plan rests on the assumption that the
overscan area is open real estate _ outside Microsoft's direct
control.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's managers and legal adviser are experienced in dealing
with Microsoft. Pixel is a unit of Ark Interface II, a computer
interface designer that until recently was a wholly owned
subsidiary of Packard Bell NEC.
</P>
<P>
   Ark had developed a ``shell'' program for Packard Bell in 1994,
called Navigator, that ran on top of Windows 3.1 and tried to make
computers easier to use. Last month, Packard Bell NEC sold Ark to a
group of investors, including Pixel's management team.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel, its managers say, was born of a sense of frustration with
Microsoft's contract restrictions. ``The contracts changed every
year, and 15 months ago they really closed up,'' said Tom O'Rourke,
the president of Pixel. ``That forced us to think outside the box _
at least outside the Windows desktop.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical challenge of devising a way to use the overscan
space fell to David Nason, Pixel's vice president of research, a
computer scientist who formerly worked for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel filed a patent application for its technology last
November, and the patent approval process typically takes 18 months
or so.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's legal adviser is Robert Steinberg, a partner at Irell &AMP;
Manella in Los Angeles. Steinberg is an intellectual-property
expert who wrote the patent for data-compression technology that
became the center of a legal dispute between Microsoft and Stac
Electronics Inc., which Steinberg represented.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a jury ordered Microsoft to pay Stac $120 million for
patent infringement. Microsoft appealed but settled the case for an
estimated $50 million and took a 15 percent stake in Stac.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel's patent application, Steinberg said, is intended to
``protect the visual real estate'' of the overscan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question here is whether Microsoft is going to
challenge this and claim that even the overscan area belongs to
Microsoft,'' said Steinberg. ``If it does, that would represent an
aggressive expansion of its desktop, pushing others aside at a time
when it faces a major antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had not yet seen
the Pixel software, and could not comment on it.

ROOTED IN OLD SOD, MUSIC GROWS ALL OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not quite the musical analog to Thomas Cahill's
``How the Irish Saved Civilization,'' the best-selling book
blending Irish history, folklore and myth-making that argues that
Western culture would not have survived without the Irish monks who
saved and spread the works of antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   But there is clearly something that transcends music at the
second American incarnation of the Guinness Fleadh, billed as ``the
ultimate Irish Music and Culture Festival'' and scheduled for
Saturday and Sunday on Randalls Island and then moving on to
Chicago and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleadh (pronounced FLAH) _ with its blend of Irish (Sinead
O'Connor, the Chieftains, the Corrs) and distinctly non-Irish (Los
Lobos, Tracy Chapman, Patti Smith, Chumbawamba) music, Irish
literary readings, crafts and exhibits _ is partly a glimpse of the
new, high-concept dynamics of summer festivals, which have evolved
a long way from the time when all it took to draw people was loud
music, tight halter tops, hot stadiums and cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a window onto the remarkable renaissance of Irish
and Irish-American culture, all the more striking in light of the
optimism that followed last month's peace referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the Fleadh (the word means festival) is the
traditional Irish musical celebrations going back centuries. But if
its roots are traditional, it highlights two revealing
contradictions in contemporary Irish culture.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the remarkably ecumenical quality of Irish culture:
how music that is so intensely rooted in Irish soil seems to travel
so well and include so much far-flung music amicably under the same
tent. The second is the odd way that traditional Irish culture
seems to be blossoming, often in all sorts of unlikely amalgams, in
an Ireland that, for better or worse, is finally becoming
integrated into the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish experience, in the United States and at home, of
course, has had more than its share of brutishness and intolerance.
Indeed, the welcoming qualities of the music have often been at
odds with numbing parochialism, whether in Northern Ireland or
South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But from the plays of Martin McDonagh and the poetry of Seamus
Heaney to the enormous success of Frank McCourt's memoir,
``Angela's Ashes,'' and pop Irish folk culture like ``Riverdance,''
to Irish music, which is flourishing in diverse forms as never
before, the Fleadh seems well timed to catch a cresting moment of
interest in all things Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always been a very deep current of affection
for the Irish in American culture,'' said Cahill, ``but Ireland was
too oppressed and bedraggled and concerned with its own troubles
and inferiority complex to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in the late 20th century is that Ireland has
come into its own as a place that could support the arts, so now
you see Irish culture taking off like crazy, and not just there or
in the U.S. You go to Italy, and they're just nuts for Irish music
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is definitely at the center of the Fleadh, which will
include about 60 acts on three music stages plus a fourth for
literature and theater Saturday and Sunday on Randalls Island.
There will be about 30 acts for each of the one-day festivals June
20 in Chicago and June 28 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Among other acts scheduled this year are the Irish musicians
Tommy Makem, the Saw Doctors and Altan and Mary Black, and
non-Irish musicians like Nanci Griffith, John Lee Hooker, Wilco and
the Indigo Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Long before anyone envisioned huge, big-bucks marketing
extravaganzas, the fleadhs existed in Ireland as loose-knit musical
celebrations. They careered along amiably for centuries as
provincial festivals with musicians playing in pubs and on street
corners, became more institutionalized in the 1950s, often
including musical competitions, and have continued to grow from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the pipes at my first one in Mullingar in 1950,''
said Paddy Moloney, from the traditional Irish band the Chieftains.
``It was a wonderful thing, but no one expected it to grow into
what it's become.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the English promoter, Vince Power of the Mean Fiddler
Organization, staged the first of his London Fleadhs, which have
been huge annual events ever since. The first American Guinness
Fleadh was staged last year on Randalls Island by Mean Fiddler and
Festival Marketing of New York and produced by Joe Killian, who
founded the Central Park Summerstage concerts and was director of
concerts for Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a cynic to think that commercial as well as
artistic instincts went into the decision to build the American
fleadhs around both Irish musicians and big-name non-Irish
performers. But one of the most remarkable aspects of the event is
the way the intensely Irish focus meshes so well with acts ranging
from the Latino rock of Los Lobos to the Texas honky-tonk of Joe
Ely to singer-songwriters like Ms. Chapman or Ms. Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians say that partly reflects the nature of much American
music, which has deep roots in Irish and Celtic folk songs and
ballads, and the musical affinity between so much of the music of
the Western world and Irish music.

   Music as `Part of the Genetic Code'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something, we felt more at home in Ireland than
we did in South America,'' said Steve Berlin of the eclectic rock
band Los Lobos, who appeared with the Chieftains two years ago on
``Santiago,'' an album that explored the Gaelic and Spanish music
of Northern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what it is,'' he said. ``But there's a specific
and almost palpable similarity between Irish culture and Mexican
culture. Maybe it's the way that music is everywhere. It's part of
the genetic code of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The affinity no doubt also mirrors the way the Irish diaspora
and its traditions suffuse American life. Thus, bands at the Fleadh
include groups like the Prodigals, New York-based Irish-Americans
who borrow from both cultures but whose music is still indelibly
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Irish music travels so well because at its roots
the culture has always been both intensely local and possessed by a
sort of visceral pantheism. Cahill says Irish culture from
antiquity has always had the same ecumenical qualities as it does
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, Irish culture was always a mix of pagan and
Christian; it's always had very emotional ties to the earth, to
cosmic events, to the idea of the world as a magical place,'' he
said. ``In that sense it's very flexible, protean, transportable.
So the druidic aspects of Irish culture have a lot in common, for
example, with the nature religions of North America.''
</P>
<P>
   The other striking aspect of the Irish music at the Fleadh is
how amazingly diverse it is, but how much even the most stridently
modern music is still animated by traditional Irish sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for example, the Saw Doctors, a popular, raucous Irish
rock band that got together in the small Galway County town of Tuam
in 1987, include both primal rock sounds with melodies and
instrumentation _ pipes, flutes, tin whistles _ that could be
nothing but Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the first generation of Irish people to have grown up
listening to traditional Irish music in the age of mass media,''
said Leo Moran, a guitarist and singer in the group. ``We're the
first generation who grew up with TV and radio, who could want to
mix the Ramones with traditional Irish songs. So I like to borrow
from all my favorite kinds of music: Hank Williams, Steve Earle,
English punky stuff. But I've still got traditional Irish music in
my blood, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity, economic and cultural, of course, could be
short-lived and the Irish sense of tragedy is deep enough to make
anyone wonder how long this vogue lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current moment feels like a wry, Irish joke on
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been the the victimized, not the victimizers, the
colonized, not the colonizers'' said Andrea Corr of the Corrs,
three sisters and a brother from Dundalk, Ireland, whose band
combines modern pop and traditional Irish sounds. ``And now, in
music, in literature, the Irish seem to be everywhere. It's very
ironic, isn't it?''

`PARK CITY': DISSECTING YUPPIES WITH PRECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``But oh, Bobecito, we are already no longer young,'' says the
narrator to herself in response to a Bob Dylan lyric in the title
story of Ann Beattie's strong new collection, ``Park City: New and
Selected Stories.'' The narrator, who's looking after her half
sister's boyfriend's daughter, Lyric, at a fantasy resort in Park
City, Utah, continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``What compounds the problem is that once any group starts to be
condescended to in the guise of being catered to _ once yuppies say
yes, and buy the yuppified Oreos they're offered _ it's all over.
They're taking the bait, they're eating saltpeter, they're becoming
impervious to excess, and to surprise. They're just more people
trying to keep up the excitement level by having adventure
weddings, adventure honeymoons, adventure babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beattie's previous fiction comprises six novels (``Chilly
Scenes of Winter,'' ``Falling in Place,'' ``Love Always,''
``Picturing Will,'' ``Another You'' and ``My Life, Starring Dara
Falcon'') and five story collections (``Distortions,'' ``Secrets
and Surprises,'' ``The Burning House,'' ``Where You'll Find Me''
and ``What Was Mine''), and while the message of the statement
about yuppies is implicit almost everywhere, never before has it
been articulated so overtly.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this outspokenness is characteristic of all eight
new stories in this volume, which range from seven to nearly 40
pages and are followed by selections from Ms. Beattie's previous
collections. These are arranged chronologically, which allows the
reader to trace the development of the author's technique.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets one see the contrast between the latest stories and
the earliest, an experience of sufficient subtlety and complexity
to reduce one in this limited space to the following gross
generalizations: Gone is the deadpan style of the early and middle
stories, in which Ms. Beattie lays out on a dissecting table the
behavior of her disaffected postcounterculture yuppies and then
leaves it up to the reader to do the anatomizing.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, are the stabs of lyricism of the middle period,
particularly the endings that try poetically to recapitulate the
story's action but feel tacked on and artificial.
</P>
<P>
   In the new stories, definite events dominate the action: A young
man dies of AIDS (``Second Question''); an 8-year-old boy confesses
to a theft that has caused the dismissal of a falsely accused
cleaning lady (``Cosmos''); a young man commits an act of emotional
vandalism (``Zalla''); a couple becomes embroiled in a bitter
marital spat that lasts for four days (``The Four-Night Fight'').
</P>
<P>
   But more significant, the narrator's attitude seems definite. In
``Cosmos,'' the woman who is living with the thieving boy's father
decides not to walk out even though she has just learned the father
has been cheating on her. The title's several meanings suggest that
order is being imposed on chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Four-Night Fight,'' the husband finally makes peace
through a touching gesture of apology. The narrator seems relieved,
concluding with only the faintest echo of irony, ``What couple does
not occasionally fight?''
</P>
<P>
   In the best of these stories, Ms. Beattie's ability both to
commit herself and to knit her commitment into the finest
needlework of her artistry contrasts sharply with the irritating
moral passivity of her earlier work.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that she's not as amusingly inventive as
ever. In ``Zalla,'' the narrator explains that at night the title
character, a woman from Belize, ``watches James Bond movies over
and over on my mother's VCR.'' The narrator continues: ``My mother
sits in the TV room with her, rereading Dickens. She says the James
Bond movies provide wonderful soundtracks for the stories. Carly
Simon singing `Nobody Does It Better' in `The Spy Who Loved Me' as
my mother's reading about Mr. Pickwick.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Siamese Twins Go Snorkeling,'' the subtle connections
among a bartender, a couple he house-sits for in Key West and a
dying reef are effectively summed up by a sponge cutout of two
figures joined at the hip floating on the surface of a
tropical-fish aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Beattie's earlier stories, the ones in ``Park City''
concern people trapped, love betrayed, children abused, emotions
diminished, friends failing to communicate, life running down,
senses becoming blurred.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These themes are all touched upon in the brilliant title story,
where the precocious 14-year-old Lyric says of the resort where the
characters are staying: ``I'd actually say there's something
de-energizing about this place. But that's true of any place that
seems artificial, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the story's language doesn't become de-energized, as it
might have done in one of the author's earlier phases. Instead it
makes its points with striking imagery. When the narrator has a
three-dimensional computer-generated photograph taken of herself,
she foresees what will happen to her as a result of the shocks she
is about to undergo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the background, I selected rockets being fired, but when
you first looked at the picture it seemed to be just nice abstract
shades of red and yellow in a sort of herringbone pattern. I
apparently selected some other element I didn't realize I was
choosing, because when I saw the picture, all the rockets were
rising as a maze, and I was above the maze, floating `2001'-ish,
tipped slightly forward. I ended up looking like some monstrous
apparition with weird war paint that had already descended from
space while the rockets were wasting their time going exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   The rockets that go off in the best of these new stories waste
nobody's time, neither theirs nor ours.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will grip much of the Northeast. Low pressure
swirling off the New England coast will draw moist air into the
interior, resulting in ample clouds and showers. A few rumbles of
thunder are also possible. Highs will be more than 10 degrees below
normal. Brisk winds from the northwest will enhance the chill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high pressure will nose from the lower Great Lakes
states to the southeast coast. Sinking air currents will lead to
bright sunshine from the Deep South to the Middle Atlantic States.
Cumulus clouds will develop in the Appalachians, as rising warm air
mixes with chilly air aloft.
</P>
<P>
   A potent storm system will affect the middle part of the
country. A slug of moist air will be forced to rise over a dome of
cool air stretching from the northern Rockies to Middle West. The
result will be areas of light to moderate rain from Illinois to the
western High Plains. Embedded thunder is also expected. Clouds and
showers will steadily march through the Ohio Valley into Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air to the south of the warm front will ignite several
clusters of thunderstorms across parts of Texas and the southern
Plains. Some storms will produce hail and damaging wind gusts.
Otherwise, seasonable warmth and fresh breezes from the southwest
will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   A pocket of cold air near 18,000 feet will help trigger patches
of mountain showers and thunder across much of the West. Valley
locations will have a mixture of clouds and sunshine. The Southwest
will be sunny and seasonably hot, while morning fog and low clouds
dot the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Modern Chill
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days, record low temperatures for early June
have been set in many locations in the Plains and Middle West. Many
of the records that were broken date back to the early 1900s.
Modern air masses probably need to be colder than those of a
century ago to produce the same chill, especially in large
metropolitan areas. An ``urban heat island'' is created by the
activities and infrastructure of today's sprawling cities. At
night, this leads to temperatures that are several degrees higher
than the surrounding suburbs, where more extensive vegetation
retains less of the day's warmth.

   Magazine readers are by now blase about pages scented from the
samples in perfume advertisements. Beginning this fall, they will
find those and other samples in the editorial pages as well.
</P>
<P>
   The September issue of Allure, a beauty magazine published by
Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications Inc., will feature
cosmetic samples with some of its articles. The items, in enclosed
packets, will include perfumes, lipstick, creams and blushes from
such companies as Estee Lauder, Revlon and Prescriptives. The
October issue of Glamour will do the same. Each sample will be
clearly identified by the company it comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going from black-and-white TV to color TV,'' said
Linda Wells, the editor in chief of Allure. ``If you look at
photographed swatches of makeup, you can't make a leap between,
`OK, it looks good on the page, but how is it going to look on
me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wells described advertisers' reaction to the idea as
``absolute elation.'' Indeed, Robert Nielsen, the president of
Prescriptives, said: ``To have an opportunity to have an editorial
position from Allure _ I think it's extraordinary. We would expect
to see some wonderful, positive sell-through results.''

   Ms. Wells said she was not concerned that readers might confuse
Allure's editorial features with advertisements. ``We're designing
the page the way we ordinarily design a page,'' she said. ``The
presentation of samples will not look in any way like an
advertising sample.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea originated on the business side of Conde Nast. It
was the brainchild of Catherine Viscardi Johnston, an executive
vice president in charge of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that advertisers are excited about this,
but we had to make the decision based solely on the editorial
merits,'' Ms. Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnston would not disclose the cost of the project, but she
said it was very expensive and that Conde Nast was regarding it as
a trial. While the cosmetics companies will provide the bulk
product at their own expense, the process of inserting the samples
into the magazines will be handled at Conde Nast's expense by
Arcade, a New York-based company that manufactures and prints
sampling technologies.

   NBC Ends Ban on `Dirty Work' Ads
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's update: The movie ``Dirty Work'' can buy
commercials on NBC after all.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of confrontation between an NBC executive and one
of the network's former stars, the president of NBC, Bob Wright,
decided to call off the advertising ban on the coming MGM movie. At
least one commercial for the movie will now appear on NBC next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the executive, Don Ohlmeyer, the president of
NBC's West Coast division, put out word that the network would not
accept commercials for the movie because it stars Norm Macdonald, a
former comedian on ``Saturday Night Live.'
</P>
<P>
   There was bad blood between the two: Ohlmeyer has been engaged
in an ongoing dispute with Macdonald over the decision to remove
him from his regular post as the anchor of the Weekend Update
segment on that show. Macdonald's reaction to that decision, in
appearances on ``Late Show With David Letterman'' and other
programs, angered Ohlmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   MGM was forced to change its media plan for the film, losing
some valuable exposure in such NBC broadcasts as the National
Basketball Association playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   According to NBC executives, Wright did not oppose Ohlmeyer's
original decision because he thought the commercials were only
scheduled to appear in an edition of ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that MGM's commercials were dropped from
other NBC shows, Wright decided the situation had gone far enough.
He told the NBC sales department that if MGM called to repurchase
time on the network, they were to be told the network would agree.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Rich, the head of marketing for MGM, said that as soon as
he was informed of NBC's change of heart he immediately got in
touch with NBC's sales executives Friday to buy back the $500,000
commercial he had lost during the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was a chance to get that spot back,'' Rich said.
The commercial for Macdonald's movie is now scheduled to appear in
Game 4 of the playoffs on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Sue Editor for Defamation
</P>
<P>
   Feelings among the laid-off reporters from The Arizona Republic
and its defunct sister paper, The Phoenix Gazette, were raw enough
before The Columbia Journalism Review quoted their former managing
editor as saying that most of those laid off were ``fat, lazy,
incompetent and slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The former editor, Steve Knickmeyer, had made the remark because
he was angered to discover that former Republic reporters had told
the author of a Columbia Journalism Review article that some of the
people were singled out for layoffs because their coverage
irritated moneyed advertising interests.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the article appeared in January, Knickmeyer
disappeared from the newsroom. But it may have been too late: Last
week, 18 of the laid-off reporters filed suit for defamation,
contending that the remarks were made ``in reckless disregard for
the truth and were calculated to cause severe emotional distress to
plaintiffs and damage their reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will defend the paper vigorously in the case _ we think
it's without merit,'' said David Bodney, a lawyer representing the
newspaper, which is being sued along with Knickmeyer and the
paper's owner, Phoenix Newspapers Inc., a unit of Central
Newspapers Inc. ``It's one thing to say whether the statements
should have been issued in a perfect world. It's another to hold
the newspaper liable for them under the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Pets Get Their Own Book
</P>
<P>
   It takes a warm and cuddly puppy.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the first lady circuit, where Hillary Rodham Clinton
has decided to follow in the tradition of her predecessor and
fellow celebrity author, Barbara Bush, by producing a book devoted
to the first pets _ in this case Socks and Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, which published Mrs. Clinton's first book and
nonfiction best seller, ``It Takes a Village,'' approached her with
the idea for the book, ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy,'' which will
include an introduction from Mrs. Clinton and a selection of ``50
to 60 candid photographs'' of the first pets along with samples of
their fan letters from children.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, the young writers probe for political candor
from the first pets with questions such as: ``Who do you like best?
Clinton? Mrs. Clinton or Chelsea?'' Or there's the standard
suffocating-security question: ``Does the Secret Service cat bug
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's proceeds from the book _ which will be published
in November _will be donated to the National Park Foundation, a
nonprofit organization that is allied with the National Park
Service and raises funds for the parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having discussions with Mrs. Clinton about possible
projects since her first book,'' said Carolyn Reidy, president of
Simon &AMP; Schuster's trade division. ``She had this idea about doing
something with Socks, and then Buddy came into the picture. So we
asked questions about whether there were lots of letters to the
pets and they said there were tons. And she leapt on the idea of
letter-writing being a positive for children.''
</P>
<P>
   `Simple Abundance' Is Now a Press
</P>
<P>
   Writers write, publishers publish. But the Warner Books unit of
Time Warner Inc. is giving Sarah Ban Breathnach, best-selling
author of the women's spiritual guide ``Simple Abundance,'' the
opportunity to do both.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual arrangement, Ms. Ban Breathnach was named
publisher of a new imprint, the Simple Abundance Press, which will
issue four books a year in the booming spirituality and lifestyle
market, starting next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Warner, Maureen Egen, said Ms. Ban Breathnach
would share in the proceeds of the books, which she will acquire
but not write. Instead, she will choose topics and find authors
``who otherwise might not have a chance to be published.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ban Breathnach knows about that. ``Simple Abundance'' got 30
rejections before a Warner editor recognized its promise. After
Oprah Winfrey endorsed it, the book landed on the best-seller list
where it has remained for 113 weeks, a longevity enjoyed by only
three or four books that come out in any given year.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Warner will publish 750,000 copies of Ms. Ban
Breathnach's further spiritual musings, ``Something More,'' and
Warner has three other books under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ban Breathnach's imprint points to a recent trend, in which
publishers are agreeing to new kinds of financial partnerships with
brand-name authors.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Stephen King left his longtime publisher to be a
partner with Simon &AMP; Schuster's Scribner division for his next
three books, taking a smaller advance in exchange for a share in
the profits. Three months ago, the Pocket Books unit of Simon &AMP;
Schuster made a similar deal with the novelist Clive Cussler.

   HDTV Encounters Trouble As Its Debut Approaches
</P>
<P>
   Digital high-definition television broadcasts and the sale of
HDTV sets will begin by November.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the new crystal-clear programming promised by the HDTV
technology will not be available on those sets if the programming
comes in on cable. This is just one of several problems that have
become apparent in the final weeks before the transition to digital
broadcasting.

EUROPEAN LAWYERS IN BATTLE WITH U.S. ACCOUNTING FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's six largest accounting firms have plunged into the
legal business in Europe, leaving many European lawyers fighting
mad.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most heated battle between the accounting firms and
the law firms is now being waged in Paris, where names like
Deloitte et Touche Juridique et Fiscal and KPMG Fidal Peat
International now appear on lists of the city's law firms, much to
the annoyance of many members of the Paris bar.
</P>
<P>
   French lawyers and American lawyers are planning a summit
meeting on ``the accounting firm issue'' Monday in New York. The
Paris lawyers have come with a message for their American
colleagues: It is only a matter of time before the Big Six firms
snatch up legal work in America, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the accounting firms would have to go up
against legions of American lawyers to change laws that now prevent
lawyers and accountants from practicing together. But the Paris
lawyers say that barrier may not be as insurmountable as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   John Riggs, a member of both the Paris and New York bars and a
partner at White &AMP; Case in Paris, said France had similar laws but
they had not stopped the accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big,'' Riggs said of the accounting firms. ``They have
a lot of oomph.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the United States, the accounting firms are setting
up corporate law practices in many countries by hiring lawyers and
merging with whole law firms. KPMG now has 1,100 lawyers in France,
making it the country's largest law firm. Arthur Andersen recently
merged with one of Spain's top law firms to form Garrigues &AMP;
Andersen. And Price Waterhouse opened a law office in Moscow last
year, which it hopes will soon grow to 100 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Six firms are creating one-stop professional firms,
where companies can go for their annual audit, tax advice, legal
services and consulting on almost any business matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been successful because we can meet all of our
clients' demands,'' said Gerard Nicolay, managing partner of
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's law firm in France. He said that his firm's
revenues grew by 30 percent last year, while the overall market for
French legal services grew by just 5 percent. ``Obviously, our
competition, the traditional law firms, does not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firms, however, are reluctant to talk about their
aspirations in the United States for fear of stirring up opposition
from the American bar. ``We have no plans to acquire a U.S. law
firm,'' said Matthew Gonring, managing partner of communications at
Arthur Andersen, a firm that has been one of the most aggressive at
acquiring European law firms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are enough hints to cause American law firms to
squirm. For example, Price Waterhouse now has an alliance with
Miller &AMP; Chevalier, a law firm in Washington that has a large tax
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms refer clients to one another. And, the Big Six
firms have been hiring more and more lawyers in the United States.
But so far, those lawyers do little more than tax work.
</P>
<P>
   American lawyers, like their European counterparts, are
beginning to try to put up some defenses. A committee appointed by
the Texas Supreme Court, for instance, is investigating Arthur
Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche after Texas lawyers contended that
the two accounting firms were illegally practicing law. Both firms
deny the allegations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers argue that accounting firms should not practice law
because accountants owe duties to their clients that conflict with
the client obligations of lawyers. For instance, while accountants
must disclose any serious financial problems that they may discover
during the audit of a public company, lawyers must protect their
clients and keep client matters confidential. The lawyers also
argue that the Big Six are so large that there is a high
possibility that the interests of one client would conflict with
the interests of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we are just trying to protect our turf,'' said
Lawrence Fox, a lawyer at the Philadelphia law firm of Drinker,
Biddle &AMP; Reath, who moderated a debate on the issue at a conference
of the American Bar Association in May. ``I argue that we are
trying to protect our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   In most European countries, to ease some of those complaints,
the accounting firms have separated the lawyers from accountants by
creating separate law firms that are owned by the law partners.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, when Arthur Andersen decided to try to put
all its professionals under one roof, a Dutch court ruled that it
could not. The firm has appealed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to have one firm with everyone together,''
said Nick Prentice, Arthur Andersen's managing partner for tax and
legal services in Europe. ``Having two firms just adds costs so
that it is not in the client's best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said this battle was not really one between accountants
and lawyers, but a question of whether lawyers should be allowed to
practice with accountants and consultants in a single firm that he
described as ``multidisciplinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in our hearts,'' he said, ``that we are an
accounting firm.''

NEW INTERNET JOB SEARCH SERVICE FOR MID-LEVEL MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many companies, recruiting executives is like looking for
needles in a haystack. The Wall Street Journal and Korn/Ferry
International, a leading executive search firm, hope to use the
Internet to get the needles to emerge on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies plan to announce Monday a national rollout of
``Futurestep,'' a service that seeks to recruit midlevel managers
via the Web and match them with prospective employers. There is a
second high-technology twist: Futurestep automates the cumbersome
recruiting process by using software designed to match a person's
skills and interests with job types.
</P>
<P>
   The service is free to prospective employees, who fill out a
questionnaire at www.futurestep.com, listing background and job
interests. The software then grades the responses; it is capable of
determining what job and corporate culture an employee best fits,
said Man Jit Singh, the chief executive of Futurestep.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective employers who have submitted job openings to
Futurestep will receive a list of potential candidates selected
from the data base _ along with a videotaped interview of the top
prospects. If a company hires a candidate, it pays Futurestep 30
percent of the first year's cash salary, a standard executive
recruiting fee.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is aimed at reducing the time it takes to find
midlevel managers _ who typically make between $75,000 and $200,000
_ and thus make the process cost effective, said Michael Boxberger,
chief executive of Korn/Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, The Wall Street Journal, a unit of Dow Jones &AMP;
Co., hopes to capitalize on the success of its executive recruiting
classified advertising, which presently is the single largest
classified category in the print version of The Journal, said Mike
Wilson, the company's director of classified advertising. The
Journal plans to make Futurestep a component of its Wall Street
Journal Interactive Edition career site, www.careers.wsj.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal will also seek to entice its print-based advertisers
to participate. The advertisers can put the Futurestep Web address
on their advertisements then have Futurestep sort incoming resumes.

CABLE, INTERNET GAINING AS NEWS SOURCE FOR AMERICANS, SURVEY
FINDS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following a pattern seen in entertainment viewing, Americans now
watch news programs on cable television networks about as regularly
as those on broadcast networks, according to a survey by the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that the number of people who get
their news from the Internet is rising rapidly and they estimated
that almost as many people use the Internet on a typical weekday as
spend time reading a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of American adults, or an estimated 36 million
people, get news from the Internet at least once a week, the survey
found, compared with 6 percent, or about 11 million, two years ago,
when Pew conducted a similar survey. Those who use the Internet for
news are disproportionately younger, better educated and more
affluent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   As for television, more than half of those surveyed said they
watch the news with a remote control in their hands, poised to
change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quixotic audience,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the
Washington-based Pew research group. ``Post-Cold War, people say
local news is much more important to them than national or
international news. We found that in the survey and in focus groups
afterward, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Americans who watch the network evening news
and local news only on broadcast television has fallen to 15
percent, from 30 percent five years ago, according to the telephone
survey of 3,002 adults conducted April 24 to May 11.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey done two years ago, Kohut said, ``We found all
news viewership going down, but this time the slide is limited to
broadcast networks and to a certain extent CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 40 percent of Americans said they regularly watched one of
the leading cable news networks (CNN, CNBC, MSNBC or Fox News
Channel), while 57 percent said they watched the major broadcast
networks' morning, evening and prime-time news programs regularly.
When the Weather Channel and ESPN's Sports Center program are
added, the cable figure grows to 60 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   These responses may seem inconsistent with Nielsen ratings,
which show most cable news networks getting minuscule ratings.
Gregory Flemming, one of the survey's directors, said this was
because Nielsen measures actual viewership by program or time
period, while the survey's tally of viewers who say they watch
``regularly'' might include people who watch only one show a day
(but almost every day) or people who tune in for a few minutes
several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Only 38 percent described themselves as regular viewers of the
ABC, CBS or NBC evening news broadcasts, compared with 60 percent
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious advantage for the cable news networks is that they
have news around the clock, unlike the broadcast networks. Most
Americans said they would turn to cable channels first if a big
news event broke. Indeed, 46 percent of Americans surveyed said
they only follow national news when a major event is occurring, and
67 percent said that is the only time they follow international
news.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The survey found the average American spends an hour a day
absorbing news _ whether from television, radio or newspapers _ but
the amount of time varies widely with age. Older people watch and
read more news than younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, young people are the most likely to go online to
get news, and even though they pursue news less often, large
numbers of young people said they enjoyed having the wide variety
of choice in news sources that is available today.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate Pew survey about the credibility of news
organizations, conducted May 7-13 among 981 adults, CNN ranked
highest in ``believability'' among broadcast and cable television
sources, with CBS's ``60 Minutes'' second. The syndicated tabloid
television show ``Inside Edition'' ranked lowest, with National
Public Radio second lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The survey broke down respondents by age, income and whether
they were occasional, moderate or frequent news viewers.
Information about the survey may be obtained from the Pew Center
for Research on the People and the Press, 1150 18th Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20036, or on the Internet at

MOVIE MUNCHIES BEYOND POPCORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TERESA TALERICO  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forget popcorn, hot dogs and soda. Dump those
Raisinets. Nachos? Too cheesy.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you hit your local movie theater to catch
``Godzilla'' or ``Hope Floats,'' you might just be ordering a
single tall latte.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, theaters have introduced a new line of
snacks to tempt filmgoers who give thumbs-down to traditional movie
munchies.
</P>
<P>
   The options range from coffee and cookies, espresso and
biscotti, fancy fruit drinks and bottled water to self-serve
gourmet candy.
</P>
<P>
   If they haven't already, they're probably coming soon to a
theater near you.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman Fisher, a spokesman for Cineplex Odeon, which has 15
theaters in the Seattle area, said movie houses are competing with
video rentals for business. Owners are looking for new ways to lure
customers back into those seats. Movie theaters make profits almost
exclusively from their snack bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to expand is through concessions,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Many small, artsy movie houses have for years sold
unconventional snacks to appease their customers' bohemian tastes.
But the treats began appearing in mainstream theaters about five
years ago, when many began featuring self-serve bins of bulk candy,
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   This appeals to customers who are more selective but still have
a sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're hungry for something sweet, but not wanting a
half-pound box of Dots, that's the way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative beverages soon followed, including coffee, bottled
water and juices.
</P>
<P>
   At Cineplex Odeon's Meridian theater in downtown Seattle, you
can buy espresso, latte, mocha and even hot tea at Cine Cafe, a
coffee stand near the regular concessions. The cafe also sells
cookies, brownies and biscotti.
</P>
<P>
   But the Academy Award still goes to popcorn. Cafe vendor Edward
Isakson leaned on the counter and admitted that business is slow.
Not far away, a couple loaded up on more traditional snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to the movies, they're thinking popcorn and
candy,'' he said. ``You don't drink tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher conceded that options like movie cafes haven't grabbed
the multitudes quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still popcorn and soda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like betting on an underdog at the Oscars, this battle to seduce
moviegoers with new treats is an uphill one.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of filmgoers prefer popcorn, soft drinks and
candy, according to Cineplex Odeon studies. Movie theaters now want
to entice the 20 percent who historically turn up their noses at
conventional concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, wooing filmgoers can be even more difficult,
considering the city's often pretentious tastebuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A city like Seattle is, without question, more discriminating
than most cities,'' Fisher said. ``The best example is the
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cine Cafes are springing up all over Cineplex Odeon theaters.
But downtown Seattle is the only one that uses a local coffee
roaster _ Seattle's Best Coffee. ``We take into heavy consideration
where we're plopping a new theater,'' Fisher said. ``And Seattle is
the king of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Tastes vary depending on geographic region.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, nachos are still among the most popular movie
snacks, he said. In smaller towns, nothing beats a hot dog at the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   At several Seven Gables Landmark theaters, which specialize in
art movies and independent films, java and pastries have long been
a staple for the more intellectual crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro and the Seven Gables, both in Seattle's University
District, have served espresso and cookies for 10 years. Customers
love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They range from college students to grandmothers, but they're
all looking for literary films,'' said Teri White, a district
manager for the theater chain. ``They're not looking for the
crash-up, bang-up. And they're much more likely to buy a cookie and
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so at the Meridian on a recent afternoon. Whether they were
watching ``Woo'' or ``Deep Impact,'' most moviegoers seemed to
prefer hot buttered popcorn and Sprite to chocolate-chip cookies
and Earl Grey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's habit,'' said Patti Fiorito as she paid for her popcorn
before going into ``He Got Game.'' ``I can't watch a movie without
it. With all that butter, I think it's addictive.''

A LITTLE KITCHEN ARTISTRY STAVES OFF HUNGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is sometimes a slight disagreement between the Kelvinator
Ko-pilots in our kitchen. It's not that we fight over the last pork
chop on the platter. What we have is a philosophic debate as to who
is ``supposed'' to get the last pork chop on the platter.
</P>
<P>
   Alice argues that I get it because I'm bigger, although not
necessarily smarter. I feel everything should be evenly divided. I
can't immediately lay my hands on the document, but I believe
disposition of the odd pork chop is dictated in our marriage
license. What I think it says is, ``Whack! Right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't admit it. But I believe that, down deep, Alice is
convinced she will not be considered a serious artist unless she is
allowed to starve a little.
</P>
<P>
   Writers do not have this compulsion, a fact I can prove to
anybody willing to take a position behind a journalist in a buffet
line. (In one of my first communications school lectures, the
professor described a ``journalist'' as ``a newspaperman out of a
job.'')
</P>
<P>
   Aha! But all newspapermen think they are covering The Last
Supper and accordingly handle their knives and forks like fencing
foils.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``starving artist'' usually appears on posters
advertising the sale of $49 oil paintings at the Holiday Inn. I'm
pretty sure Alice would actually starve before she would paint an
eagle clutching the American flag as it flies over Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Monet painted precious few American eagles. The same can be said
for Cezanne. Not only did they avoid starvation, they enjoyed long,
leisurely meals and took great interest in recipes and their
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Alice discovered these biographical insights and actually tested
a couple of recipes reprinted in the ``Cooking Journals of Claude
Monet.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few adjustments she recently produced these meals.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's Mixed Vegetable Soup
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dried green or yellow peas
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks, white parts only, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups turnip greens, stems removed. (Monet called for sorrel)
</P>
<P>
   1 head of iceberg lettuce, trimmed and shredded (or 3 cups other
lettuce or spinach)
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs chervil (or parsley)
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-size potatoes, peeled and cut in chunks
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 can low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   Monet's recipe called for sorrel, which tastes like a cow's cud.
We substituted turnip greens, but you could use fresh spinach. We
used evaporated milk instead of cream because, well, to tell you
the truth, Monet looked like he was putting on a few pounds in his
later years.
</P>
<P>
   Soak dried peas in water for two hours, then drain. Heat oil in
pot, add onion, leeks, turnip greens, lettuce and chervil. Cook
over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables
are well-coated; do not let them brown.
</P>
<P>
   Add the dried peas and potatoes, then the broth. Season with
salt and pepper and bring to boil. Cover and simmer over very low
heat for at least 2 hours. Puree in food processor (eat your heart
out, Claude) return to heat and add milk. Reheat, stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Serves six to eight.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have noticed, this soup contains no pork chops or
veal shanks, so division is not a consideration. The following
recipe contains portions of fish and they are so good I might try
to sneak the extra piece into my bowl, when Alice isn't looking.
</P>
<P>
   Cod Soup Cezanne
</P>
<P>
   1 pound true cod
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 leeks sliced (white part only)
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon powdered cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon saffron (or one-quarter teaspoon turmeric)
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Cut the fish into at least 8 pieces. Dust with flour. Heat oil
in a skillet and saute the fish, turning once, until firm. Remove
to a warm plate before it browns.
</P>
<P>
   Pour any oil remaining in pan into a soup pot. Add the potatoes
and cook about 10 minutes covered, or until almost cooked through.
Remove to a warm plate. To the same pot add the leaks, pepper,
cloves, garlic, parsley, saffron and bay leaf plus whatever flour
is left over after you dusted the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the pot once or twice, as the flour browns. Add the broth,
bring to a boil, then cover and simmer 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the fish and potatoes into the soup and reheat. This
should serve six modest appetites or four starving artists.

COMMENTARY: NO SLOTS FOR TOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Confession time: At the age of 13, I was avidly
watching a crap game in the stairwell of Joan of Arc Junior High in
New York when a monitor caught us. Penalty: no diploma or handshake
from the principal at graduation. Ma gave me hell.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson may be at the root of my lifelong passion against
gambling. I believe that casino operators are predators; that
state-sponsored lotteries make a mockery of public policy; that
politicians who are on the take from gambling interests are
wallowing in the occasion of sin, and that Indian tribal leaders
who have turned aboriginal Americans into a croupier class are
contemptible. (Nothing wrong with gin rummy at home.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of my banging a moralizing spoon against the
highchair, gambling is growing. The sucker who used to be born
every minute is now born every second. The recent ``Powerball''
lottery was front-page news in respectable newspapers; nobody did a
story on the kids who went unfed providing its huge payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Now that organized gambling has become a $25-billion-a-year
industry, it is buying protection from politicians. An independent
counsel has had to be appointed to find out how high-bidding Indian
tribes may have corrupted the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   Not all pols are vulnerable. Liberals like Ralph Nader know that
gambling is a tax on the poor; social conservatives like Gary Bauer
know that gambling substitutes get-rich-quick dreaming for the work
ethic. That leaves political pragmatists _ centrists with their
hands out _ as target for the gambling lobby's influence.
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers own a piece of the GOP's Trent Lott, from
casino-controlled Mississippi; he killed a Senate bill that would
have ended the ability of gamblers to deduct their losses, thereby
saving high-rolling millionaires $4 billion over a decade. And the
gambling lobby recently bought a chunk of Al Gore by kicking in
$700,000 for Democrats on the VP's last visit to the labor bosses'
pro-gambling orgy in Las Vegas. (Al's next fund-raiser: bingo for
Buddhists?)
</P>
<P>
   But one underfinanced little guy is driving the lobby up the
wall. He is Tom Grey, a Methodist minister from Illinois who
organized the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling.
Although Big Gambling's largess is buying influence in Washington,
Grey's outfit has helped local citizens' groups keep beating the
casino interests in state after state.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, for example, where I usually vote straight right
wing, Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, stands fast against
invasion by slot machines. If his Republican opponent goes soft on
slots or takes contributions in gamblers' chips, I'll split my
ticket this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Grey and friends badgered Congress into forming a National
Gambling Impact Study Commission. Although the gambling lobby was
able to infiltrate it with a Nevada casino operator and others
grinding casino-union axes, the majority report next June might
prove damning _ and make it more embarrassing for pols to skim
profits of riverboat roulette wheels.
</P>
<P>
   What should worry candidate Gore and GOP leaders most about the
commission's studies is ``slots for tots.'' If gambling is treated
merely as part of theme-park entertainment, harmless fun for the
whole family, then every casino and tribe will explode into the
Internet with their own Web sites. Every wired classroom desk would
become a casino table teaching a pernicious philosophy of
something-for-nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What worries the gambling industry most, however, is the
commission's investigation into gambling addiction. If it turns
out, as many psychiatrists suggest, that a significant number of
gamblers are compulsive, and were encouraged in their addiction by
the lure of casino advertising, then the gambling industry might
find itself in the position of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, among the legions of trial lawyers who were left out
of the great tobacco contingent-fee bonanza, some are staring at
the deep pockets of casinos, tribes, lobbyists and even
municipalities that may be shown to be partly responsible for the
damage caused to people's lives by taking advantage of a gambling
compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Picture a smooth trial lawyer pointing to his gambling-ruined
client, holding aloft a damning government document supported by
scientific testimony _ what are the odds on his winning a bundle?

<TEXT>
<P>
   What a rapid international education it has been for Richard
Brown, who traveled 500,000 miles last year and can hand out his
business card in any of 17 languages. Before becoming chief
executive of the far-flung global telecommunications company Cable
and Wireless PLC two years ago, Brown, an American, had been
outside the United States only twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to run this company having never been to England before
in my life,'' he said in an interview last week at the company's
headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Brown's focus has again turned to the United
States. Seeking to expand Cable and Wireless' presence in this
country, where so far it mainly resells long-distance service to
business customers, he agreed two weeks ago to buy a large portion
of the Internet business of MCI Communications for $625 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if approved by regulators, would give Cable and
Wireless one of the largest Internet operations in this country.
Yet such are the vagaries of the agreement, which is pegged to
MCI's pending acquisition by Worldcom, that Cable and Wireless
might conceivably wind up with a much larger chunk of the MCI
business _ or walk away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, who in two years has doubled Cable and Wireless
profit, is such an optimist that he speaks of the MCI deal as if it
were already done. ``We now are the first non-U.S.-based company to
be a tier-one Internet provider,'' he said. ``We have leap-frogged
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, like almost every executive in the telecommunications
industry, is deeply concerned these days about ``the others.'' The
industry is engaged in a race for financial, technical and
operational bulk in the widespread belief that the global
communications market will end up being dominated by a handful of
international giants.
</P>
<P>
   And Cable and Wireless may be the quintessential midsize
competitor in that race. Despite its global reach, it is smaller
than each of the three largest long-distance companies in the
United States _ AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint _ with $11.6 billion in
revenue last year. And it is larger than only the smallest of the
regional Bell companies, US West.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless actually had more revenue last year than
Worldcom, which recorded $7.4 billion in sales. But Worldcom has
something that Cable and Wireless, even under the energetic Brown,
has been less able to generate: buzz and momentum on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom was able to make a $37 billion bid to acquire MCI
because Worldcom's shares trade at such a hefty multiple to
earnings _ about 50 times estimated 1998 earnings, compared with
about 25 for Cable and Wireless' American depository receipts. That
allowed Worldcom to base its acquisition of MCI largely on stock
and to avoid the prospect of devastating its future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But the continued regulatory uncertainty over Worldcom's bid for
MCI threatens Brown's plan to become a major Internet competitor in
the United States and take the next step toward the front of the
industry's dash for mass.
</P>
<P>
   MCI would be selling the Internet unit to Cable and Wireless to
help streamline its takeover by Worldcom. But the European Union's
competitiveness commissioner, Karel van Miert, seems to have agreed
with foes of the MCI-Worldcom deal, principally GTE, that selling
part of MCI's Internet holdings to Cable and Wireless would not
sufficiently address antitrust concerns about MCI and Worldcom's
combined power in the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   And the Justice Department, which is also reviewing the proposed
acquisition and is working closely with van Miert, has not yet
indicated whether it plans to endorse the deal with Cable and
Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   All this could imperil Brown's Internet aspirations. But one
outcome might be his emerging with an even bigger slice of MCI's
strong Internet operation. That is because Worldcom is under
increasing pressure to complete the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is not finished by the end of the year, Worldcom
must pay about $1.6 billion in cash to MCI, and MCI could simply
walk away. Failing to complete the MCI deal would also be a big
blow to the image of Bernard Ebbers, Worldcom's chairman, on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   One easy way for Worldcom to win approval of the acquisition of
MCI would be to sell its own big Internet operation, called Uunet,
which Worldcom gained as part of its acquisition of MFS
Communications in 1996. But Uunet is Worldcom's crown jewel, and
its chief, John Sidgmore, is now Worldcom's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   So if regulators tell MCI and Worldcom to relinquish more
Internet assets, the additional pieces would almost surely come
from MCI. And the most likely beneficiary might be Cable and
Wireless.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, MCI has agreed to sell Cable and Wireless its business
of providing wholesale Internet access to other Internet service
providers, as well as 22 Internet nodes, or central traffic-control
hubs.
</P>
<P>
   And while Cable and Wireless does not have an automatic right of
first refusal to any additional Internet properties that MCI may
agree to sell _ like the unit that provides cyberspace access to
large corporations _ analysts say it is almost inconceivable that
Brown would not be given the first opportunity to bid on such
units, should MCI decide to sell.
</P>
<P>
   And according to people close to Brown, it is almost
inconceivable that he would not be interested. Cable and Wireless
is already one of the 10 largest long-distance carriers in the
United States, providing its service almost exclusively to business
customers. Adding Internet access to its menu would be attractive
to corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Brown is no stranger to wheeling and dealing. Ever
since he arrived at Cable and Wireless after nearly three decades
in the American telecommunications business, including a stint as
vice chairman of Ameritech, the company has been buying and selling
like a commodities trader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been at the helm we've done 19 deals valued at over
$18 billion,'' Brown said with pride.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Cable and Wireless has always been a company of
scattered interests. It came into being in 1929 through the merger
of many privately owned British companies, including Eastern
Telegraph Co., which laid the first submarine cable route from
Britain to India in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   The company remained private until it was nationalized in 1946
under the postwar Labor government. Its status changed again under
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, when the government sold half of
the company to the public in 1981 and the other half by 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But privatization was not a panacea for Cable and Wireless. When
Brown first arrived, the company was struggling. The previous
management team, led by a former politician, Lord Young, and by
James Ross, most of whose experience had been in the oil business,
had been forced out by the board.
</P>
<P>
   One of Brown's biggest deals was also the most controversial _
selling part of Cable and Wireless' largest overseas holding, Hong
Kong Telecom, to China's state telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were approaching the July 1997 handover of Hong Kong to
China from Britain,'' Brown said. ``Here we were with 15,000
employees in Hong Kong and a disproportionate amount of our revenue
and earnings in China. How do we stabilize that situation?''
</P>
<P>
   His answer: Sell 5.5 percent of Hong Kong Telecom to China
Telecom for $1.2 billion, increasing China Telecom's stake in Hong
Kong Telecom to 13 percent and leaving Cable and Wireless with 54
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a move still criticized by some analysts, Brown also agreed
to transfer additional shares in Hong Kong Telecom to China Telecom
at a future date, which will make Cable and Wireless just an equal
partner with the Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
   But in Brown's approach to the global telecommunications game,
control may ultimately be less important than clout. Many industry
executives predict that the result of all of his financial
maneuvering may one day be the sale of Cable and Wireless to
another company. Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE have been mentioned on
Wall Street as potential suitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to some analysts, a merger could be just what the
company needs to get to the next level. ``They are too small to
take on the high end of the market without a partner,'' said Andrew
Harrington, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   Brown himself seems quite open to the concept of his company's
being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets of the next century are outside of the United
States,'' he said. ``How does an American company become global?
Construct those networks yourself? It would take our lifetime. If
you buy most European companies, you get a country. Buy British
Telecom, you get Great Britain. Buy Telstra, you get Australia.
We're the only one you can buy and get the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he quickly added, ``But I'm not hanging a `for sale' sign
above the company.''

U.S. EXPECTED TO FILE SUIT AGAINST INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission is expected to file a
major antitrust lawsuit against Intel Corp. on Monday, and Intel
executives and lawyers, saying the very future of the company is at
stake, have vowed to fight the suit vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   The government is expected to accuse the company of using its
position as the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessor
chips to gain leverage in disputes with certain computer
manufacturers by withholding key technical information about its
chips. Because Intel's microprocessors serve as the brains for more
than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, the government
contends that the manufacturers cannot design new computers unless
Intel provides the technical data.
</P>
<P>
   After the FTC staff forwarded its recommendation for the
antitrust suit to the commissioners last week, Intel officials met
with the commission to voice their strong opposition. The
commission is scheduled to hold a closed meeting on Monday at which
it is expected to vote to approve the complaint and forward it to
one of the commission's administrative law judges for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Because the disputes at the heart of the case are between Intel
and two companies that are not currently major producers of PCs _
Intergraph Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. _ some industry
analysts have seen the prospect of an FTC action as largely
symbolic, rather than posing a true threat to Intel's business
activities. But Intel sees the stakes as high indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And in their meetings with the commissioners last week,
according to lawyers involved in the talks, Intel officials argued
that the company must retain the right to decide who has access to
the company's intellectual property, rather than cede that power to
the government. Describing this principle as enormously important,
Intel said it would appeal the case all the way to the Supreme
Court, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   FTC officials said they would discuss the case openly only after
it was filed, probably on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Calkins, who was general counsel for the FTC until
last year, said of Intel's stance: ``That sounds lovely. But I
would guess that the commission would find it wholly unpersuasive
for anyone to suggest that anyone with patents or copyrights can do
whatever they want with them without ever running afoul of
antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   And some other lawyers who are expert in antitrust law said
Intel's argument seemed based more on business and public relations
principles than on a persuasive argument in an antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But in their discussions with the commission, Intel presented
several more traditional legal arguments based on its
interpretation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The federal case would follow a similar lawsuit filed by
Intergraph, a maker of computer work stations. Intergraph's suit
contends that during a patent dispute between it and Intel, Intel
was trying to get access to certain patented microprocessor
technologies for which Intergraph owned the rights. As leverage,
the suit said, Intel refused to give Intergraph the product data
books that set out the specifications for Intel's Pentium II family
of microprocessors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That, and a similar problem with Digital Equipment, are at the
heart of the FTC's case. But the Intel lawyers and executives told
the commission that withholding the information was not an
antitrust violation because Intel is not in competition with
Intergraph _ or with the Digital division that makes PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they argued, Intel has the right to demand payment in
kind for the company's technical information.
</P>
<P>
   It's a question of ``value for value,'' said Steven Salop, an
antitrust expert at Georgetown University, who is serving as a
consultant to Intel for the FTC suit. ``Why shouldn't they be
allowed to charge for the information through a reciprocal exchange
of information?'' Intel argued that it had the right to withhold
information from Intergraph as long as Intergraph refused to turn
over the data Intel wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Morse, a Washington lawyer who was deputy director of
the FTC's Bureau of Competition until last December, saw the
problem in a different light. ``What Intel is doing here,'' he
said, ``is using its monopoly power to force other companies to
give up their intellectual property.'' Intergraph, in its suit,
said it had no alternatives for the microprocessors it needed other
than Intel, and a federal judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In its meetings last week, Intel also argued that public
statements from Intergraph and the other companies from which Intel
withheld information had indicated that their businesses had not
been harmed as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be a useful public relations argument,'' said Kevin
Arquit, a New York lawyer who is a former FTC official, ``but I
don't think it will be persuasive at the commission. There's no way
to know if they would not have been even more profitable if Intel
hadn't done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intel lawyers and executives contended that under antitrust
law, it must be proved that Intel's behavior harmed competition not
in the computer manufacturing business but in Intel's industry _
the microprocessor business. What is more, the Intel lawyers
argued, Intergraph did not appear to have been greatly harmed,
either. And in any case, Intel contended, Intergraph is such a
small player that a significant harm to the overall computer
industry was not possible.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, Morse said, that the FTC will have to prove harm to
competition. ``But the commission doesn't have to find dead bodies
on the highway,'' he added. ``They just have to show that the
company's behavior harmed innovation by Intergraph or others. Will
companies engage in research and development if they think that
Intel is going to come in and take their R&AMP;D away from them?'' If
they do not pursue such research, he said, then competition in the
industry is harmed.
</P>
<P>
   But Salop, Intel's adviser, said, ``I think the FTC is relying
on theories rather than proof with respect to harm to
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FTC does vote to file the suit, it would be referred to
an administrative law judge at the agency, who would hold a trial.
If the judge ruled against Intel, the company could appeal back to
the commissioners. If the FTC turned down such an appeal, then the
company could take its case to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   An advantage Intel would hold in this circumstance is that it
could select any appeals court in the country, trying to find a
court it might believe is least sympathetic to FTC cases.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As he will be the first to tell you, Nicholson Baker is
an author of many reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think I'm a weird nut case with some sort of
strange filing system,'' he said, referring to those readers
puzzled by his minutia-filled mental meanderings in works like
``The Mezzanine'' and his obsessive attention to detail in his
essays on libraries, language and punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are ``the fairly intense `Fermata' people,'' he said,
who love with perhaps too much gusto his novel about a man who
stops time and ogles naked women, and who presume that in the
mild-mannered author they have found a sexual kindred spirit who
gives literary validation to their own X-rated fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Both, and neither, might be true, said the 41-year-old Baker,
stopping in London recently on the occasion of the publication of
his latest book, ``The Everlasting Story of Nory,'' yet another
departure.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, which describes the relatively uneventful life of an
imaginative 9-year-old American girl spending a year in England,
represents another facet of what Baker hopes is a multifaceted
writerly personality, one that has produced novels, nonfiction
books and essays on such diverse subjects as the author's obsession
with the writer John Updike and the origins of the word ``lumber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every book I've written I've tried to make very different from
the one before,'' he said. ``I'd like to have all my books make the
same point _ and it's kind of a stupid point, really _ that a
single human being can think about a lot of different things. There
can be nerdy parts and sordid parts and, with some luck, noble
parts and morally nuanced parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every human being has a lot of different moods, and I would
rather it would be evidence not of my being this weird, fragmented
personality, but of the fact that all these things are part of one
fairly normal self.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed at his hotel here, Baker appeared fairly normal. He
wears preppy clothes: on this occasion, a pair of khakis, a white
shirt and a striped tie and tiny-checked jacket. He orders a Caesar
salad but fails to eat much of it, and speaks in a low and calm
voice. He exhibits the kind of affection toward words that you
might expect from a man who, speaking at his sister's wedding in
1987, said, ``These are excellent words, `husband' and `wife'; they
lean toward each other; they exist in reference to each other; they
link arms.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its divergences from his earlier work, ``Nory'' has the
hallmarks of a classic Baker project: the pointillistic accretion
of detail, the loving use of language, the tendency to go off on
long, serpentine tangents that reflect the author's catholic and
often abstruse interests. Baker is a man who loves doing research,
who loves immersing himself in his subjects and who says he is
``interested in anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Baker says he didn't want to ``sound like I was doing
some sort of home movie,'' he modeled the protagonist of ``Nory''
almost precisely on his own daughter, Alice, who was 9 when he
wrote the book during a year in which the Baker family moved from
Berkeley, Calif., to live in the English cathedral town of Ely.
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of details have been changed _ ``I've never
liked books that pretend to be nonfiction but aren't,'' Baker said
_ many of the fanciful stories Nory tells, many of the words she
uses and many of the things that happen to her are direct from
Alice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice was telling these stories to herself, and she got this
kind of panicky feeling that she wasn't going to remember them,''
Baker said. He got a kind of panicky feeling, too. ``I knew that
I'd already lost this person who was 6, as she evolved into this
person who was 8. Some of the ways she spoke _ odd little phrases
and things _ persisted, but they were going, and I knew that if I
waited, they would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a deadline, if I was ever going to fix a point in which
I could remember her as a child, to catch a whole self in a book.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he always does, Baker embarked on a period of research,
except that this time he interviewed his daughter, immersing
himself in her vocabulary, mental processes, moral framework and
daily life. The book is peppered with Alice's made-up stories,
which capture precisely a child's dark imagination, and flights of
fancy that may be hers or may be her father's. In one passage, Nory
considers the meaning of ``fatal flaw,'' which leads her to think
about ``the last straw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last straw was the straw that broke the camel's back,''
she thinks. ``The last straw was not, repeat not, the last straw in
the machine at a restaurant that when it was taken meant the
machine was empty and you would have to drink your milk shake sadly
without a straw. Kids find out rather quickly that it is less fun
to drink the normal way, with your mouth, because with a straw it's
as if you have magical powers and are telling the drink, `Kazam,
kazaw, now climb the straw!'''
</P>
<P>
   While he let some of his own self slip into the book, Baker did
not draw on his own childhood, a time in which, he said, ``I was
interested in very complicated parking garages.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things he most enjoyed, he said, was recording a
child's tendencies to misspeak, to use malapropisms or
idiosyncratic language. Nory uses the word ``heroine'' for hero,
describes something as being ``not up to sniff,'' and says
``heroriously'' as a kind of cross between ``uproariously'' and
``hysterically.'' These are Alice's mistakes, too, and her father
delights in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad when a certain kind of misunderstanding goes
away,'' he said. ``I wanted to be sure to have those in place for
ready reference, but also I'd always liked inventing new words or
coming up with ways in which the language would track reality in a
new way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for writing this book now, he said, is that
he wanted to move past the unwelcome reputation as a purveyor of
high-concept pornography that he seems to have picked up after the
publication of his last two novels. In addition to ``The Fermata,''
which many reviewers found distasteful, there was ``Vox,'' which is
a much more likable book but is essentially about two people having
phone sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vox'' was catapulted into public consciousness lately when it
emerged that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, had
subpoenaed Monica Lewinsky's book-purchasing records and that one
of the books she had reportedly bought _ although this has never
been verified _ was ``Vox.'' The implication was that she might
have given it to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he was livid about what he called Starr's ``crude use
of our brilliantly adaptable legal system.'' He continued: ```Vox'
is about two people maintaining their privacy and only revealing
what they choose to reveal by telling each other stories. It was an
odd thing to have that book be used to invade someone's privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's delightful that somebody buys the book and gives it to
somebody else, and if the other person happens to be the president,
that's fine,'' he said. But he would like to dissociate himself
gently from ``Vox'' and ``The Fermata.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling about those books is that I'm very glad they were
written,'' he said. ``I did my best with them and felt they had to
be written, but I wish that I hadn't written them, that I could now
detach my own self from these books. They created a set of
expectations I can't fulfill, and they alienated people. From my
point of view as a father, I have to write as many books as
possible, so books like `Vox' and `The Fermata' get lost in the
shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Everlasting Story of Nory'' has drawn mixed reviews, with
some reviewers accusing Baker of writing a plotless, meandering
book and others saying it represents a return to classic Baker
form. Baker has been used to that, ever since one of the earliest
reviews for ``The Mezzanine,'' slammed his ``molassian streams of
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are ecstatic, saying the book is amazing and new,
and others saying: `What was he thinking? This is so bad,''' he
said of his reviews. ``Any recent bad review annihilates all other
bad reviews.'' But when a book works best, he added, ``it has lots
of instructional surprises, and it has human truths, and there's
love in it.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I feel I've finally done a book that I'm proud
of. I was finally able to get down on the page the reason why a
parent could love a kid.''

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neal Shapiro does not own one of the biggest homes in Beverly
Hills; nor has he found work for Farrah Fawcett, Joan Collins or
Heather Locklear, and his production company has never been traded
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But check out the fall prime-time television schedule: Neal
Shapiro is currently the closest thing in the business to Aaron
Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling, producer of such fare as ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``The
Love Boat'' and ``Fantasy Island,'' once controlled seven hours of
ABC's schedule. In the fall, Neal Shapiro, executive producer of
``Dateline NBC,'' will be in charge of five hours of NBC's schedule
_ all ``Datelines.''
</P>
<P>
   That news magazine program has become the most pervasive
generator of ratings on the hit-laden NBC schedule, having grown
from one struggling hour in 1993, Shapiro's first year at NBC, to
four hit hours this last season.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to network television's inveterate penchant for imitating
success, ``Dateline'' is also remaking the landscape of prime time,
as recent events demonstrate. ABC has reconstituted its three news
magazines under the single title of ``20/20'' and hopes to extend
that franchise to other nights. And CBS executives continue to
ponder the option of adding a second weekly edition to the gold
standard of the genre, CBS News' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Shapiro's guiding hand _ and not always to the delight of
media critics _ ``Dateline'' has rewritten the rules of the news
magazine show. Among the touches ``Dateline'' has added to the
format: blanket coverage of breaking stories in the news, like the
O.J. Simpson trial; expanded single-hour coverage of stories, like
the fate of an entire Bedford-Stuyvesant fourth-grade class from
the 1980s, and short regular features like ``Time and Again,''
which quizzes viewers on what year certain events took place.
</P>
<P>
   As its success has grown, ``Dateline NBC'' has also reshaped how
entertainment executives view news magazines. They once considered
them a news division nuisance, which interfered with their
entertainment feifs. Now they increasingly see the news magazine as
a highly useful, multinight franchise that can ease the pressure to
fill 22 hours with more expensive entertainment shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the NBC News magazine program has become the
target of frequent critical attacks for focusing more on ratings
than news value, for bending too much toward tabloid-style stories
like the Simpson trial and the JonBenet Ramsey murder and for
opening the door to influence from the entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, the producer who invented the news magazine with
``60 Minutes,'' has said of the plan to expand his program, ``Do
you want a second edition of `60 Minutes' or do you want `Dateline'
with the name `60 Minutes' on it?'' He said that ``Dateline''
reminded him of ``the Dole pineapple family that went to Hawaii as
missionaries; they went to do good, and they did well; `Dateline'
is doing very well for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The man at the center of this programming revolution and
journalism debate is a softspoken, 40-year-old news producer, who
once thought having even two news magazines was a daunting
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had the one show, I thought, `no one had ever done two
_ I wonder if I can do it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought he could not, including a friend from the
ABC News magazine program ``Prime Time Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me; `This will never work. You can't do two shows
as well as one. You'll never find enough people. There's no way to
find enough stories to be on twice a week. You'll crash and
burn,''' Shapiro recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Shapiro said, ``Going to two turned out OK;
two to three wasn't that hard; three to four was little more
demanding, but news is our friend.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical week of ``Dateline'' shows, like last week, includes
interviews (the actor Harrison Ford, the former football player and
convicted gambler Art Schlichter), an investigative piece (an
examination of accusations of sexual harassment at Ford Motor Co.),
a light story (the conflict between two office workers over the
$100,000 prize from a Pepsi bottle) and an update of a continuing
story (a look at the Ramsey case).
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said one main element of the success of Dateline had
been its willingness to drop everything and chase like a thundering
herd after whatever story is driving daily coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the number of stories ``Dateline'' did on the
Simpson case, Shapiro said, ``I have no idea _ dozens and dozens.''
It was the same after the death of Diana, Princes of Wales. But
Shapiro notes that many of these stories provided information not
found anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Using a newspaper term, Shapiro said that ``Dateline''
aggressively ``seeks out sidebars, millions and millions of
sidebars'' to stories in the news. ``We do stories on the things
people are talking about,'' he said. ``The stories that are in the
public consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach has led to the most consistent criticism of
``Dateline:'' that the show builds its big audiences by pandering
to popular taste.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is more thoughtful than outraged about this suggestion.
``People say I'm cynical and I'm just trying to get the audience
in. Is there an element of that? Yeah. But along the way I give
them a good story and they come away saying, `I didn't know
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the charge that the show is filled with soft features and
tabloid-style stories, Shapiro said, ``I think that's a little
loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, there are some things that are perfectly legitimate and
appropriate to do, and I'm kind of puzzled why some things are OK
in the printed world, but not on television,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that print magazines frequently do featurey reports in
the backs of their books, not unlike ``Dateline'' features like
``Discoveries,'' which has chronicled such developments as a man
who invented a pizza box that will not collapse.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The viewer-friendly touches have made it easier, Shapiro said,
to attract an audience for extended reports on topics that only
``Dateline'' could have developed into attention-getting reports.
He cited a full-hour show about layoffs at AT&AMP;T that followed three
employees for a year after they had been dismissed and a report
that used a hidden camera to document the prejudice that the
disabled face in finding a job, getting an apartment and getting a
seat in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's most pointed defense of the quality of journalism at
``Dateline'' is a simple enumeration of awards the show has piled
up: three Emmy awards this last year; eight the year before; nine
National Headliner Awards; a Robert Kennedy Journalism Award, and a
DuPont Silver Baton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about `Dateline' is we're always trying to
redefine the genre,'' Shapiro said. ```60 Minutes,' because of its
tradition, for so long defined the news magazine as three pieces
and Andy Rooney. What's lost is when Don Hewitt started, he was the
pioneer. He was this aggressive young guy, and the traditionalists
who did documentaries said: `What is he doing? Documentaries need
to be an hour. You can't do three in an hour. What are these ambush
interviews that he's doing? It's outrageous.' Don has been an
incredible pioneer, but that doesn't mean it should stop there.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Dateline'' under Shapiro is all the more
remarkable because the show came so close to extinction _
self-immolation, really _ in 1993 when, under a previous producer,
it rigged up an explosion of a General Motors vehicle for a report
on truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in an abject apology, the departure of the
previous producer, Jeff Diamond, and the resignation of the
president of NBC News, Michael Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew Lack, the new president of NBC News, arrived, he
said he had found ``a place in shambles.'' He had never met
Shapiro, who was thrust into an effort to salvage ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro had been recruited from ABC, where he was the broadcast
producer for ``Prime Time Live.'' (In 1992 he won a George Polk
Award for foreign reporting.) A native of Albany, N.Y., Shapiro
began his journalism career as a part-time newspaper correspondent
before moving to television. He had numerous assignments at ABC
News including stints producing for ``Nightline'' and ``World News
Tonight.'' He is married to the ABC correspondent JuJu Chang.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro rather quickly moved ``Dateline'' past its truck-story
humiliation, helping to encourage Lack to pursue his conviction
that a single news magazine could broadcast multiple versions each
week.
</P>
<P>
   Now Shapiro is managing a machine that churns out 600 to 800
stories a year. About 200 stories are in some stage of production
at all times. The show's staff, about 80 in 1993, will reach 320
when the fifth edition begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs of adding a new edition of ``Dateline'' are less
than they would be with a new magazine show, or a drama. ``There
are all sorts of economies of scale,'' Shapiro said. Among the
biggest: The two anchors, Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips, work
every edition.
</P>
<P>
   News magazines cost about two-thirds of the $1.2 million average
for a drama. But they stay in production all summer, which pushes
up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Advertiser support is especially good for ``Dateline'' because
the show attracts the young adult urban viewers most favored by
advertisers. Two editions, Tuesday and Monday, are among the 15
top-rated shows on television. The Friday edition wins its time
period most weeks, and ratings have grown for the Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, who heads NBC's entertainment division, said:
``There is no show more important to us than `Dateline.' I look on
`Dateline' as a hit show the same way I look on `E.R.' as a hit
show.''
</P>
<P>
   From Shapiro's point of view, ``Dateline'' also provides all the
drama any viewer could want. The ideal ``Dateline'' story, he said,
should have ``a good character in conflict over something. That's
the essence of what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro clearly has a feel for keeping audiences in their seats
_ and one reason, said one senior NBC executive, has been his
willingness to listen to programming advice from the entertainment
division.
</P>
<P>
   The executive said Shapiro had reserved some especially potent
stories for sweep rating months and has occasionally moved stories
around depending on what audience he was told was likely to be
available. Monday, for example, is the night for stories tailored
to female viewers because the show follows a lineup of comedies
aimed at women and competes with football on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said he never had made any decision based on advice from
NBC entertainment executives. ``I do the stories I want to do. I've
never been told what to do. I tell them what I'm doing,'' he said.
``They'll call and say about a certain story: `That was a great
piece, we need more like that.' They may take that as instruction.
I consider it an attaboy.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of adding one more night to his already busy week
does not seem to faze Shapiro. ``I never say no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, if other magazines copy us, or `60 Minutes,'
I don't care. If our contribution is saying we put the news back
into the news magazine, I'm delighted about that.''

MOYA DOMINATES CORRETJA TO TAKE FRENCH OPEN CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Carlos Moya flopped down, flat on his back and
vulnerable for the first time after playing the leading man in a
2-hour, 18-minute performance. It was a 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 mauling of
his outclassed friend and opponent, Alex Corretja, that proclaimed
Moya, the flashy bandanna-clad Spaniard, the latest French Open
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's defeat of
Monica Seles in the women's final on Saturday, Moya put the
finishing touches on a Spanish sweep of this Grand Slam event's
singles titles on Sunday, a coup that last occurred when Sanchez
Vicario and Sergi Bruguera monopolized the event in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot explain with words how happy I am,'' said Moya, the
young man from Majorca, who improved his ranking to fifth in the
world. Moya recalled coveting this title since he saw Bruguera
pocket the first of his back-to-back French Open championships in
1993. ``When he was handed the trophy, I was wondering, you know,
how I'd love to be there,'' Moya said. ``It was like jealous, but
in a good way. And five, six years later, I'm here in his place. So
as I said before, I don't have any way to describe this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did have a novel way of reacting to it.
</P>
<P>
   Having just captured his first Grand Slam event championship in
the second all-Spanish finale here, the 21-year-old Moya did what
came naturally: he lay down on the clay that had served him so well
for the past two weeks, did a shocked little shimmy, and made a
rust-colored snow angel on center court at windblown Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment you're thinking about all the people who helped
you since I was a little kid, all the people who trust you in the
bad moments,'' said Moya, whose parents brought a 20-member
cheering section from Majorca. ``This victory is for all these
people, especially for my parents, my family, my coach.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 12th-seeded Moya, who rehearsed for Sunday's
manifesto by coming out of nowhere to reach the 1996 Australian
Open final, was done playing in the dirt, the 14th-seeded Corretja
had vaulted over the net and was waiting to hug him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw how happy he was, I was happy for him,'' Corretja
said. That is not unusual for the Spanish men: Here in Paris, Moya
and Corretja were part of a posse of 19 Spanish men who wined and
dined together, and the 24-year-old Corretja said they fully
intended to celebrate together Sunday night. ``Maybe if I lost to
another guy I would not feel like this, but as I said before, even
if I win or if I lose, I'm happy. I think we should make a big
party, because this is not normal,'' he said of Spain's domination
here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The diplomatic Corretja, a player best known for double-faulting
at match point of his 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinal against a
retching, cramping Pete Sampras, also pointed out the sportsmanship
he and his compatriot displayed Sunday. There was not a line
dispute in the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for us both, but we tried to be professional
about it,'' he said. ``But we didn't need the chair umpire or the
linesmen because every time we were giving the balls to each other.
Next time we meet, we just play by ourselves because I just trust
him. I never check the mark. He never check the mark with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Together again on the presentation podium, Moya and Corretja
clowned around with Pele, who geared up for his VIP duties at the
World Cup soccer festivities by helping to hand out the trophies.
Once the formalities were completed, Pele handed each tennis player
a soccer ball and grabbed Moya's trophy for himself before being
enticed into some soccer gambits.
</P>
<P>
   First Moya, and then Corretja, headed the ball back-and-forth
with their idol, but they found no success when they tried to coax
the secret behind his soccer prowess out of him, not with Spain and
Brazil about to get their World Cup campaigns under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extra motivation to win,'' Moya said, joking, ``because
I knew he gave the trophy to the winner. He's been the greatest
ever soccer player.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya put himself in the proper frame of mind for fighting for
this title by choosing to receive and then immediately breaking
Corretja, who played a nervous opening set and never quite found
his bearings for the rest of the match. Corretja could not keep his
groundstrokes sufficiently on the mark to prevent Moya, whose
forehand is as oversized as his baggy NBA-style shorts, from
running around his backhand and thwacking out forehand winners.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja converted only two of nine break chances, no contest
against Moya's 6-for-19 conversion rate. Moya, the more versatile
of the two, won 18 of his 107 points at the net, served five aces
and kept his performance free of double-faults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't handle the wind,'' Corretja said. ``I was the whole
time trying to find the ball. He played much better than me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Moya received his championship trophy, called the
Mousquetaires Cup, from Don Budge, who in 1938 became the first
player in the sport's history to win all four Grand Slam events in
a calendar year and earn the Grand Slam of tennis. ... In the
women's doubles final, second-seeded Martina Hingis and Jana
Novotna defeated top-seeded Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva
6-1, 7-6 (7-4). In the men's doubles final, which was postponed by
rain on Saturday, top-seeded Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis fended
off unseeded Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The expense of producing new full-evening story
ballets these days has nearly guaranteed the demise of the genre.
But American Ballet Theater persists. On Friday night, the company
presented the much-anticipated New York premiere of ``The Snow
Maiden'' at the Metropolitan Opera House. Was the lavish $1.2
million production worth the gamble? The answer is a slightly
qualified yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Snow Maiden'' looks spectacular, a thing of shimmering ice
palaces and exquisite costumes, designed by Desmond Heeley. There
was accomplished and persuasive dancing from two casts of dancers,
on Friday and Saturday nights. And at the ballet's heart, there is
a haunting and provocative tale that has been imaginatively
realized in the choreography of Ben Stevenson, the artistic
director of the Houston Ballet, which produced ``The Snow Maiden''
with Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson drew his plot from Aleksandr Ostrovsky's
``Snegurochka'' (``The Snow Maiden''), an 1873 play based on Slavic
folk stories, with incidental music by Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Though the play was unsuccessful, Ostrovsky's story was reborn
in the Rimsky-Korsakov opera of the same name and in subsequent
ballet versions. This production is set to music by Tchaikovsky,
assembled by John Lanchbery from the Ostrovsky original and a wide
variety of other unnamed scores.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to understand the lure of the story, given a
central character with the tantalizing pathos of the doomed and
dooming sylphs and maidens who populate the 19th-century ballet
classics.
</P>
<P>
   Here, that character is a beautiful, childlike woman made of
snow and ice who has the misfortune to fall in love with a man and
who melts to a wisp of dress at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Stevenson decided to create this version while
working on a ballet production of ``Peer Gynt'' three years ago.
This ``Snow Maiden'' is ballet as Ibsen might have choreographed
it, a story of dashed idealism and love and faithless society that
is more searingly dark than the grimmest of fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   For all the lilting snow maidens, leaping reindeer and cavorting
villagers, it is an intimate story. And it is in the ballet's most
intimate moments that Stevenson's creation comes most fully and
fascinatingly alive.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments include pas de deux and solos danced by the Snow
Maiden, by Misgir, with whom she falls in love, and by Coupava, his
fiancee. The repeated furlings and circlings of the wedding pas de
deux suggest, for example, the orderly, cozy, loving world Misgir
and Coupava have made for themselves. The final pas de deux is
harrowing, with the Snow Maiden's drooping, falling body clinging
to Misgir as she melts.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Ananiashvili, who danced the title role in Houston and on
Friday at the Met, was a figure of poignant loneliness, her
fluttering hands and childlike playfulness recalling Carla Fracci
as August Bournonville's Sylph and the long, tapering line of her
body suggesting hope.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Kent's Snow Maiden, on Saturday, was a metaphor for light
and ice, an effect enhanced by Duane Schuler's magical lighting.
Ms. Kent's maiden came closest to human frailty as she hurtled
excitedly off into another world in a silver sled.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has given his lead characters the kind of acutely
observed specific qualities that are seldom seen in ballet. Misgir,
in varying degrees, is not entirely smitten with the maiden. He is
not the lost, dreaming poet hero of Romantic ballet but a sturdy,
kind-hearted peasant who soars and spins like the nobleman
Stevenson has made him, at least as portrayed by Angel Corella on
Friday and a heart-rending Guillaume Graffin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Coupava, as played by Kathleen Moore on Friday, is a bit of a
scold with the upper hand in this relationship, turning lyrical in
the pas de deux and her central solo. Ashley Tuttle, replacing an
injured Martha Butler on Saturday, made Coupava's determination and
happiness evident through her dancing alone, without much effort at
acting.
</P>
<P>
   Father Frost, brilliantly performed by Victor Barbee on Friday
and Michael Owen on Saturday, spends a lot of time falling and
sitting on the ice, establishing his forest people's affinity for
their chill world. He scrambles tellingly across the ice on all
fours, giddy at first and later fearful as he sees his beloved
daughter race off to annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   The production's great problem is the length and tedium of its
group and ensemble dances and the Snow Maiden's opening solo.
Unlike the divertissements and group dances of late-19th-century
story ballets, on which this ``Snow Maiden'' is modeled, they
seldom advance the plot or suggest anything about classical ballet
itself. Like some of the Tchaikovsky score, they are numbingly
incidental-feeling, with folk accents that look like the threadbare
ballet conventions they have become. ``The Snow Maiden'' cries out
for editing.
</P>
<P>
   But the dancing was of a high order in a lead cast completed by
Joaquin de Luz, John Selya and Sascha Radetsky as the village's
bounding drunks, and Christina Fagundes, Veronica Lynn, Ekaterina
Shelkanova, Maxim Belotserkovsky (on Friday), Parrish Maynard (on
Saturday), Giuseppe Picone and Keith Roberts as Misgir's friends.
Irina Kolpakova, a company coach, was quietly spectacular as the
Czarina, amusing casting given Ms. Kolpakova's former prominence as
a Soviet ballerina. Hiller Huhn assisted Stevenson in setting the
production.

   TROPOJE, Albania _ A local gun merchant, his handkerchief
hanging out of his green camouflage cap to keep his neck from
roasting in the afternoon sun, reached into the trunk of an old
black Audi where he had a pile of assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big boom,'' he said in broken English, picking up a
Chinese-made AK-47 rifle. ``Ten dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million people, has begun
with the mixture of farce and tragedy that colored the recent wars
in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Men and boys woefully unschooled in the mechanics of war swagger
about in uniforms, aping the macho warriors in the fantasy world of
television and film. Most appear doomed to walk into a conflict
they do not understand, where chaos, violence and mayhem take the
place of rules of engagement and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many groups that have formed to fight,'' said
a senior Albanian official who expressed dismay at the number of
fighters. ``They have no coordination, little experience and no
idea of what awaits them. Many will die very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that many are dying already. The rebels who
escort refugees from Kosovo across the border into Albania boast
proudly that they are holding a stretch of road near Pec against
Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But none are able to explain why dying for this piece of asphalt
advances the rebel cause. Other armed groups have apparently dug
trenches around besieged towns and are trying to fight off superior
Serbian forces, which on Saturday used jet fighters to bomb
suspected rebel positions, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you the name of my village because we have
strong resistance there,'' a 23-year-old man said. ``We will go
back tonight to help hold off the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The open-air gun market in this dusty, lawless border town is
the last stop in Albania for many of the mercenaries, smugglers and
idealistic volunteers who are headed by foot into Kosovo to join
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Mules loaded down with weapons brayed in the dusty streets, and
ancient machine guns, some from World War II, lay in rows against
the barbed wire fences. A half-dozen merchants, all with assault
rifles slung over their shoulders, turned the weapons over for
inspection, many to men who seemed unsure how to handle them. One
man was selling a collection of green anti-tank mines.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers rammed home ammunition and fired bursts into the
woods to try out the guns. Groups of men, conspicuous in new
camouflage fatigues, cartridge belts and black combat boots, lay
stretched out on a grassy slope for the signal to begin the 15-hour
climb over the Shkelzen Mountains into Kosovo with the departing
mule trains. Many others wandered aimlessly up and down the dirt
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here all day,'' a young fighter said. ``Tonight I
will go into the mountains with 40 others. We will be home by
tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the dusty square, surrounded by windowless, crumbling
concrete buildings and collapsing mud and wattle homes, several
dozen men were crammed into a noisy, fetid bar. They swiftly downed
brown bottles of beer, talked of the coming battle and tried to
mask their nervousness with an unconvincing bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will all fight to the death,'' said a heavy-set man wearing
a shiny leather case that held a huge hunting knife. ``Every
Albanian in Kosovo is now a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Serbia, in defiance of international calls for restraint in
Kosovo, has been shelling and burning towns along the Albanian
border for over a week, apparently to create a depopulated buffer
zone. The attack is expected to displace as many as 40,000 people,
nearly 20,000 of whom have now fled to Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs apparently hope to use the free-fire zone to block the
flow of weapons and fighters that have poured into Kosovo since
Serbia began its campaign against the rebels in March. Several
hundred people have been killed in the three months of fighting.
</P>

   The Albanian border region is flooded with volunteers and arms
dealers, many of whom sell some of the 650,000 weapons looted from
Albanian armories last year. Mule trains, laden with guns and green
ammunition boxes, wind up the steep slopes into Kosovo; the border
towns are awash in men waiting to depart.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian guard towers on the border were silhouetted on the
sharp, forested ridge above Tropoje as the groups of rebels bought
up weapons and prepared to leave Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The preparation has deeply disturbed relief workers, who have
been placing refugees in local homes and struggling to bring in
tons of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Serbs decide to drop a few shells over the border,'' a
relief official said, ``the first place they will land will be
Tropoje. This place has become a base camp.''

TELEMEDICINE GETTING TEST IN EFFORTS TO CUT COSTS OF TREATING
PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Iowa, Kan., Mass., Texas, Va.)  (bb) 
 By KATE MURPHY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Universal health care is a reality in one part of the United
States: prison.
</P>
<P>
   By law, inmates are guaranteed medical treatment. And with the
ranks of prisoners rising an average of 8 percent every year since
1990, providing that treatment is an expensive proposition.
</P>
<P>
   To control costs and improve security, a handful of states are
trying out telemedicine _ health care via telecommunications. With
government agencies, managed-care providers and legislators
watching, these programs are serving as a proving grounds for
broadening the use of telemedicine.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of limited acceptance as a way to provide
health care to people in areas where there are few doctors,
telemedicine has been embraced by prison officials as a way to
minimize the costs and dangers of transporting inmates to hospitals
when they need advanced or specialty care.
</P>
<P>
   Most prisons are in rural areas, requiring inmates to travel
hours, shackled and under guard, to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``With telemedicine, prisoners don't even have to leave their
cellblock,'' said Dr. Steven Viegas, a hand surgeon who oversees
the prison telemedicine project at the University of Texas Medical
Branch at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1994 and covering roughly 100,000 inmates in 12
prisons, the University of Texas telemedicine program is the
nation's oldest and largest. Yearly, the online network saves about
$300,000 in prisoner transportation costs alone.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons generally have infirmaries operated by primary-care
doctors or nurses. When an inmate needs more than rudimentary care,
the jail's medical personnel use specialized equipment _ like
electronic stethoscopes and otoscopes _ to transmit real-time audio
and high-resolution video images of prisoners to physicians at
hospitals hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Both the off-site doctor and patient have two monitors so they
can see each other as well as their own images.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware costs $60,000 to $100,000 and charges for
high-speed phone lines are around $1,000 to $1,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Although statistics are hard to come by because prison
telemedicine programs are so new and so few, administrators say
their economic benefits go beyond savings in transportation and
security. Anecdotal evidence suggests that inmates are more likely
to seek care when they do not have to travel to see a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lower threshold to getting care probably reduces the
likelihood of more expensive acute care later on,'' said Dr.
Michael Kienzle, associate dean for clinical affairs at the
University of Iowa Hospital in Iowa City, which last year began to
extend electronic health care to 4,000 inmates in four state
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Telemedicine also streamlines the delivery of specialty care.
For example, the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center in
Charlottesville schedules weekly online clinics for jail inmates in
such medical specialties as dermatology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specialist sits at a computer and sees patients from
different units all across the state, one after another,'' said
Richard Settimo, deputy director of the University of Virginia's
office of telemedicine, which opened last year to serve 5,000
inmates in five state prisons. ``The ability to block-schedule
prisoners saves a whole lot of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-site medical staff follows the treatment recommendations
of the specialist. If the treatment is complicated, the prisoner is
then transported to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency of prison programs has not escaped the attention
of public and private interests responsible for providing health
care to people who are not behind bars. Based on its success in
treating prisoners, the University of Virginia received a grant
from the Commerce Department in October to set up a $1.2 million
telemedicine network to serve Medicaid patients in the state's
rural southwestern region.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the University of Iowa's prison project led to a
joint venture with a private managed-care company, Help Innovations
Inc. of Lawrence, Kan., to provide home health care using
telemedicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to point to our experience in the prisons as
evidence of the effectiveness of telemedicine,'' Kienzle said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two managed-care companies _ Partners Health Care System Inc.,
based in Boston, and Kaiser Permanente, based in Sacramento, Calif.
_ had prison programs in mind when they recently established
telemedicine networks as an inexpensive way to serve isolated,
homebound elderly and chronically ill subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew of the effectiveness of prison care systems and used
them as a basis for carving out our own application,'' said Eric
Menn, corporate manager of Partners' telemedicine division.
</P>
<P>
   The military uses telemedicine, as well. For example, the United
States Army has a $30 million system in place in Bosnia, linking
the medical staff there to physicians at military bases around the
world. Its benefits are aimed less at controlling costs than at
keeping doctors out of harm's way, though.
</P>
<P>
   The prison telemedicine systems have provided arguments for
reimbursing the expenses of telemedicine when it is used to care
for the general population. Currently, telemedicine is generally
not covered by Medicare or private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from prison administrators before a Senate ad hoc
committee on telemedicine led to the inclusion of a provision in
last year's Balanced Budget Act that will require Medicare to pay
for telemedicine delivered to certain rural areas found to have a
shortage of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision makers have definitely been watching what's going
on in the prisons,'' said Deborah Dakins, editor of Telemedicine
and Telehealth Networks, a bimonthly magazine that tracks the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Positive preliminary results from these ``test cases'' have
modestly increased access to telemedicine in both the public and
private health care sectors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more time and more data before it is
commonplace for patients outside prison to stick out their tongues
and say ``ahhhh'' for a computer.

AMERICANS TURNING AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans looked at life insurance for generations as a
cornerstone of their family finances, as crucial as a home mortgage
or savings for college.
</P>
<P>
   But as people have begun to live longer and worry more about
running out of money in retirement, millions of Americans have
started either to do without life insurance or buy less. Instead,
they have been pouring money into investments like mutual funds and
variable annuities, which they hope will take them comfortably
through their golden years.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in attitudes, which has been building gradually for
years, has now reached a critical mass, sending life insurance
sales into something of a free fall and radically changing how
insurance companies do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers are hitting their 50s and, as always, they
think they are going to live forever,'' said Michael Weiss, an
author and marketing analyst who has written about consumer
lifestyles. ``Because they don't trust Social Security or Medicare
being around, they really feel they have to plan financially for
their future. And they're going for the best return they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young people have also gotten caught up in what financial
specialists call ``wealth accumulation,'' pumping spare money into
401(k) and other retirement plans _ hoping, effectively, to
self-insure against any catastrophe. Fifteen years ago, Americans
bought 17.7 million new policies; last year, they bought 11.1
million, a 37 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   The change, industry experts say, is being driven by several
trends that reflect the hybrid nature of life insurance, which not
only can provide financial protection for survivors but also serve
as a vehicle for saving.
</P>
<P>
   More and more people are deciding that insurance is simply not a
good investment. A growing number of people are concluding that
financial protection can best be achieved with an inexpensive term
policy. And in an age of two-income families, still others are
determining that protection is less necessary because they have the
means to look after themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All of these trends have combined to cut sharply into the sale
of traditional whole-life insurance, or so-called permanent life
policies, which have fulfilled both the investment and protection
functions and long served as the industry's most profitable
product.
</P>
<P>
   The sales decline has become deep enough to transform the
insurance business and to play a key role in the recent wave of
mergers sweeping the industry. Many insurers are now focused on
selling investment products and financial advice, and some have
gone so far as to drop life insurance from their names. One
company, Sun America Inc., which used to be known as Sun Life
Insurance Co. of America, now offers no death benefits at all
except in conjunction with mutual funds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the insurance industry argues that traditional
coverage remains as valuable as ever. ``Our lives have a way of
taking unexpected turns,'' said John Dolan, a spokesman for the
American Council of Life Insurance, a trade group in Washington,
``and permanent life insurance provides a long-term safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, plenty of insurance is still being sold.
Middle-class Americans with young children and mortgages continue
to be regular customers, although often buying much less coverage
than their parents. Big policies, those with a face value of
hundreds of thousands of dollars and up, are selling briskly,
providing protection for the affluent against estate taxes. And the
number of new term policies is rising as premiums continue to fall
for this basic coverage, which provides protection for a specified
period and has no saving feature. As a result, the total face value
of new policies of all kinds is up.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, less than half of all American households now have
life insurance beyond the often minimal coverage provided by
employers, according to an estimate by A.M. Best &AMP; Co., an
insurance ratings agency. That compares with nearly three-quarters
of the households in the 1960s, says another industry group, the
Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association, known as LIMRA.
</P>
<P>
   While a decision to go without insurance, or with less coverage,
would have been seen as highly imprudent not long ago, it is now
increasingly viewed as the sensible thing to do, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people have become better informed, they have found that
the life insurance policy was not a very good way to save money,
particularly in the current bull market,'' said Roy DiLiberto, a
financial planner and former insurance agent in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Whole life includes an investment feature that typically pays
just 4 percent to 5 percent annually. For years, financial planners
have urged clients to buy much cheaper term coverage and put the
savings in premiums into mutual funds or individual stocks. Last
year, a third of all new policies were term, up from 23 percent in
1994, according to LIMRA.
</P>
<P>
   But big demographic changes are also at work. The nature of the
American household has changed substantially and with it the need
for financial protection.
</P>
<P>
   People are marrying and starting families later and now often
buy their first life insurance in their 30s rather than in their
20s. And, increasingly, they are abandoning their policies as they
move into their 50s and 60s, pay off their mortgages and see their
children graduate from college. These shifts have added to the
popularity of term life policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the rise of the two-income family has made some people
question the need even for term coverage. Many two-income couples
without children and with little debt have calculated that the loss
of one income would not be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the Ozzie-and-Harriet world of working dad and
stay-at-home mom may have needed life insurance,'' said Rick
Adkins, a former insurance agent who is now a co-owner of Arkansas
Financial Group, a financial planning firm in Little Rock, Ark.
``But with dual working couples, many are making the rational
decision that they don't need the insurance and should be more
invested in the stock market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Edward Miller, chief executive of Equitable Cos., which had its
origins in insurance but now makes most of its money from
investment products and services, says that rising affluence has
changed the nature of the protection many families seek. ``There is
less concern about a financial crisis if something happens to
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More people with lower incomes have also been going without
insurance, analysts say, at least partly because agents, looking
for bigger sales with bigger commissions, have stopped knocking on
their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no agents calling to say, `Let's sit down around
your kitchen table so I can sell you a $30,000 insurance policy,'''
said Mark Trencher, a senior researcher at Conning &AMP; Co., which
specializes in insurance research.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many insurance companies no longer call their
salespeople agents. Instead, they are financial planners, offering
life insurance as only one possibility among an array of mutual
funds and annuities. Since Miller took the helm at the Equitable
eight months ago, he has stepped up efforts to recruit lawyers and
accountants for his sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martindale, a financial planner in San Luis Obispo,
Calif., says that her goal for her clients, most of whom have
household incomes of $70,000 to $80,000, is for them to, in effect,
provide their own insurance. ``The idea,'' she said, ``is to have
enough in investments to take care of the surviving spouse and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young couples will not have enough in savings to do that
immediately, she said. So she tells them to buy term life. Yet many
choose to skimp.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Merrill, a 32-year-old chemical analyst in Austin, Texas,
with a 3-year-old daughter and an infant son, is one example. He
has about $50,000 in term life, or not quite enough to cover a
year's salary _ less than a third of what Ms. Martindale usually
urges. But Merrill said that his wife would soon be returning to an
office job and that he was confident she would be in no danger
financially if he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any fears for her well-being,'' Merrill said,
``because she's as capable as anyone I know in terms of earning a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries him, though, is the distant future. ``We're not
counting on getting anything in retirement from Social Security,''
he said. ``So we're going to have to rely on our investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to cope with the new attitudes, the life insurance
industry has been gradually remaking itself. While the biggest
companies still have millions of life insurance policyholders on
their books, the fastest-growing companies have been emphasizing
the sale of variable annuities, mutual funds and financial advice.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are investments in mutual funds that are
designed to make regular payments in retirement. But they also come
with protection against a market downturn and in that sense
function as something of an insurance substitute. In exchange for
fees that are somewhat higher than a regular mutual fund, an
annuity guarantees that the owner's survivors will receive no less
than the owner's initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most breathtaking revolutions has taken place at Sun
America. In the eight years since it changed its name and sold all
of its traditional life insurance units, the company, with assets
that now exceed $35 billion, has plunged headlong into variable
annuities and mutual funds. For the last decade, its stock has been
one of the best-performing issues on the New York Stock Exchange,
rising an average of 42 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most big insurers, like Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
Metropolitan Life and New York Life and Equitable, still offer a
basket of life insurance choices. But they, too, expect much of
their future growth to come from meeting the investment needs of
the 76 million baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of whole life policies have also suffered because of
lawsuits brought by millions of policyholders who said they were
misled by agents about how much their coverage would actually cost.
Several companies have paid tens of millions of dollars to settle
these suits.
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, life insurance has come to be almost an
afterthought. At Nationwide Life Insurance Co., for example, 90
percent of the revenue last year was from annuities, according to
A.M. Best. That figure included sales of fixed annuities, a less
popular variety that promises to pay a fixed amount of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp-elbowed competition for new _ and different _ business
has driven insurers to cut costs, reorganize operations and look
for merger candidates. Last year, for example, Metropolitan Life
bought a company specializing in 401(k) plans and another that
concentrated on annuities. Some companies, including Prudential,
have been sharpening their focus by selling businesses that do not
fit in with their new profiles as financial services companies. And
a few, like Jefferson Pilot, are actually moving more heavily into
traditional life insurance, betting they will pick up business that
others are eschewing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amid all the movement by consumers from insurance to other
investments, some financial planners are sounding a note of
caution. Permanent life insurance may look like a poor cousin
during a bull market, these planners say, but it will take on a
different aura entirely when the bull turns to a bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people who feel they don't need insurance have
only seen the best part of investing,'' said Richard Hammel, a
planner in Brentwood, Tenn. ``They haven't been through the hard
times.''

   BATTERED-VICTIMS (Los Angeles) _ Waiting to testify as a
reluctant witness in a criminal case, Veronica Martinez spent five
hours in a small holding cell and was led to a courtroom in
handcuffs. She was the victim in a domestic violence case. Her case
represents a trend since the O.J. Simpson trial in which
prosecutors and judges are getting aggressive with victims
themselves. By Alex Roth. (Will move in the ``n'' California and

 UNDATED: stock market.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Miller, chief executive of Equitable Cos., which had its
origins in insurance but now makes most of its money from
investment products and services, says that rising affluence has
changed the nature of the protection many families seek. ``There is
less concern about a financial crisis if something happens to
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More people with lower incomes have also been going without
insurance, analysts say, at least partly because agents, looking
for bigger sales with bigger commissions, have stopped knocking on
their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no agents calling to say, `Let's sit down around
your kitchen table so I can sell you a $30,000 insurance policy,'''
said Mark Trencher, a senior researcher at Conning &AMP; Co., which
specializes in insurance research.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many insurance companies no longer call their
salespeople agents. Instead, they are financial planners, offering
life insurance as only one possibility among an array of mutual
funds and annuities. Since Miller took the helm at the Equitable
eight months ago, he has stepped up efforts to recruit lawyers and
accountants for his sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martindale, a financial planner in San Luis Obispo,
Calif., says that her goal for her clients, most of whom have
household incomes of $70,000 to $80,000, is for them to, in effect,
provide their own insurance. ``The idea,'' she said, ``is to have
enough in investments to take care of the surviving spouse and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young couples will not have enough in savings to do that
immediately, she said. So she tells them to buy term life. Yet many
choose to skimp.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Merrill, a 32-year-old chemical analyst in Austin, Texas,
with a 3-year-old daughter and an infant son, is one example. He
has about $50,000 in term life, or not quite enough to cover a
year's salary _ less than a third of what Ms. Martindale usually
urges. But Merrill said that his wife would soon be returning to an
office job and that he was confident she would be in no danger
financially if he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any fears for her well-being,'' Merrill said,
``because she's as capable as anyone I know in terms of earning a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries him, though, is the distant future. ``We're not
counting on getting anything in retirement from Social Security,''
he said. ``So we're going to have to rely on our investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to cope with the new attitudes, the life insurance
industry has been gradually remaking itself. While the biggest
companies still have millions of life insurance policyholders on
their books, the fastest-growing companies have been emphasizing
the sale of variable annuities, mutual funds and financial advice.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities are investments in mutual funds that are
designed to make regular payments in retirement. But they also come
with protection against a market downturn and in that sense
function as something of an insurance substitute. In exchange for
fees that are somewhat higher than a regular mutual fund, an
annuity guarantees that the owner's survivors will receive no less
than the owner's initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most breathtaking revolutions has taken place at Sun
America. In the eight years since it changed its name and sold all
of its traditional life insurance units, the company, with assets
that now exceed $35 billion, has plunged headlong into variable
annuities and mutual funds. For the last decade, its stock has been
one of the best-performing issues on the New York Stock Exchange,
rising an average of 42 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most big insurers, like Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
Metropolitan Life and New York Life and Equitable, still offer a
basket of life insurance choices. But they, too, expect much of
their future growth to come from meeting the investment needs of
the 76 million baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of whole life policies have also suffered because of
lawsuits brought by millions of policyholders who said they were
misled by agents about how much their coverage would actually cost.
Several companies have paid tens of millions of dollars to settle
these suits.
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, life insurance has come to be almost an
afterthought. At Nationwide Life Insurance Co., for example, 90
percent of the revenue last year was from annuities, according to
A.M. Best. That figure included sales of fixed annuities, a less
popular variety that promises to pay a fixed amount of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp-elbowed competition for new _ and different _ business
has driven insurers to cut costs, reorganize operations and look
for merger candidates. Last year, for example, Metropolitan Life
bought a company specializing in 401(k) plans and another that
concentrated on annuities. Some companies, including Prudential,
have been sharpening their focus by selling businesses that do not
fit in with their new profiles as financial services companies. And
a few, like Jefferson Pilot, are actually moving more heavily into
traditional life insurance, betting they will pick up business that
others are eschewing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amid all the movement by consumers from insurance to other
investments, some financial planners are sounding a note of
caution. Permanent life insurance may look like a poor cousin
during a bull market, these planners say, but it will take on a
different aura entirely when the bull turns to a bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people who feel they don't need insurance have
only seen the best part of investing,'' said Richard Hammel, a
planner in Brentwood, Tenn. ``They haven't been through the hard
times.''

MILOSEVIC AGREES TO LET OBSERVERS INTO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KOSOVO-REBELS.)  
(lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has
agreed to allow diplomatic observers to enter and move through the
province of Kosovo, where Serbian troops and policemen have been
attacking the ethnic Albanian majority, senior administration
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The first observer missions could take place as early as Monday,
the officials said, after weekend negotiations in Belgrade, the
Serbian capital, between Milosevic and the U.S. ambassador to
Macedonia, Christopher Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill will be allowed to escort the chief negotiator for the
ethnic Albanians, Fehmi Agani, and presumably bring journalists
along to view areas where the Serbian military and police have been
operating, the officials said. Milosevic's forces have prevented
foreigners from traveling in Kosovo, Serbia's southernmost
province, and Agani was denied access to those areas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials stressed that the new agreements did not
absolve Milosevic of responsibility for using fear and force to
drive residents from villages along Kosovo's border with Albania,
an operation apparently intended to prevent the infiltration of
arms and new fighters from outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (In Kosovo, members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said
Serbian troops were removing bodies from areas observers might
visit and concealing other evidence of their attacks.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing, whether as a goal or a tactic, is still a
crime,'' a senior U.S. official said. ``We cannot ignore that
extraordinarily grave events occurred last week, and we cannot
allow Milosevic to get a breather because some diplomatic observers
are let in.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said Washington and its allies continued to insist
on the withdrawal of Serbian special police and Yugoslav army units
from Kosovo and on full access for other foreigners. ``Just having
some diplomatic observers who come back and say, `Gosh, this is
terrible and they've destroyed the place,' isn't sufficient,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Milosevic, the former president of
Serbia, has ordered a crackdown against the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and, in particular, against the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting for independence. Western governments do not
support independence for Kosovo, fearing that it would reopen the
Balkan ethnic and religious caldron.
</P>
<P>
   At least 250 people have been killed, 10,000 refugees have fled
into Albania and 50,000 people have been displaced from their
homes, according to an estimate given in London on Sunday by the
British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, but the West has done little
except plan new meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic over the past week has crossed the
threshold,'' said Cook, whose government holds the rotating
presidency of the European Union. ``The use of tanks, of artillery,
of the might of the military army against civilian centers of
population is wholly unacceptable within the modern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Prime Minister Tony Blair have decided to push
Washington and the West ``to a much tougher policy, both
politically and militarily,'' a senior British official said. Blair
told his Cabinet on Thursday that the use of force may be necessary
to get Milosevic to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The British are circulating a draft Security Council resolution
at the United Nations that would authorize NATO to use force ``in
or over Kosovo,'' the official said, a move intended in part to put
pressure on Russia to act more aggressively against its traditional
allies, the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the British are prepared to be out there themselves,''
a senior U.S. official said Sunday. ``I have the feeling they want
to be sure that we're out there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, the British will be host to a European Union foreign
ministers' meeting to press for the imposition of tough economic
sanctions _ especially an investment ban, as well as the more
symbolic freezing of Serbian assets abroad _ that were suspended at
Washington's request when Milosevic agreed to open talks with
Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Those sanctions were never imposed, because Washington used
their suspension as an inducement to Milosevic to open the talks
with Rugova, even though just a week earlier Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright pressed U.S. allies to agree to them.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, too, is now ready to impose those sanctions and to
discuss new ones, U.S. officials said Sunday. They said Milosevic
had used the suspension of sanctions as an excuse to crack down in
Kosovo, embarrassing the Americans and making a further round of
talks with him impossible for Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans insist that dialogue _ together with the pressure
of new sanctions and the ultimate threat of NATO action _ is the
only avenue to a peaceful solution in Kosovo, and that it will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials, both American and European, fear that the
Milosevic crackdown may mean that any opportunity for a solution is
already lost, and that Rugova's credibility has already suffered
too much as the Kosovo Liberation Army gains strength.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Contact Group on the Balkans _ the United States,
Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Russia _ will meet on Wednesday
in Paris at the political director level, and could impose the
suspended sanctions, officials say. The group will meet at the
foreign ministers' level in London on Friday, along with Japan and
Canada, and there is a NATO defense ministers' meeting on Thursday
in Luxembourg, where Kosovo will be a prime topic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has already asked for military options and accelerated
planning for deployments around Kosovo to prevent a possible
regional conflagration. But the British, especially, feel that the
problem is within Kosovo, not around it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Pentagon has made it clear that it does not favor
any new troops to be sent to the Balkans, even as the U.S. forces
in Bosnia and Herzegovina are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   And a U.S. threat to Milosevic of a military response to a
crackdown in Kosovo _ a warning first issued by President George
Bush and repeated by the Clinton administration to Milosevic in
1993 _ remains ``on the table.'' But this threat is ``not now a
topic of real discussion,'' a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. official said that in contrast to Bosnia, where
Washington let the war go on for three years before acting and
involving NATO, the United States has engaged much more rapidly in
Kosovo, even if not quickly enough to satisfy the British.
</P>
<P>
   The push for Milosevic-Rugova talks, backed by sanctions and
then backed by NATO action if the violence continues, is a strategy
that can work, the U.S. official insisted. But as with Bosnia, he
said, there is a great reluctance in the White House ``to move
further into the Balkans, rather than out of it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMPEII, Italy _ There are two Pompeiis near the bay of Naples,
and it is not always clear which is the dead city.
</P>
<P>
   One, crawling with tourists, guides, laborers and archeologists,
hums with activity. The other, where the unemployment rate is 30
percent, has crumbling buildings, faded honty-tonk signs and stray
dogs sleeping in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of the millennium and its attendant religious
celebrations comes the prospect of eight million visitors _ about
evenly divided between pilgrims to a shrine in the modern town and
tourists interested in the ruins. Both Pompeiis are expecting huge
infusions of money for badly needed construction and repair. That
manna from state and private sources could help bridge the
longstanding divide between the two towns. But so far, it has
mainly inflamed old rifts.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two epitomize the paradoxes of Italian life. The
country is increasingly counting on tourism to fuel its economy,
and the Roman ruins of Pompeii _ a frozen glimpse of the country's
long-buried imperial past _ are actually one of the engines of its
future.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the modern town of Pompeii suffers with organized
crime, poverty and unemployment _ all the endemic contemporary
problems that have held southern Italy back and hampered the growth
of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   There is a kind of class warfare between the two. The
prestigious, unique ruins of Pompeii loom above the surrounding
modern sprawl. Beyond its Roman walls, the town of Pompeii, poor,
crime-prone, ugly and studiously avoided by tour groups, simmers
resentfully.
</P>
<P>
   The modern town (population 27,000) has been promised $31
million in state financing to get itself into shape for 2000. Mayor
Sandro Staiano, 43, says that sum is not even close to enough. He
is seeking another $60 million from private investors and views the
millennium boon as his town's last chance for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't build new infrastructure and bring tourists
here,'' he said with a sour smile, ``we'll have another destroyed
Pompeii. Then, visitors will come here and inspect our ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruins of Pompeii, the ancient city wiped out in A.D. 79 by
the eruption at Vesuvius, are Italy's most popular tourist
attraction, visited by two million people a year. (Only the
Vatican, which is technically an independent state, gets more.)
Four million visitors are expected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the site, however promising, is not ready to seize its
moment. Pompeii's ruins are falling further into ruin through
neglect, erosion and vandalism. Much has had to be closed: only 20
villas are now open to the public, down from 64 in 1956. Frescoes
are fading, walls are collapsing and 2,000-year-old floor tiles
unprotected from rain lie jumbled on the ground like Scrabble
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The World Monument Fund and UNESCO both put Pompeii on their
lists of endangered world treasures last year and pledged to help
pay for restoration projects. The Italian government has also
promised $60 million for the site over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   And this, too, is not enough, its caretakers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need $280 million just to protect and restore what we
have,'' said Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, 53, superintendent of the
Pompeii ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 million will be used for restoration and preservation,
not for existing archeological work and new excavations. Nor will
it trickle down to the neighboring town. Guzzo, who was appointed
three years ago, said he was aware of the smoldering rancor of the
town of Pompeii but could do little about it. He has a plan _ not
yet financed _ to build public parks and picnic areas along the
walls to bridge the divide between town and archeological site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that we have to find a way to involve the town more
in what we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The town of Pompeii does have one famous shrine, the Madonna of
Pompeii, which each year attracts more than 1.5 million religious
pilgrims. Four million are expected to journey there in 2000.
Worshipers of the Pompeii Madonna tend to be pious but poor, and
they do not spend much money in the town. Nor do they frequent its
hotels, most of whose 600 beds are rented out by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Tour groups bus thousands in every day to see the ruins, and
then race them off to Naples or the resort town of Sorrento,
bypassing the town of Pompeii. Most of the money the government
pledged to the town is earmarked to restore the 19th-century
basilica where the Madonna is kept, and to build hostels for
pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The town's inability to attract the development that would tempt
tourists is a typically southern Italian problem. Its region,
Campania, is prone to mudslides and earthquakes as well as deeply
infiltrated by the Neopolitan Mafia, known as the Camorra.
Legitimate businesses are reluctant to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Construction, mostly Mafia-controlled, is shoddy and illegal.
State money for public works projects has a history of getting
diverted along the way. The three previous mayors of Pompeii are
awaiting trial on corruption charges. When local law enforcement
officials want to tear down illegal housing, they call in the army
to insure it gets done.
</P>
<P>
   Staiano is well aware that his plan to select private investors
to build hotels and restaurants may mainly lure criminal groups,
and says local anticrime authorities are on the alert. ``We have to
face it,'' he said, referring to the risks endemic to construction
work in Campania. If nothing is done, he added, ``we will be safe
but dead'' economically.
</P>
<P>
   Organized crime is not the main concern of Guzzo, the
superintendent of the archeological site, but he has security
concerns of his own. He, too, is trying to change an entrenched
system _ in this case one of patronage and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Pompeii has 140 custodians, civil servants who can almost never
be dismissed. For instance, a guard who pleaded guilty to sexually
assaulting a young tourist from Texas in 1996 has retained his job.
</P>
<P>
   Pompeii guards are known to accept bribes to take tourists into
closed areas. Guzzo recently tried to clamp down by ordering that
all guards leave their keys in the front office. The order created
such a fuss that he had to back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these custodians have the same last names as people
who worked here in the 18th century,'' he said. ``It's difficult to
change in 3 years what has been going on for 250.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also struggling to resolve a debate raging between
archeologists and scholars over whether to dig more, or restore
what is already there. Only two-thirds of the original city of
Pompeii has been excavated. Beneath the Roman Pompeii, moreover,
there are fragments of societies dating back to the Bronze Age.
</P>
<P>
   Guzzo, who is determined to save what he has before uncovering
more, plans to offer Italian corporations a chance to sponsor
Pompeii villas and pay for restoration and maintenance. But he said
sponsors preferred the more glamorous public-relations payoff of
unearthing fresh sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more romantic to find new things than conserve what you
already know,'' he said with a weary smile.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some new features intended for the millennium are
already in place. Six villas have opened this year, as well as
three new pathways, which allow visitors to stroll in shaded areas
and even picnic among the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements, however, have created huge local uproars.
The site's directors have decided to let businesses bid for
franchises on several restaurants, bookstores and museum shops
inside the ancient city's gates. This has infuriated local vendors
whose livelihood depends on selling soft drinks, pizza, guidebooks
and souvenirs outside the gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked to go inside, but they only want big companies,''
Pietro Reggi, 23, complained from his souvenir stand. He has an
accounting degree, he said, but explained that the only work
available is the family-owned stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are speaking with the likes of Agnelli,'' he said,
referring to the family that created Fiat. ``We are nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Staring up resentfully at the walls, Reggi added, ``Pompeii is a
national treasure, but they are turning it into a Jurassic Park.''

STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE MORE GENEROUS THAN MEN, AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
No less an authority than Charles Darwin once claimed that women
differ from men in their ``greater tenderness and less
selfishness.'' But today, such observations are politically
incorrect, open to charges of sexism.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The claim also is empirically suspect. Psychologists and
economists who have devised experiments to test generosity,
altruism and cooperation often have found that women don't live up
to their stereotype and appear to be less generous or cooperative
than men.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical experiment, each subject gets a chit worth a
dollar. The subjects then are given a chance to donate it into a
common pool. Any chits they keep remain worth a dollar. But those
in the pool become worth two dollars and then are divided equally
among all the subjects.
</P>
<P>
   If subjects were trusting and cooperative, they would donate
everything to the pool and double their money. But individuals have
an incentive to hold back their chits because they will share the
pool regardless of whether they contribute. Of course, if no one
donates to the pool, everyone ends up worse off. (This incentive to
shirk is why governments tax their citizens rather than relying on
voluntary contributions to fund public programs.)
</P>
<P>
   In one such experiment reported in 1993, men proved much more
cooperative than women. In the first round of the game, for
example, men donated 94 percent of their holdings into the common
pool. Female subjects, on the other hand, donated only 72 percent
of their chits.
</P>
<P>
   But now it turns out that Darwin, and the conventional wisdom,
may have been right all along. New findings by economists Catherine
Eckel at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Philip Grossman at the
University of Texas restore the reputation of women as the more
generous sex.
</P>
<P>
   In a new paper published in Economic Journal, they point out the
flaw in previous research: The experiments all involved strategy.
In other words, they measured not just innate generosity or
cooperation, but how subjects guessed others would behave in turn.
Strategy games, where the payoff depends on interactions between
subjects, all involve risk, a contaminating factor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``There is a lot of evidence that suggests men are more
risk-loving than women,'' Grossman said. ``They engage in more
illegal drugs, unsafe sex and riskier recreational activity.'' The
different behavior of men and women in strategy games may reflect
their different responses to risk, not their natural level of
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   So Eckel and Grossman devised the simplest of all experiments,
called a Dictator game because one subject alone determines the
outcome. They gave each college-student subject $10 and invited him
or her to share the money with an anonymous partner. A selfish
subject would keep all the money; a generous one would split the
windfall more evenly.
</P>
<P>
   The results vindicated Darwin: Women, on average, donated twice
as much as men to their unseen partners. The average donation from
women was $1.60, versus 82 cents for men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few subjects could be termed generous: 47 percent of
women and 60 percent of men didn't hand over a dime. Most others
gave only a dollar or two. Maybe that reflects the fact that most
subjects were students studying topics such as economics and
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   EL NINO MOVES MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is one powerful baby. Besides shutting off the rain in
Australia and Southeast Asia, flooding Peru and sending exotic fish
up the coast of California, El Nino usually also manages to jolt
world commodity markets.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the naughty child has surprised economists:
Commodity prices are down, not up, despite predictions of global
climate disruption. Experts say the disruption of Asia's economies
has cut world commodity demand faster than El Nino could cut
commodity supplies.
</P>
<P>
   By upsetting traditional weather patterns, El Nino can disrupt
agricultural harvests, sending crop prices soaring. It also can
crimp the output of mines by flooding access roads, washing out
ports or drying out water sources used for hydraulic excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when scientists began predicting one of the largest
El Nino events in history, Federal Reserve Board economist Allan
Brunner started asking how it might affect commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper surveying data back to 1964, Brunner confirms
that El Nino does wield power over the economy as well as the
weather. A modest El Nino, he found, pushes up overall commodity
prices by 4 percent; a big one like that of 1982-83 boosted
commodity prices 30 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond mere commodities, Brunner reports, the ebb and flow
of El Nino can account for 10 to 15 percent of variation in world
price inflation and world economic output.
</P>
<P>
   In the infamous El Nino of 1982-83, for example, droughts in
Asia and Australia sharply increased grain prices. The disruption
of fisheries off South America fueled the nudge up in soybean
prices because fish meal is a substitute in some markets for
soymeal. And copper prices rose following floods in Chile, which
halted production in the mines.
</P>
<P>
   The latest El Nino also has hammered crops in Australia and
fisheries off Latin America, but the overall effect on commodity
prices appears to be subdued. Indeed, the International Monetary
Fund's non-oil commodity price index has fallen 15 percent in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Brunner said one reason is that by some geophysical measures,
this year's El Nino is actually much less severe than that of
1982-83. Another reason is that food prices have been on a downward
trend since peaking three years ago, when a variety of natural
disasters temporarily slashed world food stocks. Finally, and most
important, Asia's economic crisis has dampened demand for all sorts
of commodities, softening prices across the board.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETS AND ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that a strong economy can drive up the stock
market, but sometimes cause and effect are reversed. Lately, the
buoyant U.S. stock market helped the economy to boom, even in the
face of the crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market influences the health of the economy through
the ``wealth effect.'' When stock prices are high and households
feel confident, they are more prone to spend, particularly on
big-ticket items like houses, cars and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Second, higher stock prices help families meet their savings
objectives faster. Because people don't need to sock away as much
money for college or retirement, they spend more money, fueling an
economic surge.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs economist Ed McKelvey notes
that the value of stocks held by Americans soared to 143 percent of
gross domestic product by the end of last year, from 80 percent
three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in this ratio is more than double the
next-biggest rise over any three consecutive years in the postwar
era,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The gains also are probably more widely shared than ever. The
latest available survey, taken in 1995, found that 41 percent of
households owned equities or equity mutual funds, up from 32
percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   McKelvey estimates that the rise in stock prices spurred enough
new consumer spending and investment to contribute an extra
percentage point to GDP growth over each of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   One downside is that as people consume more, they save less of
their income. Last year, the personal savings rate fell to the
lowest level in 57 years, McKelvey reports. In the long run, the
economy needs domestic savings to fund new investment.
</P>
<P>
   But even people with no stock market holdings have benefited
from the recent surge in economic growth. Real wages are growing,
and the unemployment rate is at its lowest point in nearly three
decades. Just keep your fingers crossed that the market doesn't
tumble and take the economy down with it.

THE NRA CHANGES ITS SALES PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Va., N.J., Miss., Okla.)  (lh) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Weary of being seen as an extremist, right-wing
organization that is out of touch with mainstream America, the
National Rifle Association is going on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday's anticipated election of Charlton Heston as its
next president, to a slick new advertising campaign starting later
this month, the country's largest gun-owners' organization, with
2.8 million members, contended at its annual convention this
weekend that lazy prosecutors, lenient judges, gratuitous
television violence and irresponsible parents cause more problems
in America than guns.
</P>
<P>
   The group also began promoting the notion that gun owners are
ordinary, hard-working Americans, like the members of the Ryker
family of Springfield, Ore., whom Heston hailed at a banquet as
``American heroes.'' Jacob Ryker, 17, is the high school wrestler
who on May 21, tackled a teen-age gunman who killed two students
and injured 23, including Ryker, at Thurston High School in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   While these are not new concepts for the NRA, an organization
that supports tighter enforcement of criminal law rather than
further restrictions on gun ownership as a way to reduce crime, the
sales pitch is changing. And with a celebrity like Heston, who is
now the NRA's first vice president, leading the organization,
officials say they have their best opportunity in years to get a
fair hearing from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Charlton Heston is that he becomes the
megaphone to get our message out, a message that is not being heard
right now,'' Wayne R. LaPierre, Jr., the group's executive vice
president, said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been victims of image manipulation,'' he added,
referring to the press. ``It has been a long and slow process, but
it has become more bitter and demonic in recent years. It's wrong,
and it's inaccurate, and that sticks in the craw of our members
more than any other single point. It outrages Charlton.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day convention has played out against a backdrop of
protests by gun-control advocates here, where handguns have been
used in most of the city's homicides, and written pleas to Heston
on Friday from gun-control advocates like Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., who asked for the group's support for new measures to
protect children from shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association has always argued that gun-control
legislation is not the way to combat gun violence, and now the
challenge of persuasion falls to Heston, 73, whose measured, deep
voice served him so well in movies like ``The Ten Commandments''
and ``Ben-Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   In that same booming voice, Heston, who declined to be
interviewed until after the election, said at the banquet that the
Rykers were dedicated to ``tools that always worked, like courage,
duty, courtesy, teamwork, compassion and common sense.'' Praising
Jake and his 14-year-old brother, Josh, he said, ``I'll bet that
growing up, those boys felt a growing sense of community, a
community called America that stretched from coast to coast, from
sea to shining sea.''
</P>
<P>
   With the boys and their parents, Robert and Linda, standing
close by, he said softly in closing, ``Our country _ and our NRA _
is proud to claim them.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of 1,600 could not get to their feet to applaud
fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rifle association embarks on its latest efforts at
spin _ even trying to use a school shooting to its advantage _
officials are banking on more than Heston's celebrity and passion
to balance the scales of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   As the keynote speaker who preceded him, Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, offered the audience both a psychological and
political boost, saying he was ``tired of being on the defensive''
about the right to own a gun and assuring the crowd, saying, ``You
are the mainstream of America, and anyone who portrays you as
something other than that shows how far out of the mainstream they
are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lott struck other chords by vowing to oppose any efforts to
tighten gun-control laws and advocating more gun ownership as a way
to reduce violent crime. He proposed using police stations as
``self-defense centers'' to teach the proper use of guns and campus
Reserve Officer Training Corps programs to educate students about
gun use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is scared except the criminals,'' Lott said. ``The
way to change that is give the criminals something to be afraid of.
That something is a well-armed public.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, whose association lobbies for weapons makers and
distributors, said he discussed an experiment with Lott over the
weekend, in which one city would be designated to test the rifle
association's crime-fighting ideas. Theoretically, LaPierre said,
that would include vigorous prosecutions for gun-related crimes, as
well as harsh sentencing, no releases on bail, no plea bargaining
and the full support of the Department of Justice. The plan would
also encourage law-abiding citizens to own guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just give me one large American city, and I'll show you this
would work,'' he said, brandishing a report about a comparable
small-scale effort in Richmond this year, where preliminary
figures, from the U.S. attorney's office in Richmond, show that the
homicide rate is falling after holding firm for several years.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the chances of gaining such an opportunity are
slim, even with Lott's support. But those are the kind of
initiatives, he contends, that America needs to consider to reduce
violent crime, no matter how aggressively opponents portray NRA
members as extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The new advertising campaign is designed to counteract that
depiction. Based on similar ads used between 1972 and 1987, they
feature NRA members, some of them well-known, like Heston and Rep.
Steve Largent, R-Okla., who once played for the Seattle Seahawks,
saying they are proud to be NRA members and to support the Second
Amendment, which grants civilians the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the association seems to be counting on Heston
more than anything else, to provide a new profile for gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come here to take back what it ours,'' he said to
members on Saturday. ``Too many gun owners think we've wandered to
some fringe of American life and left them behind. We will win back
our rightful place in the mainstream of American political
debate.''

<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Ali Loeb seemed to be having some kind of
seizure. Arms flailing, knees buckling, she staggered across a
stage at this Bay Area town's high school emitting a shriek so
bone-rattling it sounded like a summons for paramedics. But all it
drew were gales of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Erdem Kiciman appeared to be choking. One hand clutching his
throat, he coughed and heaved and heaved and coughed in a manner
that suggested the urgent need for the Heimlich maneuver, or at
least a potent expectorant. But all he got were thunderclaps of
applause.
</P>
<P>
   What in the world was possessing Miss Loeb, a Harvard-bound
senior, Kiciman, a strapping sophomore on the water polo team, and
dozens of other scholars and athletes who turned Piedmont High
School's auditorium into a cacophony of wailing and whistling,
chest-thumping and cheek-thwacking? And why were the 600 people in
the audience reacting with such unalarmed delight?
</P>
<P>
   Because it was all for the birds, and a proud, peculiar
tradition was taking flight again.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the claim to fame of Piedmont, an affluent
community of about 10,500 residents nestled next to Oakland, had
been the high school's annual bird-calling contest, in which the
college-destined sons of physicians and daughters of lawyers took a
frivolous pause from more relevant endeavors to imitate the calls
of the wild.
</P>
<P>
   They made like macaws and emulated egrets, and the feistiest
migrated south to Burbank to appear on Johnny Carson's ``The
Tonight Show.'' But three years ago, after the death of the science
teacher who had started the competition, the din lapsed into
silence.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it screeched back, thanks principally to the hard
work and high ideals of two seniors, Mandy Gruber and Sara
Thierman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the skills you learn through bird-calling cannot be
learned in the classroom,'' said Miss Gruber, who will attend Brown
University in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Which skills might those be?
</P>
<P>
   Miss Gruber's answer was more like a question. ``Poise?'' she
said. ``Self-confidence?''
</P>
<P>
   She and Miss Thierman, who is headed to Yale University, honed
those attributes not only by coordinating the reborn contest, which
took place Sunday afternoon, but also by invoking the babble of the
pileated woodpecker, which they selected with careful thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some squeaking at the end, which is amusing,'' Miss
Gruber explained. ``Also, neither of us can whistle, so that cut
out a lot of birds.''
</P>
<P>
   They failed to finish in the top 3 of 12 acts, most of them duos
or trios, so they may not get to appear on ``The Late Show with
David Letterman,'' which has agreed to feature the most spirited
contestants on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you go wrong with birdcalls?'' said Rob Burnett, the
Letterman show's executive producer. ``It's the definition of money
in the bank, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest originated in 1964 with Leonard J. Waxdeck, who was
looking for a way to get his students excited about the natural
world.
</P>
<P>
   Although Waxdeck was a marine biologist by training, he thought
the skies afforded more easily replicated theater than the seas.
``You couldn't do too much with fish,'' Jean Waxdeck, his widow,
said in an interview on Thursday. ``They make a splash, but that's
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first years, he held the competition in his classroom.
But the crowds that filled the hallway suggested a wider appeal, so
the contest was moved to the auditorium and opened to all students
at the school. In 1974, it caught the attention of Carson, who made
it famous.
</P>
<P>
   Waxdeck found himself recognized on the street when vacationing
in Europe. Professional athletes from the Bay Area, local disk
jockeys and even Charles Schulz, the creator of ``Peanuts,'' came
to judge, evaluating the authenticity of all the warbling, clucking
and cooing by hunch as much as anything else.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To produce these sounds, students selected and studied any of
more than 400 possibilities from an aural library that Waxdeck and
Dale Porter, another science teacher, compiled. The tortured squawk
of a tufted puffin was a favorite. ``It's kind of like a big
burp,'' Porter explained.
</P>
<P>
   This year, students presented their offerings, from whooping
cranes to kookaburras, as the codas to skits that incorporated
information about the birds' habits and habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women adopted the singsong cadences of characters from
the movie ``Fargo'' to play Minnesota tourists in Hollywood who spy
a bird from their home state as they ogle the actor Patrick Swayze
through binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, ya!'' one of them said. ``That's definitely a greater
prairie chicken. It's got that great big chicken thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   They placed second, just ahead of Miss Loeb and her partner, who
impersonated the Manx shearwater, a raucous denizen of California's
coastline. Kiciman, who wore a pink tutu and plastic beak for his
fling as a flamingo, did not win.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors and a bag of birdseed went to two young men who
introduced the tremulous vibrato of the willow ptarmigan, common in
Alaska, with a song that equated its lovely ``plumage'' with its
``va-va-voom-age.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Loeb's father, Michael, shook his head at the end. ``One
thing's for sure,'' he said of his daughter, ``nothing will ever
embarrass her.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Janice Davocato's devotion to her disabled mother
has wiped out her savings and turned her into a seven-day-a-week
workhorse.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Sylvia Davocato, was taking care of her own mother
in 1986 when she fell in her South Philadelphia rowhouse and badly
broke a leg. She ended up with severe gangrene and a near-fatal
blood infection. When she left the hospital, it was in a
wheelchair, with a catheter. She is still in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, despite some help from the state, paying for her
76-year-old mother's care at home has largely fallen to Janice, a
40-year-old office manager: $80 a day for a private nurse for two
months when her mother came home, then $50 a day _ $75 on weekends
_ for an aide ever since. With free-lance typing jobs on the
weekends, she earns about $32,000 a year, of which about $11,000
goes for her mother's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had $30,000 saved from all my years of working,'' she said.
``That's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As Americans continue to live longer than ever, some elderly
people and their families are being caught in the gap between the
cost of long-term care, necessities ranging from private aides to
diapers, and the limited amount of government aid to pay for it.
And as the baby boomers age over the next 30 years and the over-85
population grows particularly fast, the need for such care will
only escalate, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Families Pay 40 Percent of Health Care Burden
</P>
<P>
   Already, about 6.5 million people, nearly a fifth of the
population 65 years and older, require assistance and about 22
million families _ nearly one in four _ are providing some form of
assistance to an older relative or friend.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention on the problems in Social Security, the
federal pension program, or Medicare, the federal health insurance
program for the elderly, many experts say that the gap in long-term
care coverage poses the most immediate and often most devastating
threat to the financial security of older Americans and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly $91 billion spent on long-term care and nursing
homes in 1995, the elderly and their families paid almost 40
percent, double the proportion paid out of pocket for that year's
overall health spending of $991 billion, according to the Health
Care Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But little is being done about the gap, in part because of its
sheer size. Policy-makers fear an overwhelming demand for services
from families that are now caring for elderly relatives themselves
at no cost to the government.
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents: While Medicaid is thought of as a federal
health insurance program for the poor, it also pays nursing homes
for the cost of caring for residents who have exhausted their
savings; in 1995, 68 percent of Medicaid's total spending on the
elderly went to nursing homes. And since Medicare, the federal
health insurance for the elderly, began providing some home-care
benefits, spending on them grew to $18.3 billion in 1996 from $3.8
billion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians worry that if they make it a benefit it will get
overused, and everyone will use it,'' said Diane Rowland, executive
vice president of Henry Kaiser Family Foundation, a national health
care philanthropic organization. ``The other side of the coin is
that many families will continue to endure, and will only use
outside services when they need them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress' dirty little secret is Medicaid,'' said Sen. John
Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., one of the few members of Congress
pressing the long-term care issue. ``When someone says, `Oh, you
don't provide for longtime care, we say, `Yes, we do, you just
spend down and go into Medicaid.' But at what price?''
</P>
<P>
   `There Are Times I'm So Tired I Could Cry'
</P>
<P>
   With few answers coming from Washington, adult children whose
parents aren't ill enough for a nursing home or who are determined
to keep their parents at home, improvise and struggle along as best
they can, their fortunes altered by the facts of old age and
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Lynn Mokos, a care manager for the Pennsylvania Area Agency
for Aging, which provides home care assistance, has heard hundreds
of stories like that of the Davocatos. She works with 80 families
in Bucks County, outside Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-class people, educated people, can believe that `those'
people _ whoever `those' people are _ have enough money to care for
themselves,'' Ms. Mokos said. ``They have no idea how easily this
could happen to any one of us. It could be them. `Those' people
includes you and me. It's us.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day at lunchtime, Linda Stumm, a 46-year-old mother of two
teen-age sons, leaves her job as an elementary school secretary and
goes home to change her mother's diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stumm's mother, Lena Pimpinella, 78, was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease 13 years ago. Unable to speak, or to eat or to
move without help, she spends her days on a hospital bed in the
living room of her daughter's rowhouse in South Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stumm does not consider a nursing home an acceptable option
for her mother, but she says she does not know how much longer her
energy will hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I'm so tired I could just cry,'' she said one
afternoon as she fed her mother yogurt with a spoon. ``Child care
eventually evolves to less and less. There's no end to this. You
know you're going to be changing diapers all the time. It's always
the same. It just gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial implications are immense. If there does exist a
nursing home that could provide her mother with the proper love,
dignity and care, Mrs. Stumm said, it is surely not one she could
afford. Nursing homes providing basic care can easily cost $40,000
a year, and nearly two out of three families end up relying on
welfare _ Medicaid _ to pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stumm does receive substantial help from the state to help
care for her mother at home, but she bears most of the caregiving
burden herself. And the toll is high.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of her mother's disease, Mrs. Stumm stayed
home from work for two years to provide the constant care that was
needed. Then she gave up her former position as a legal secretary,
and went back to work as a $15,000-a-year school secretary _ half
the salary of her old job _ because it allowed her flexibility to
care for her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her elder son, Greg Jr., a 16-year-old honors student,
wants to go to the University of Pennsylvania. Mrs. Stumm and her
husband, Greg Sr., 47, a laid-off welder retraining as a public
schools building engineer, say they don't know how they will afford
any college.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Stumm's mother, nearly two-thirds of the disabled
elderly live at home or with relatives. But even while Pennsylvania
and other states are shifting money toward home care, nearly
two-thirds of public spending for long-term care for the elderly
still goes to nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pennsylvania, which has a greater percentage of
residents over age 60 than any state but Florida, spent $2.3
billion on nursing home care, and $184 million on home and
community-based care for the elderly, with most of that smaller
amount coming from the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people who are getting older, and the number of
people in late life who are living longer, is growing faster than
the lottery is,'' said the Pennsylvania secretary of aging, Richard
Browdie. ``I wish I could say to you that we would be able to serve
everyone who needs it. But there's not enough money to do it for
everybody. It's a national problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people with a disabled elderly relative face painful
options. Some make the choice of placing a parent in a nursing
home, despite its lack of privacy, often minimal care, and high
cost. Others, like Linda Stumm and Janice Davocato, keep their
relatives at home by piecing together assistance from the state _
if they qualify for it _ from private aides they pay for
themselves, and from their own labor.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia and Janice Davocoto live together in a rowhouse in South
Philadelphia. Mrs. Davocato, who was a housewife, has no savings,
and meager Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Davocato would not consider a nursing home, ``not for my
mother.'' For the past seven years, Philadelphia Corp. on Aging, a
nonprofit group that serves the elderly in the Philadelphia region,
has provided her mother with an aide five days a week, for three
hours a day. Ms. Davocoto, who hires a private aide to cover the
remaining hours in the day and weekends, says the help from the
state has reduced her costs by about $18 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took a great burden off me,'' she said. ``I'm blessed to
get as many hours as I do. There's people who can't get anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been so demoralized by watching her mother suffer and by
her own difficulties in getting help that she says, only
half-joking, that she has developed a plan should she become
disabled in old age: ``I'm going to go right off the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so long ago, when Fedele Capozzi, 85,
could not have imagined turning to the government for help. He was
earning good money as a real estate appraiser. He and his wife,
Elvira, who is 83, had a home on one of the most beautiful blocks
in South Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Vail, Paris, Italy,'' Capozzi said. ``If my wife
wanted new drapes, I'd say, `Put 'em in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, Mrs. Capozzi was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's disease. Her memory went. She became incontinent. She
refused to walk up the stairs of the house where they had lived for
57 years.
</P>
<P>
   Capozzi sold the house and moved them into an apartment. He
hired aides, at $8 an hour, to bathe his wife, dress her, change
her diapers and help him with cooking and cleaning. The cost:
$30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, after going through his savings, Capozzi became
eligible for help from the state. Philadelphia Corp. on Aging
assigned him an aide for six hours a day. Capozzi still spends $380
a week on a private aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why they give me this help,'' he said one
morning while his wife, who no longer recognizes him, was eating a
breakfast of cereal and fresh strawberries that he had prepared for
her. ``They're smart, in a dumb way. If my wife was sent to a
nursing home, it would cost the state $46,000 a year. The state is
saving money, giving me 42 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   And Capozzi is right if he feels caught in the middle. ``It is
the middle class that gets squeezed the most,'' said Raymond
Coward, a gerontologist and dean of health and human services at
the University of New Hampshire. The wealthy can afford to buy the
care they need, he said, and the poor qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely to stay that way, many experts say, as long as
the issue is not addressed on a national level, because of its
potential cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every serious proposal for long-term care basically comes down
to spending more money, either publicly or privately,'' said Joshua
Wiener, a health policy analyst with the Urban Institute in
Washington. ``And that's not a popular position right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has come up with private long-term care insurance.
But many experts say that its high cost makes it an answer only for
the affluent. The average annual premium for policies covering four
years of nursing home and home care in 1995 was $1,124 if bought at
age 50, $2,560 if bought at age 65, and $8,146 a year if bought at
age 75, according to the Health Insurance Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Ferraro, 77, recently received a postcard from a company
warning of the ``devastating'' financial consequences of nursing
homes _ and pitching long-term care insurance.

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ferraro, who also lives in Philadelphia, has already gone
through much of her savings taking care of her husband, Joe, who
was paralyzed by a stroke seven years ago and who died last month
at age 79. She is still caring for a 90-year-old aunt, who also had
a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that any company would sell Mrs. Ferraro
insurance. She has had double bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Ruth, 61, could never afford long-term care insurance,
either. She has gone through most of her savings to care for her
85-year-old mother, Catherine Ruth, who suffered a stroke three
years ago and is paralyzed and bedridden at home.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, and the state, provide Ms. Ruth with some home care
assistance. But it is not nearly enough. Two years ago, Ms. Ruth, a
licensed practical nurse, quit her $14.60-an-hour job so she could
care for her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ruth's care manager is Jo Lynn Mokos. ``This woman is
absolutely and totally devoted to her mother,'' Ms. Mokos said.
``She will die before she will put her mother in a nursing home.
She says, `What is going to happen to me when I get old?' We can't
tell her, `You're going to be OK.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll end up in a nursing home _ where she won't put her
mother.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAN WAN YAI, Thailand _ Sitting on the ground beside her hut,
Bangon Phailak chopped up wild plants for lunch and pondered a
wrenching question.
</P>
<P>
   What does her 4-year-old daughter need more, food or a mother?
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bangon, a gentle woman whose soft face is framed by thick
black hair, explained that the family cannot afford both. As a
result of the Asian financial crisis, her husband has lost his job
as a construction worker, so the family earns only a trickle of
cash through odd jobs in this tiny village in northeast Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   That money can be used to buy rice and milk for the little girl,
Saiyamon, who has become anemic and malnourished. Or Mrs. Bangon
can try to save the tattered small-denomination bills to pay for a
stomach operation that she needs to save her own life.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mrs. Bangon has chosen to spend the money on Saiyamon.
She herself has already lived for 32 years and, she reasons, what
would be the point of preserving a mother at the cost of a child?
</P>
<P>
   Seen up close in villages, the Asian financial crisis is not a
conundrum of currency pegs and credit crunches and various
imponderables. In households like Mrs. Bangon's, it is as immediate
as a typhoon, and rather more deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, at least we had enough rice,'' Mrs. Bangon said
softly. ``These days, we don't even have enough to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 months since the crisis exploded in Thailand and began
spreading through the region, the most prominent victims have been
the humbled tycoons in the big cities, and they have indeed fallen
farthest. But they are neither the most common victims nor the most
desperate. The worst off are those like Mrs. Bangon, who were
already at the margins of society _ those who had almost nothing
before and who now, somehow, have even less.
</P>
<P>
   A lag in the data means that there are few statistics so far on
the social impact of the crisis. Most evidence of the human cost is
anecdotal, gleaned from travels through remote areas in Asia and
from the findings of rural clinics and aid workers like field
representatives of the relief group Oxfam. They report that many
Indonesian mothers can no longer afford milk, which has tripled in
price, and are giving their babies tea.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges suggests increases in death rates,
school dropouts, and malnutrition. Some experts say that the legacy
of the crisis will be felt long after the region's economies are
purring again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When children are malnourished before they are 5 years old,
the impact on their intelligence is permanent,'' said Dr. Anugerah
Pekerti, chairman of World Vision Indonesia, an aid organization.
``When you combine the two factors we're now seeing _ malnutrition
and its impact on IQ, and also children dropping out of primary
school _ the impact will be quite devastating 10 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia has always had many poor areas and hungry children, so the
problems are not new. But they have been hugely magnified. On the
eve of the crisis, Indonesia had about 20 million people who lived
below the poverty line, getting by with a per capita income of less
than $1 a day. Now World Bank officials suggest that the number of
people below this poverty line may surge to 40 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   For those 40 million, and for the tens of millions more who live
in similar deprivation in countries like Thailand, Vietnam and
Burma, the poverty does not necessarily just mean living more
simply. In extreme cases, it means living not at all.

<P>
   The Ill
</P>
<P>
   Many Prayers, But No Medicine
</P>
<P>
   In the Thai hillside village of Pasingh, near the border with
Laos, Som Chianda is the heavily tattooed patriarch of a family
living in a dark brown wooden house. Each day, Som and his wife
pray at the Buddhist altar on one side of the living room for a son
who is quietly dying on the other side of the room.
</P>
<P>
   The son, Lamkwan, 32, is a casualty of the Asian financial
crisis, for the devaluation of the Thai currency has left his
family unable to afford the medicine that he needs to keep him
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Lamkwan suffers from a severe lung ailment, but his doctors
prescribed a medicine that for three years kept the sickness in
check. The medicine was expensive, $50 a month, but the family
could afford it with the money sent home by Lamkwan's two brothers
working as laborers in Bangkok, the Thai capital 300 miles to the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, the crisis in Thailand worsened. The cost of
the medicine soared to $120 a month, and the two brothers lost
their jobs and stopped sending money. So the parents stopped giving
Lamkwan his medicine, and he began to deteriorate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day he gets worse,'' said his mother, Sanguan Chianda,
as he looked on placidly a few feet away. ``Mentally, he's going
downhill, because he's thinking too much about it. And then someday
he won't be able to eat any more, and then he'll lose his strength.
And then he'll be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The heaviest feeling in the world is to have no money, to be
unable to continue his medicine,'' she said. ``The helplessness is
overwhelming. We can't help our own son. We can just sit and watch
him get worse day by day.''
</P>
<P>
   The end, she said, will probably come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lamkwan is one data point in a health-care crisis that is
brewing across Asia because of the financial crisis. Medicine in
the region is often imported, and thus sometimes doubled or even
quadrupled in price when local currencies tumbled against the
dollar. A result, according to rural doctors and social workers, is
that people are dying who would normally be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, children are dropping out of schools, which play an
important role in monitoring their health by arranging check-ups,
vaccinations and referrals to doctors. The schools also teach basic
practices like hand-washing and cultivate a more educated
population that in the long run will be more conscious of hygiene
and will be crucial to sustaining Asia's industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Data on school drop-outs are scarce, but in Thailand officials
say that an unpublished government survey of school enrollment
indicates that 40,000 to 50,000 first-graders have dropped out of
the school system this year alone. That amounts to 4 percent of all
first-graders, and with other survey information it suggests that
the number of elementary school drop-outs in Thailand may have
almost tripled.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the government warns that 8 million elementary and
junior high school students may drop out this year, compared with
2.8 million in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, governments in countries like Indonesia and
Thailand have had to cut spending, and a result in some cases has
been an end to school lunches and cutbacks for public-health
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have village hygiene organizations and
public-health representatives in the village, but now we've had to
cut all that back,'' said Chitana Saribut, a 28-year-old nurse at a
rural clinic in northeast Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Chitana said the budget of the clinic had been cut 30
percent, even as the cost of medicines soared. As a result, the
clinic is out of penicillin, fever medicine and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When patients come to us,'' she said, ``we often have nothing
to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thirsty
</P>
<P>
   Splinters on Menu Because of Drought
</P>
<P>
   Sickness and death are closely linked to malnutrition, and the
spreading hunger is readily visible in places like the little
village clearing in Indonesia where Wilhelmina Boemao was preparing
her dinner behind her thatch-roof hut. On the menu that night:
boiled wood.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Boemao, a tall, good-natured woman living in West Timor,
Indonesia, is being forced by hunger to eat putak, the wood of a
kind of palm tree that grows wild. She chops up the putak and boils
it into splinters that taste as unpalatable as they sound, or else
she grinds it into what she calls flour, but it is actually
sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis has coincided with crippling droughts caused
by El Nino currents. So rain has not fallen and crops have failed,
particularly in eastern Indonesia. With no rice and corn, villagers
are turning in desperation to anything edible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I used putak to feed pigs, and even they didn't
like it,'' Miss Boemao said. ``I never ate putak. My grandmother
used to talk about eating it in hard times, and my mother may have
eaten it once or twice, but in my lifetime, never.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in normal times, the drought would be a calamity, but it is
doubly so in the middle of an economic crisis. First, families have
less cash income to buy food, because prices have gone up and
because people have lost their jobs. Second, Indonesia's
government, absorbed by financial problems and political upheaval,
has not been able to help the villagers, and will be hard-pressed
to import grain to cover the shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the boom years, 39 percent of Indonesia's children
were malnourished, according to World Bank figures, along with 45
percent of Vietnamese children. Most experts expect those figures
to increase, but such numbers are a bit unreal because it is
impossible to tabulate accurate health statistics for peasants who
are so poor that they cannot afford to go to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In remote villages of West Timor, it is easy to see children who
display the thin limbs and light, patchy hair that are signs of
malnutrition; such children are visible everywhere except in the
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rarely see people suffering from severe malnutrition,''
said Dr. Joyce Manek, director of a little hospital in the city of
Soe. ``Because if they can't afford food, then they can't afford to
come to a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, doctors at two remote clinics said that the number of
their patients had fallen by up to half. The doctors explained that
families now use any bit of cash to buy food, so they no longer can
afford to pay a consultation fee that is the equivalent of 5 cents
in U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Migrants
</P>
<P>
   Hunger, Hiding and Brutal Police
</P>
<P>
   It is not just poverty that keeps people from going to doctors,
but also fear. Among the most desperate people in Asia these days
are the migrant workers who are hiding from police crackdowns
aiming to send them home to their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of Bangkok, a gravel road tapers into dirt and then
nothingness. At first the area seems a deserted swamp, but at dusk
it comes alive with hundreds of Burmese laborers hiding from the
police in hovels and half-constructed buildings. One of them is
Adahm, a 20-year-old construction worker wearing a rubber sandal on
his left foot but none on his right foot, his sarong knotted
tightly around his waist.
</P>
<P>
   Adahm said his wife was five months pregnant. She has not seen a
doctor, and he is agonizing about what to do. Should he take her to
a clinic and risk being turned in to the police and deported, or
should he keep her hidden in his hut and risk her death and the
baby's?
</P>
<P>
   Asia has several million migrants like Adahm who travel to
wealthier countries without passports, savings or local language
skills, simply hoping that they will somehow get jobs and save
money and ensure a better life for their children. They have been
the worst-hit victims of surging unemployment throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Some 22,000 people have lost their jobs in Asia each day so far
this year, and many more layoffs are expected. With jobs
disappearing, foreign migrants have become natural scapegoats. So
each country is cracking down on migrants and trying to ship them
home: Singapore is sending home the Malaysians, the Malaysians are
sending home the Thais and Indonesians, and the Thais are sending
home the Burmese.
</P>
<P>
   The growing resentment against foreigners is leading to
increasing reports of abuse. Indonesians accuse the Malaysian
police of clubbing and torturing them before deporting them, while
in Thailand the Burmese say that they are being cheated by
employers and robbed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at three construction sites where I was never paid at
all,'' Adahm said. In all, he said, he was owed the equivalent of
more than $1,000, but construction bosses simply laughed at him,
knowing that if he complained, they could have him arrested and
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The migrants say that the possibility of arrest evokes special
horror because the police frequently steal a family's entire
savings and abuse people as they wish. Maung Moe and Ko Soe Win,
two Burmese men who were detained in Thailand earlier this year,
assert in a written statement prepared with the help of aid workers
that the police routinely beat the Burmese men in their detention
center and raped the women.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening, they say, the Thai police raped a young Burmese
woman in front of her mother. Finally, the daughter and mother
threw a piece of plastic twine over a bar above the toilet in their
cell and committed suicide together by hanging themselves from
opposite ends of the single length of twine.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety Net
</P>
<P>
   Where Foragers and Lenders Live
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the deprivation caused by the crisis, the situation
is not uniformly bleak. Some people are dying or suffering greatly,
but Asia is a more complex and varied canvas than a focus solely on
the victims would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the most wretched there are also many poor people like
Bulu Kadi. Kadi, a 55-year-old peasant with a head of unkempt hair
and a machete tucked under his belt, is lean and hungry but still
not remotely worried that he will ever starve.
</P>
<P>
   Kadi and his neighbors in Puumawo, a village on the small
Indonesian island of Sumba, are running out of food, and the
village is so remote that the government will never manage to send
relief. To get to Kadi's house, one must hike for a couple of miles
through the muddy rice paddies from the nearest gravel road, then
wade across a creek, and finally balance on a log that is the only
bridge over a river.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Kadi recounts how he manages to get by, the conversation
underscores the two safety nets that have protected Asia from far
worse suffering. Most countries in Asia do not have the kind of
safety net popular in the West _ unemployment insurance, welfare
system, food stamps _ but nonetheless there are two cushions to
soften the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the strong mutual support system that links people
together. The second is the natural bounty of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition here is that if people don't have food, they can
borrow from their neighbors,'' said Kadi. ``If you borrow one sack
of rice, you have to pay back two sacks. People always help each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadi's thatch-roof hut is in its own world outside the cash
economy. But he has borrowed two sacks of rice from a nephew, and
this traditional system of lending rice on 100 percent interest
rates has created a crude but effective banking system that rescues
the needy and encourages savings.
</P>
<P>
   Asian society is urbanizing and becoming looser-knit, but most
laid-off workers still have relatives in a village somewhere _ a
place that they call home and to which they can return at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical climate and abundance of the land offer a second
kind of safety net. The putak that the villagers are eating in
Timor may not be tasty, but it is edible. Two doctors said that the
wood can be a source of carbohydrates _ a poor source, but enough
to keep people alive.
</P>
<P>
   In short, these two safety nets offer a rare bit of consolation
that however bad things are, they could be much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Kadi and his neighbors are supplementing their diet with
grasshoppers, wild potatoes, wild pumpkins, leaves and a root
called wee-ah. Peasants normally avoid wee-ah because it must be
repeatedly boiled and soaked or else it gives anyone who eats it a
severe rash, but in a pinch there is enough wee-ah around to tide
people through almost any food shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere one goes in Asia, it seems people are cutting their
food expenses by resorting to nature. In her roadside home in a
rural area of northern Thailand, Maesubin Sisoipha bounced her
3-year-old granddaughter on her knee and nibbled on a breakfast
that did not cost anything at all: fried beetles served with mango
leaves and rice and fish paste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We catch the beetles ourselves,'' Mrs. Maesubin said. ``The
mango leaves we pick from a tree. The rice we grow ourselves. And
we make the fish paste from fish we catch in the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Maesubin said her two sons, laid off from their jobs in
Bangkok, are returning soon to the village. But she does not
anticipate any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to stay in this house, but it'll be no problem to
feed the extra mouths,'' she said. ``We'll just have to look for
more beetles for them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House will announce on Monday that according to an
analysis by government scientists, El Nino joined the Earth's
continuing overall warming trend to break global temperature
records in each of the first five months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average surface temperature of the Earth was the
highest recorded since people began measuring it with thermometers
in the mid-19th century. The new information not only extended the
record-breaking pattern, it did so to a degree that the scientists
described as unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said the scientists, global warming appears to be
exacerbating the effects of El Nino, which have included droughts
in some places and heavy rains in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set temperature records in every month since January, and
it appears that this general warming trend is making the effects of
El Nino worse,'' Vice President Al Gore said in a written statement
issued by the White House. ``This is a reminder once again that
global warming is real and that unless we act we can expect more
extreme weather in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was to present the findings at the White House on Monday
morning, with the scientists who performed the climatic analysis. A
Clinton administration official said Gore was trying to send a
message to Congress that it is urgent to enact a $6.3 billion,
five-year program of financial incentives and technological
research aimed at cutting emissions of heat-trapping
industrial-waste gases like carbon dioxide, which is produced by
the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The measure is
facing slow going on Capitol Hill, partly because of resistance on
the issue from some parts of the fossil fuel industry and its
allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the temperature findings are not new. Surface
temperature records have been set several times in the 1990s, and
mainstream scientists have been saying for some time that emissions
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are probably at least
partly responsible. But the year-to-year changes until now have
been tiny, measured in increments of hundredths of a degree.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the global average for January through May jumped
half a degree from the same period a year earlier. In the last
months of 1997 and the first months of 1998, the natural warming of
the Pacific Ocean known as El Nino was responsible for much of the
increase in temperature, scientists have said all along.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino has faded, drastically so in the last three weeks, so it
is questionable whether the records will hold up for the rest of
1998. The second half of the year ``is not likely to be as warm as
the first part,'' said Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who
studies El Nino and global warming but did not participate in the
new analysis. Still, he said, 1998 ``could turn out to be a record
year, easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The January-through-May temperature jump was described as
``really rather spectacular'' by Thomas Karl, senior scientist at
the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., who was in
charge of the analysis. ``To see every month breaking the record is
rather significant.'' The first reaction of most meteorologists to
a graph of the trend, he said, would probably be ``scratching the
head and saying something must be wrong with the data.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that surface readings and those taken by different
instruments aboard two Earth satellites all show the trend, ``so
we're very confident that 1998 far exceeds anything we've seen
before.''
</P>
<P>
   For the five months as a whole, according to the federal
analysis, the average global surface temperature was 1.76 degrees
above an average of 61.7 degrees for the bench mark period of 1961
to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is partly explained and partly muddied by El Nino.
On one hand, the exceptionally warm sea-surface temperatures in the
tropical Pacific that are characteristic of El Nino are said by
scientists to warm the globe generally. On the other hand, it is
difficult to know to what extent El Nino is responsible for the
1997-98 acceleration of the global warming trend.
</P>
<P>
   But Karl noted that in 1997-98, the average global temperature
was nearly a degree higher than the 1961 to 1990 average. This is
twice as much above the bench mark as in 1982-83, when an equally
strong edition of El Nino dominated the climate. If global warming
is responsible for the extra heat, Karl said, then it is probably
exacerbating the regional climatic effects that El Nino brought
home so clearly over the last fall and winter: Wild fires, droughts
and heavy rains. These ``are going to become more frequent in the
future'' if global temperatures continue to increase as predicted,
Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of scientists advising the United Nations has predicted
that the average surface temperature of the Earth will rise by 2 to
6 degrees by the end of the next century, with a best estimate of
3.5 degrees, if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. This,
they said, will disrupt the Earth's climate, causing climatic and
agricultural zones to shift, increasing precipitation, making
droughts more severe and forcing the sea level to rise.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with the projected 3.5-degree increase, the Earth
is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than it was in the depths of the last
Ice Age some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in Kyoto, Japan, more than 150 nations agreed to
a diplomatic protocol under which industrialized countries were to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by
about 5 percent from 1990 levels by about 2010. The Kyoto Protocol,
as it is called, is widely viewed as a first step in cutting the
emissions. Delegates are meeting in Bonn, Germany, in preliminary
talks on details of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Trenberth said that the temperature increase in the first five
months of 1998 is all the more remarkable because the warmth is
well above an average that was already high because it included the
effects of a global warming of about 1 degree over the preceding
century.
</P>
<P>
   As for El Nino, its fading in recent weeks portends a more
active hurricane season in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of
Mexico, several scientists have said. One of El Nino's effects is
to suppress the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic and
Caribbean, and, consequently, last year was a year of relatively
little hurricane activity.

 &HT;    Midnight Magic
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- They don't call former basketball star Earvin Johnson
``Magic'' for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He's won five NBA championship rings. He's silenced critics who
said his movie theaters in Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles would
bomb. He's even beaten oddsmakers who predicted he'd be dead by
now, nearly seven years after announcing he has the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson hopes to slam dunk his new syndicated late-night
talk show, ``The Magic Hour,'' which debuts at midnight on WAGA, he
might need a new nickname.
</P>
<P>
   How about ``Miracle''?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't put the time and effort that I need to put into the
show, I will fall _ and fall fast,'' Johnson has said.
</P>
<P>
   At least give the guy points for honesty. Johnson knows that it
will take more than his mile-wide grin and slick ``show time''
moves for his show to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Magic Hour'' is the latest celebrity-driven talker in the
late-night sweepstakes, a woeful lottery littered with the battered
egos of those who've failed: Chevy Chase, Dennis Miller, Whoopi
Goldberg, Lauren Hutton, Pat Sajak, Rick ``Disco Duck'' Dees and,
most recently, Keenen Ivory Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched those shows and we've learned a lot,'' says
Geovanni Brewer, one of the producers of ``The Magic Hour.'' ``We
don't plan on making those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wayans' canceled show and Sinbad's barely breathing
``Vibe,'' which targets younger, urban and minority viewers, ``The
Magic Hour'' wants an audience that's more mainstream. Johnson is
shooting for the same crowd that watched his late-night idol,
Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson's no Carson, the show's producers scrapped the
traditional opening monologue. Instead, the rookie host will get an
assist from sidekick Craig Shoemaker, a little-known stand-up comic
who'll do ``bits'' with Johnson at the top of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Other comedians have been hired to perform pre-taped sketches,
some including Johnson as various characters.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a gimmick from Carol Burnett's long-running variety
show and banking on Johnson's ``aw shucks'' charm, he'll also do an
unrehearsed Q&AMP;A segment with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says no subject will be off-limits and that Johnson
expects questions about the sexual recklessness that almost cost
him his career _ and his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants to ask him about that, he won't be shy to
respond, but it's not that type of show,'' she says. ``This is
going to be purely entertainment, a feel-good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, won't be grilling his opening week guests, who
include Harrison Ford and Peta Wilson on Tuesday; Arsenio Hall,
Gloria Estefan and Michael Douglas on Wednesday; Christine Lahti
and Kenny G on Thursday; and Gillian Anderson and Johnson's former
basketball coach, Pat Riley, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The show's house band will be fronted by Sheila E., a move
Johnson's spin doctors are touting _ incorrectly _ as a late night
first. (Wayans had an ``all-girl'' band. It still didn't help).
</P>
<P>
   Sheila E., a former Prince protege and daughter of rock pioneer
Peter ``Coke'' Escovedo, is one of the world's best percussionists.
She'll be joined by her brother Peter, also an accomplished
musician.
</P>
<P>
   As added insurance in Atlanta, ``The Magic Hour'' should get a
boost from its late-night lead-in: the highly rated ``Jerry
Springer Show,'' which airs at 11.
</P>
<P>
   A legendary stickler for preparation when he was playing
basketball, Johnson has spent months doing rehearsal shows and
taking lessons from a voice and interviewing coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax and make a space, like it's your home,'' Johnson said
recently about the cozy ambience his handlers want him to create on
the set.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also getting pointers from Jay Leno, against whom his
show competes in several key markets, and Hall, a buddy and former
gabmaster.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds great on paper. But late-night talk shows don't
exist on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Steele, senior vice president for Zenith Media, a New
York consulting firm, was impressed by Johnson during a
presentation he made to promote the show to advertisers. But Steele
voiced doubts that the show will last beyond its initial 13-week
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very charismatic and sweet and likable, and he's turned
his adversity into a higher level of celebrity,'' Steele says.
``All of that is good for initial audience curiosity, but the show
itself will have to be even better (than other late-night shows) if
it's going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the show is an air ball or a swish will be up to the man
who has been pulling surprises out of his bag of tricks for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, when the Lakers blew it, Magic blew it,'' Johnson
says. ``That's what went along with the title of being a leader.
With this show I just think we're going to be a winner. I feel
we're going to be a winner.''

 &HT;    When there's not enough food
 &HT;    By Stell Simonton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Thirty or so years ago, Rick Bragg was a poor boy
growing up in northeast Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know then, like I know now, that my mama never ate
until we were done,'' he writes in his book ``All Over But the
Shoutin'''.
</P>
<P>
   His mother ate what was left over. She was making sure her three
sons got their fill, because there wasn't quite enough food to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bragg is now a writer for The New York Times and has plenty
of money for food. But some people _ even today in our rich country
_ don't.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of times, adults who don't have much money find it hard to
buy groceries, pay rent and buy all the other things their families
need. They may put enough food on the table, but it's a struggle _
and it's a bad feeling.
</P>
<P>
   About one out of every eight households in this country have
that kind of trouble, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. The department _ along with the Census Bureau and
other government departments _ learned this by gathering
information from 45,000 people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Those households reported that they had to do things such as cut
back on the amount of food the adults ate so the children would
have enough. Or they borrowed food or got groceries from a church
or food pantry that gives away free food. Or they bought cheaper
food that was not as healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture calls this being ``food
insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are worse than insecure for about one out of every 25
households. Adults in those households told the Census Bureau they
often go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst case _ in about one out of every 100 households _
even the children did not get enough to eat. The department calls
this ``severe hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that if you are in a classroom of 25
students, probably three of those kids belong to families that have
trouble buying enough food.
</P>
<P>
   If your school is in a rich neighborhood, maybe no one has
trouble buying groceries. But if your school serves kids who live
in poor areas, more kids may be going hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Families are embarrassed and hurting when they can't buy food,
says Sandra Robertson of the Georgia Citizens Coalition on Hunger.
``Not many people are willing to share that kind of pain in
public,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKOUT - OPTIONAL

   Hungry for answers
</P>
<P>
   By Benita Dodd
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgians are starving,'' actress Jane Fonda said in a speech
in April. She was talking about how poor some people are in
Georgia. The very next day, she said she was wrong and apologized
for the remark. People are not actually dying of hunger in our
state. But her speech made many people want to know how big a
problem hunger really is.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is the main cause of world hunger. About 20 percent of
the world's 4 billion people are underfed, according to Margaret
Missiaen, an agricultural economist formerly with the Department of
Agriculture. Of the people who don't get enough to eat, about half
live in or near India. About two-fifths live in African and Asian
countries.Hunger 101
</P>
<P>
   In a class called Hunger 101 taught by the Atlanta Community
Food Bank, instructors pass out raisins, with some kids getting a
few, some kids getting a handful, others getting none. It's a
lesson that helps show how things are not always fair and equal in
this world. The class also explains why people suffer from hunger
and how you can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me see through the eyes of those in need,'' said one
student who took the class. The free, one-day class is held for
groups of all ages _ kids through adults. For more information,
call 404-892-3333 or check the Web site at http://www.acfb.org/
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Web site also has a great explanation of how you can
organize a food drive.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency help
</P>
<P>
   A food bank is a place that gives free food to those who need
it. Many churches sponsor food banks, sometimes called a food
pantry. To find if there's one near you, call 211. To find out how
you can help volunteer at a food bank.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do to help
</P>
<P>
   Find out the nearest food bank or food pantry. Volunteer to help
out there. Maybe you could organize things on the shelves or help
clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Groups and organizations can hold a food drive: collect food
items for a food bank.
</P>
<P>
   Go with your family to a community kitchen to help serve food.
Go on a day that's not a holiday, because plenty of people usually
help on holidays.

   You'll miss the flavor of Ginger, but you can still catch the
rest of the Spice Girls at their June 18 show in Atlanta. The
redheaded Ginger, also known as Geri Halliwell, quit the group last
week to go her own way. Baby, Scary, Posh and Sporty said they are
``saddened,'' but added, ``We are here to stay.'' Ticket sales at
Atlanta's Lakewood Amphitheatre are ``excellent; we have a couple
of thousand left'' of the 19,000 being sold, said Lakewood general
manager Clay Schell. He said the venue had received no calls
complaining about Ginger's absence at the scheduled show.
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Salsa, once a lowly condiment like ketchup, can
now get credit as a vegetable in school lunches. To count, it has
to be at least an eighth of a cup of the chunky hot sauce, and it
can't be loaded with spices and stabilizers, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture says. Massive criticism kept ketchup off the school
lunch vegetable list when that was proposed in 1981.

 &HT;    Volunteering: 10 ways you can help out
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Look around. It doesn't take Superman's X-ray vision
to see that not everyone is lucky enough to have a happy and
healthy family, plenty of food on the table and enough money to
make ends meet. In fact, many people in our society need help.
Fortunately, there are many good organizations that come to their
rescue. And those organizations depend on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering may not seem like a very good deal. After all, you
are giving something to someone else free of charge. But most
volunteers have found that what they give is paid back to them in
many ways. When you volunteer, you make new friends, expand your
horizons, develop leadership experience and learn new skills.
Sometimes, volunteering can even lead to a paying job. But most of
all, it gives you a good feeling inside _ just by knowing that you
helped someone who really needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are 6 or 16, there are many ways you can begin
volunteering this summer, whether you spend time with a needy
person or help out an arts organization. News for Kids rounds up
some of the best volunteer opportunities for youngsters:
</P>
<P>
   Help the hungry
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Community Food Bank is an amazing operation. It
distributes 1.5 million pounds of non-perishable food a month to
700 agencies that serve the hungry. They are looking for kids 8 or
older (anyone under 18 needs an adult chaperone) to help sort and
inspect the food, making sure it is safe to eat. You might look for
dents in cans or a hole in the potato chip bags, or _ yuck _ a
half-full jar of peanut butter that has an imprint of a spoon
someone has licked. Those get rejected. ``Kids have a blast, and
it's great for families or a summer camp project,'' says volunteer
program manager Kathleen Kelly. Call 404-892-3333, Ext. 229.
</P>
<P>
   Serve homeless kids
</P>
<P>
   Many kids must live in homeless shelters with their families.
The Atlanta Children's Shelter serves as a day care facility for
preschoolers (kids 5 and younger) while their parents work or look
for jobs. The shelter needs youngsters to play with the kids, read
stories, supervise arts and crafts, and serve snacks. You'll get a
good feeling when you enrich a youngster's life. Volunteer Tatianna
Troutman, a seventh-grader at Atlanta's Paideia School, says: ``I
like teaching the children new things, like their colors. At first
this little girl did not know the difference between green and
yellow, and now she does, because I taught her.'' Volunteers must
be 14 or older (younger if accompanied by a parent or other adult).
Call 404-892-3713.
</P>
<P>
   Be a buddy
</P>
<P>
   All kids need good role models such as a big brother or sister
they can look up to. The 22 service sites for Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of
Metro Atlanta need young people 12 and up to serve as mentors to
kids 6-11. Activities range from coaching sports to working with
computers. Call 404-527-7100.
</P>
<P>
   Feed sick people
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty bad when you're so sick you can't cook _ or earn
enough money to buy food. That's where Project Open Hand steps in.
Every day, the organization prepares and delivers two freshly
cooked meals a day to 550 people with AIDS or HIV-related
disabilities. The organization needs volunteers 15 and up to pack
up meals, as well as volunteers 17 and up to work in the kitchen.
Delivery routes are available to those 16 and older with a car,
drivers license and insurance. Call 404-872-2707.
</P>
<P>
   For animal lovers
</P>
<P>
   While you must be 18 to work directly with the animals at the
Atlanta Humane Society shelter, the city's oldest charitable
organization welcomes all creative fund-raising from kids of all
ages. For instance, one family donated $38 that it earned from a
lemonade and bake sale. And all are welcome to make pet toys or
even homemade dog biscuits (there's a special recipe available from
the Humane Society) to be sold in the gift shop at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Three 11-year-old Buckhead girls _ Ashley Jones, Tessa Morris
and Libby Spears _ raised $200 for the Humane Society from their
pet-sitting service.
</P>
<P>
   Explains Tessa, a student at the Westminster Schools: ``We
started the pet-sitting service because we really liked animals. We
wanted to buy a horse, but decided that was impossible, so we
decided to donate the money to the Humane Society to help
animals.'' It took the three girls a year and a half to raise the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Call 404-875-2600, Ext 234.
</P>
<P>
   Brighten up a senior citizen
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting young people together with senior citizens is an
incredible combination,'' says April Cooks, outreach coordinator
for the volunteer organization Hands On Atlanta. The elderly just
light up when kids are around, she says. Cooks has many projects
for youngsters _ from serving meals to just visiting. You must be
18 if unaccompanied by an adult, but kids as young as elementary
school level are welcome, if they have adult supervision. Call
404-872-2252, Ext. 33.
</P>
<P>
   Help the earth
</P>
<P>
   Litter is a serious problem in Georgia. It not only looks bad,
it also can be dangerous to health and safety. You can help create
a better environment by volunteering for DeKalb Clean and
Beautiful's monthly cleanups of streets, vacant lots and illegal
dumping spots all over the county. These beautification events are
held the third Saturday of every month. Volunteers also are needed
to plant flowers and trees and to mark storm drains to remind
people not to dump chemicals that pollute creeks and rivers. You
must be at least 12; adult supervision will be provided. Groups are
welcome. Call 404-371-2654. And there are plenty of similar
opportunities in other counties. To find the Keep America Beautiful
affiliate nearest you, call the information line of Keep Georgia
Beautiful: 1-888-657-1122
</P>
<P>
   Especially for bookworms
</P>
<P>
   One of the main ways Goodwill Industries raises money for its
job-training programs is through its annual used book sale, the
nation's largest. The enormous preparation for this sale goes on
year-round, and hundreds of volunteers are needed. Duties include
sorting thousands of donated books and magazines into categories,
and cleaning and pricing them. ``Kids love using the pricing
guns,'' says book department director Monique Huiet,``and enjoy
racing each other to see who can empty a bin of books and put them
in the right place the fastest.'' Goodwill can use unaccompanied
children 12 and up; under that age, adult supervision is required.
Families and groups (such as Scout troops) are welcome. Call
404-377-0441, Ext. 156.
</P>
<P>
   Stagestruck?
</P>
<P>
   There's much more to putting on a successful show than just
actors and scenery. The Academy Theatre gives high school students
a chance to participate behind the scenes. These volunteers help
with everything from tours to administrative tasks. Call
404-525-4111.
</P>
<P>
   Explore other cultures
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta International Museum introduces us to the cultures of
the world through art. Volunteers 15 and up are needed to serve as
tour guides, work in the gift shop and office, greet visitors, help
install exhibits and more. ``It's real fun and a great learning
experience,'' says volunteer coordinator Jane Arthur. Call
404-688-2467, Ext. 5.

 &HT;    With virus controlled, NBA retiree staying busy
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Almost seven years ago, Magic Johnson faced a battery
of cameras and announced his retirement from the NBA ``because of
the HIV virus I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he is remarkably robust by any definition of good health,
thanks to drugs that have been so successful that they have reduced
the virus to levels that cannot be detected. His wife and three
children are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's new TV show, ``The Magic Hour,'' is just one aspect of
a busy life:
</P>
<P>
   HIS HEALTH: While by no means cured, he owes the appearance of
remarkable health to a Spartan lifestyle and modern medicine. Like
many AIDS patients on these new medications, he takes a combination
of three drugs, one a protease inhibitor. Side effects can include
nausea, vomiting, headaches, backaches or gastrointestinal
problems. The drugs are expensive, costing $12,000 to $15,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   HIS MOVIE THEATERS: He's a partner in a joint venture with Sony
Theaters in Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta, with expansion plans
for nine more cities. In Atlanta, where he already has one
multiplex theater at Greenbriar Mall, the financing plans for a
second one, in south DeKalb County, drew criticism because of
concerns that public money would be used. But the plan, which was
approved by the DeKalb County Commission and will be implemented
through the DeKalb County Development Authority, provides financing
and interest rate incentives and uses funds from private investors.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS: Johnson recently became Starbucks'
first joint-venture partner, with a location in Los Angeles. He has
a joint venture with TGI Friday's, with plans to open restaurants
near his theaters. He also has formed California Urban Investment
Partners with the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
investing in commercial real estate. And he represents American
Express and Adolph Coors in TV ads. Recently, he joined Janet
Jackson and record industry executive Jheryl Busby in buying a
majority stake in Founders National Bank, California's only African
American-owned bank.

 &HT;    This is Nomar's World
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Pizza is a rather simple food to eat. Just pick it
up, take a bite and chew.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't work for Nomar Garciaparra of the Boston Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When Garciaparra was at Georgia Tech, he had a special way of
eating his pie. He would cut out the inside of a slice of pizza,
because he figured it was the hottest. He didn't want to burn his
mouth, you see.
</P>
<P>
   Quirky? No doubt about it. But that's Garciaparra, whose methods
sometimes border on paranoia and whose meticulous routine is one of
the reasons he has become one of the best shortstops in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he came in for our team banquet (this year), and
his buddies wanted to come out from California to see him,'' said
Danny Hall, who coached Garciaparra for one year at Tech. ``He told
them, `You guys can come out, but you can't change my routine.' He
likes things in order. He is one of those guys who has tremendous
concentration and stays with a routine day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who plays here tonight against the Braves in the
first of a three-game interleague series, changes nothing. He wore
the same cap all three years at Tech. He listens to the same music
on the way to the ballpark and takes the same route every day. When
he dresses, it's right sock, left sock, right sanitary sock, left
sanitary sock, right stirrup and so on. When he is at the plate, he
tugs on his batting gloves between pitches, taps his spikes in the
dirt. In the field, he will remove his glove, spit on his hands and
put the glove back on as the pitcher begins his windup. He wears
the same underwear _ ``He's got a pair with about two strands
left,'' said teammate Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Call it superstitious; call it a little nutty. Garciaparra calls
it ``a game of routines,'' adding, ``I have my routines, just like
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But while this may seem eccentric, it has made Garciaparra the
player he is today. He ran away with American League rookie of the
year honors last year after one of the best power seasons ever for
a shortstop. Garciaparra hit .278 with 30 homers and 96 RBIs.
Despite missing 17 games with a shoulder injury this year, he's
hitting .278 with seven homers and 35 RBIs. With seemingly endless
range, his defense can be magnificent. He rarely ever blows a
routine play.
</P>
<P>
   And Garciaparra, 24, has turned the rather caustic baseball city
of Boston giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to learn the game and be a great player,'' Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette said. ``(Ted) Williams was obsessive
in the way he approached the game. Yaz (Carl Yastrzemski) was.
(Jim) Rice was. Cal Ripken's the same way. There is comfort in
routine. There's a saying that practice doesn't make perfect, but
perfect practice makes perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be no more valuable shortstop in baseball. While Ken
Griffey Jr., Mark McGwire and Juan Gonzalez typically are named as
the game's best players, consider how important Garciaparra is to
his club: When he missed 17 games in May, the Red Sox were 7-10.
With Garciaparra in the lineup, Boston is 27-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's lived up to the expectations and then some,''
said Red Sox teammate Darren Bragg, who played with Garciaparra at
Tech. ``I think by the time he's done he could probably be one of
the best who has ever played, not just for the Red Sox, for all of
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Garciaparra prefers to keep a low profile. When
time allows, he will grant interviews, but he keeps his answers
short and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``No questions about statistics,'' he said before an interview.
``I don't like them. They don't tell the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he is questioned: ``I'm not better than anyone else,
and I don't think anybody's better than me. It's all opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   He also prefers not to talk about his new-found power. When he
arrived on the Georgia Tech campus in 1991, he weighed around 140
pounds. At 6-foot, 180 today, he's still not large by baseball
standards. But his strength comes from the weight room, where his
routines are relentless.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he pairs strength with remarkable baseball instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his junior year we went to play Florida State, and we were
facing Paul Wilson (the No. 1 overall pick by the Mets in the 1994
draft),'' Hall said. ``The Mets were out there to watch Wilson
pitch, and he was throwing 95 mph. He decided to start game with
slider, and Nomar hit the ball out. You can't fool him.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a strong competitive heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at Wichita State for the regionals (1994), and we had
to play twice on the championship day,'' Hall said. ``It was over
100 degrees out there, and Nomar totally dehydrated himself in the
first game. He was taken to the hospital to get (fluids replaced),
and we ended up starting (the second game) without him. I'm
thinking, 'We don't have our shortstop; we don't have our leadoff
hitter.' He then comes back and says to me, 'I'm ready to go.' I
pinch-hit him for Mike Sorrow, and he hits the first pitch out of
the park. I was coaching third base, and the home-plate umpire
looks at me and says, `I can't believe what I'm seeing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was recently at the College World Series when the coach at
Southern Maine approached him and told him a story about
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his two sons idolize Nomar,'' Hall said. ``He said
he was down in Fort Myers (where the Red Sox train) and had gone
over to visit the Red Sox spring training camp. A few minutes after
they are there, Nomar is playing catch with his oldest son. This
year, they go down to a game at Fenway, and the Red Sox are coming
off from the field from batting practice. Nomar looks and sees his
oldest son and yells, 'Hey, I know you.' He has only met this kid
once, and he starts talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Garciaparra left the field, the coach's youngest son
looked at his older brother and said: ``Wow, you know Nomar?''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be long before everyone knows Nomar.

   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. Last Friday I asked my 8th-graders to close
their books (Saroyan's, The Human Comedy) and define the word
(ITAL)dignity(END ITAL). For a long few seconds, nothing happened.
Then Johnny went for a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity,'' he read as he stood in front of the class making
like an orator of old (being the class ham), ``bearing, conduct, or
speech indicative of self-respect. Nobility or elevation of
character.'' Satisfied with his performance, Johnny sat.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen puzzled faces focused on me, waiting for the other shoe
to drop. They've come to expect a method to my apparent madness.
``Who has some?'' I ask as I swivel my chair for emphasis. No
takers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ellen asks the obvious: ``Some what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity. How many of you respect yourselves?'' Brows knit in
obvious concentration, but no one answers. I wait for them to mull
it over. I know that if one of them takes the initiative, the
others will follow. Fourteen is an insecure age.
</P>
<P>
   After what seems an eternity, Jenny tentatively raises her hand.
``Sometimes I think I have some,'' she begins, apparently uneasy
with being the first to speak, ``but then something wrecks it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some(ITAL)thing(END ITAL),'' I ask, ``or some(ITAL)body(END
ITAL)?''
</P>
<P>
   While Jenny's thinking that one over, Bobby picks up: ``Parents
wreck our dignity. The other night I was helping my dad rototill
the garden and I messed up. He called me stupid. That hurts a kid's
self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy agrees. ``My sister calls me stupid all of the time, but
that doesn't bother me because I know she hates me. But parents
shouldn't call their kids names. They're supposed to love us. All's
I know is (I cringe but now's not the time for a grammar lesson)
I'm never going to call my kids ``dumb'' or ``stupid'' because it
really hurts our feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Patty wants into the discussion. ``Kids wreck each other's
self-respect. We call each other names all of the time.'' I nod,
recalling voices I've heard in the hall raised in less than praise.
``Stupid!'' ``Faggot!'' ``Pervert!'' are three of their favorites.
Worst of all, many of the kids who use them aren't even sure of the
meaning of the truly tasteless terms they're mouthing. A few days
earlier I'd hauled Benny and Art into my room for just such a
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you call Art a faggot?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he acts stupid,'' he grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faggot is a derogatory term for a homosexual. Are you offended
because Art is gay?'' Art choked and denied any such proclivities.
Benny had the decency to blush and admit that wasn't what he meant
at all. He said he had been annoyed because Art had been paying
attention to Susie in study hall and she was Benny's girlfriend. I
asked if calling Art a faggot in this case, might not have been a
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   Benny scrutinized his shoe-tops and admitted, ``Yeah, I guess.''
I ask him what he might have said to Art instead of calling him a
name. He was stumped for an answer. Art asked Benny why he didn't
just come up and ask him if he was out to steal his girlfriend.
Says if he had, he would have explained that his sister wanted him
to ask Susie if she was going to be riding the bus home that
afternoon so she could return some gym shorts she'd borrowed from
her. Benny still studied his Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do others have to respect us before we can respect
ourselves?'' I ask of no one in particular. Quite a few say yes,
and that if others don't treat them well they feel really down on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't respect yourselves first, how is anyone else
going to do it for you?'' I ask. Teddy wants to know why he should
respect himself. That's the opening I was looking for. I direct my
questions to the entire class, asking them not to answer aloud, but
just to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you earn your own grades or do you sit for a quiz with the
answers written all over your sneakers?'' A couple of giggles. They
think teachers don't notice stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you tell the truth, even when it means you'll have to pay
the consequences? Do you compliment instead of criticize? Do you
encourage rather than belittle? Do you listen more often than you
talk? Do you avoid gossip? Do you dress like you're proud of
yourself? Do you choose friends for ``quality'' rather than for
``cool''? and do you more often think about what you can do for
that friend rather than what he or she can do for you?''
</P>
<P>
   They're looking a bit bored, and I'm beginning to think maybe
I'm whistling in the wind - again. Saved by the bell.
</P>
<P>
   But as they storm out the door, Sandy slows down long enough to
add a postscript: ``It just hurts more when grown-ups call us dumb
and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Shame on us.

Cup runneth over with security folk
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Dale Robertson
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ They are hard-looking young men with tense jaws and
erect posture, dressed in navy-blue jumpsuits with a ``CRS,
Nationale Police'' patch on the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they can be seen everywhere, these Compagnie
Rpublicaine de Scurit foot soldiers. And while their only visible
weapons are a glare, a long black billy club and what appear to be
steel-toed jackboots, they are not to be trifled with. I find
myself practically tiptoeing in their presence, because they have
been trained to assume guilt, not innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In their minds, if you exist, you are plotting something. These
dudes are tougher than the Paris waiters.
</P>
<P>
   The latter group notwithstanding, the French have bravely
promised unprecedented hospitality for the Coupe du Monde, the
Super Bowl for the rest of the world that starts Wednesday
afternoon at the new Stade du France, an I.M. Pei-designed marvel
in the gritty northern suburb of Saint-Denis. But they have also
flat-out guaranteed unprecedented levels of security.
</P>
<P>
   With England's notorious soccer rowdies just a Chunnel ride
away, and the Islamic crazies from Algeria plotting more heinous
crimes against humanity as we speak despite being busted recently
in a major pre-emptive strike, nothing is being left to chance. One
hundred million francs have been spent by World Cup organizers,
with the government putting up a couple of billion more.
</P>
<P>
   But one should beware of pickpockets anyway. They're good here,
really good.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the world go by
</P>
<P>
   The technology in the Stade, where the championship game will be
July 12, is such that hidden cameras can focus on every one of the
80,000 faces in the stands and print out an instant mug shot. So if
you're lucky enough to have a ticket, remember not to be with
someone you're not supposed to be with, and by all means don't pick
your nose.
</P>
<P>
   In Marseilles, where the English and the Tunisians tangle, Big
Brother will be watching especially closely. There, the lgion
trangre _ yes, the beau geste bunch, the French Foreign Legion _
has been charged with keeping the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Already, they are not happy campers. Marching through Charles de
Gaulle Airport in full combat gear upon their arrival, the
Legionnaires roughed up several tourists, confiscating the cameras
of those who innocently tried to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They resent being reduced to the role of policemen at the
World Cup,'' a Parisian journalist, Jean-Claude Ariel, said. ``They
are ruthless mercenaries whose job is war. There is great anger in
France that they will be heavily involved in what is supposed to be
a sporting carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the type of men you should ask for directions to
the nearest lavatory. Avoid eye contact with them, if possible. And
do not take photographs. In all probability, they are wanted by the
police in their own countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   But in our world, security must be an overriding concern.
France, the most visited country on the planet on a per-capita
basis (tourists to residents), will be overrun by an extra 2.5
million soccer-crazy partisans in the weeks ahead, and some of them
will be from places where fomentation is the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Fans might rail over rail
</P>
<P>
   Iran, the U.S. team's opponent in Lyon on June 21, comes quickly
to mind. But the Iranians who have tickets should be a docile
bunch. The vast majority of them are government functionaries who
had a well-placed brother-in-law or cousin, and they are mad only
about their soccer lads.
</P>
<P>
   At Iran's tourist office on the Champs Elyses, a giant
photograph of the country's superstar, Ali Daei, has been pasted
above the door. The Great Satan became a back-burner concern the
moment the Iranians qualified _ last in the field of 32 _ with a
final-minute goal in their final match.
</P>
<P>
   Because few soccer fans will wind up on Alpine peaks or in
backwoods hostelries, the potential for chaos in the nine cities
hosting competition (two Paris-area stadiums are being used) is
huge. Nothing ruins the global-village, hands-across-the-water
ideal quicker than a bomb in a trash container or, almost as bad, a
sudden rail strike.

   France's transportation-sector employees were made to sign blood
oaths to be kind to tourists, but the contract didn't include a
no-walkout promise. So Paris Metro workers and those of the RER
(regional) and SNCF (national) railways have staged halfhearted _
but ominous _ work stoppages in support of their proletarian
brothers, the striking Air France pilots.

   If there is carnage during the World Cup, chances are it won't
have political overtones. The worst riots will be caused by
hysterical fans who have been told the soccer express to
Saint-Etienne or Toulouse has been canceled and they're going to
miss their nation's game.

CONE'S TWO-HITTER PACES YANKEES OVER MARLINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Relief in the late innings is standard operating
procedure for the post-operative David Cone, and predictably, the
phone rang in the New York Yankees' bullpen in the sixth inning
Sunday. Graeme Lloyd got up after Cone hit one batter and walked
another, but when Cone retired Florida's Mark Kotsay, Lloyd sat
down without throwing a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees relievers kept popping up in the bullpen over the next
three innings, like in a carnival game, but they would sit back
down when Cone continued to get outs, including the last. Cone
allowed two hits, struck out 14 batters and pitched his first
complete game since May 2, 1996, in beating the Florida Marlins 4-1
before 47,731 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Marlins are inhabiting opposite ends of baseball
at the moment. The Yankees have won seven straight games and 43 of
their last 52, and they are 44-13 over all; at this rate, they
would finish 125-37. The Marlins, the champions of baseball last
season, have lost 11 straight, and at this rate they would win 45
and lose 117. The Marlins began play Sunday 25 games behind the
Atlanta Braves in the NL East; according to the Elias Sports
Bureau, the last team to be that far behind after 60 games was the
1962 New York Mets, arguably the worst team ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strikeouts Cone generated Sunday could be directly
attributed to the inexperience of the Florida hitters. He would
throw a first-pitch strike and many of the Marlins seemed to have
no idea what to expect thereafter. ``He basically just overmatched
some of our young guys,'' said Jim Leyland, the Florida manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone, who has won all eight of his decisions since losing
his first on April 4, would have been highly effective against any
team. Fresh from eight days of rest, he threw hard, he had good
control _ improvement, Yankees manager Joe Torre said, that had
been evident in his last start, before his mother's Jack Russell
terrier bit him on the right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was often erratic in his first nine starts. But there was
one consistent aspect to his pitching: his slider spun down and
away from right-handed hitters, six inches to a foot off the
outside edge of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely did umpires call it for strikes, and Cone was not casting
the pitch close enough to home plate to tempt hitters into
swinging. His slider, which has been his best pitch in recent
years, had lost its value. There had to be a way he could throw it
more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cone's start against Boston on May 29, Mel Stottlemyre,
the Yankees' pitching coach, suggested that Cone change his
position on the pitching rubber. Rather than throw from the extreme
first-base side, Cone moved to the middle of the rubber; in effect,
he was moving his own target area about six inches _ giving himself
a better chance of hitting the strike zone, or at least violating
its personal space. A small, elementary adjustment, with a major
impact. ``It's really helped me a lot,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   And with control of his slider and fastball, Cone was able to
expand the strike zone a bit, ``for the first time this season,''
he said. Cone threw to the fringes of the strike zone against the
Marlins; because he was consistent in doing this, it appeared that
by game's end, Tim Welke, the home-plate umpire, called strikes on
pitches just a bit outside.
</P>
<P>
   On five occasions, Cone got called third strikes on sliders _
pitches that sliced the edge of the strike zone. ``He taught us a
lesson today,'' said Mark Kotsay, Florida's right fielder, who
twice was called out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After Veronica, his mother's dog, bit his hand, Cone fretted
about the effect the cut would have on his split-fingered fastball,
a pitch that requires pressure from his index finger. Catcher Joe
Girardi called for only one splitter in the first six innings, but
in the seventh, with the end in sight, Cone started throwing the
pitch _ one more thing for the Marlins' hitters to worry about.
Cone whiffed two in the seventh, to reach 10.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams all had homered
in the early innings, and the Yankees led by 4-0 as Cone took the
mound for the eighth. He struck out three more in the inning, but
lost the shutout on a booming double. Torre intended to call on a
reliever for the ninth, before Cone told him he wanted to throw the
last inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' said Torre, telling Cone that he would be replaced if
one batter reached base. Cone struck out Kotsay _ No. 14 _ and
retired the final two hitters, before happily hugging Girardi and
accepting congratulations from the many relievers who were not
needed, after all.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   With his home run in the first inning, Paul O'Neill extended his
hitting streak to 15 games, the longest by a Yankee this season.
... O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams all homered, the
first time this season the Yankees' 3-4-5 hitters had hit home runs
in the same game and only the second time any two of them hit
homers in the same game. ... The Yankees have either won or tied
their last 22 series, extending the franchise record. It is the
most since the 1970 Cincinnati Reds won or tied 24 consecutive
series.

COMMENTARY: THE GRAND INQUISITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Kenneth Starr has his way, any American who consults a lawyer
from now on will face the possibility that after his or her death
the lawyer will be forced to testify about the conversation in
federal criminal proceedings. The confidential character of the
lawyer-client relationship will end.
</P>
<P>
   That is the position taken by Starr in a case being argued in
the Supreme Court on Monday. He wants to see three pages of
handwritten notes that were taken by a Washington lawyer, James
Hamilton, when Vincent Foster came to see him in 1993. Foster,
assistant White House counsel, was suffering from severe
depression. Nine days later he committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   No federal prosecutor before Starr has made that claim. A
divided U.S. Court of Appeals held in this case that the
lawyer-client privilege could be overridden if a trial judge found
that a lawyer's evidence about a deceased client was likely to be
substantial and unavailable elsewhere. But Starr, unsatisfied with
that balancing of interests, asks the Supreme Court to hold that
the privilege always ends with death.
</P>
<P>
   In support of that extreme position he makes an even more
extreme argument. The only person who would be troubled by the
prospect of discussions with a lawyer being disclosed after death,
he says, is someone who plans to commit perjury. The legal argument
against forced disclosure, he says in his brief, ``is acrid with
the odor of presumed perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   But a truthful person may want to speak in confidence to a
lawyer. The criminal law is so full of traps for the unwary these
days that anyone even tangentially concerned would be a fool not
to. The discussion may well include the client's suspicions about
others that he would not want published after his death. And he
might care about his own posthumous reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of later disclosure may lead an honest person to keep
things back from a lawyer _ to be less than candid. The
lawyer-client privilege is rooted deeply in our law precisely
because it encourages the client to speak candidly and enables the
lawyer to give meaningful advice.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that only perjurers would want the privilege to
continue after death is reminiscent of one made by the Red-baiters
of the 1950s. Sen. Joe McCarthy and others called anyone who
invoked the privilege against forced self-incrimination a ``Fifth
Amendment communist.'' It took a staunch conservative, Dean Erwin
Griswold of the Harvard Law School, to explain that the privilege
was there to protect the innocent as well as the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's position in the Foster privilege case is not a solitary
example of extremism. As independent counsel he has repeatedly
pressed at and beyond the edge of appropriate prosecutorial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One tactic he uses is to call people before the grand jury again
and again. Betty Currie, President Clinton's secretary, is one
victim of that practice, which reeks of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the notorious treatment of Susan McDougal. After
she served 18 months in prison for civil contempt for refusing, she
says, to testify as Starr wanted, he paraded her in chains one more
time and had her indicted for criminal contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Most troublesome of all is Starr's penchant for imagining, and
investigating, plots against his inquiry. A man who urged
prosecution of Linda Tripp for violating Maryland law when she
tape-recorded her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky was
called before Starr's grand jury. So was a Pentagon official, to be
questioned about the disclosure that Ms. Tripp had omitted from a
Pentagon security form the fact that she was once arrested for
grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who resists Starr's overreaching is likely to be
denounced for delaying the investigation or obstructing justice.
Too much of the press voices such criticism, unable to see the
dangers of a prosecutor with no restraints of time or money.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants to win: to bring down President Clinton. That
obsession led him last week to the folly of telling the Supreme
Court that the country urgently needed expedited review of another
of his cases: a threadbare claim. The court, one institution that
does not dance to his tune, said no.
</P>
<P>
   The point, now as in the McCarthy days, is to remember the
larger interest: our interest in liberty and privacy. It is not
just Bill Clinton who will lose if Kenneth Starr truncates the
lawyer-client privilege. We all will.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY GAVE BIG TO PARTIES IN STATES WHERE IT FACED

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida sued the tobacco
industry in early 1995, he ignited a legal and political war that
raged for the next three years. During the course of the lawsuit to
recoup smoking-related health costs, which culminated in an $11.3
billion settlement last summer, tobacco interests poured more than
$1 million into the state, most of it going to political opponents
of the governor, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the tobacco industry has contributed $592,000 to the
Florida Republican Party, more than twice what it gave to Florida
Democrats. The industry also sprinkled an additional $338,244 among
friendly state legislators and other Florida political groups, many
of whom opposed the state's lawsuit and tried unsuccessfully to
derail it.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers' heavy contributions in Florida are part of a
national mosaic, according to an analysis of state party financial
records conducted for The New York Times by the Campaign Study
Group, a private research firm. Since 1995, when many states joined
Florida in filing lawsuits against the tobacco industry, Republican
and Democratic state party central committees in 26 states,
including Florida, have received $1.8 million in donations from
tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate considers comprehensive tobacco legislation at the
federal level, attention has focused on the big donations from the
five major tobacco companies and a few other tobacco industry
supporters to the Republican National Committee and various
Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But scant attention has been paid to the industry's donations at
the state level, in part because these contributions are much
harder to track. The state parties have varying disclosure
requirements. Contributions to federal candidates are disclosed
several times a year to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 million in tobacco contributions to the state parties
is important in light of legislation being debated in the House of
Representatives to ban corporate and labor union contributions to
the national parties. If such legislation is enacted, other
industries could follow the tobacco manufacturers' lead and begin
contributing much larger amounts to state parties. Many states
allow unlimited contributions to a state party.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign Study Group analyzed the election records of the
state party central committees in every state. In addition to the
donations from tobacco interests to the state Democratic and
Republican Parties, the study found an additional $1.7 million in
contributions since 1995 to state candidates and other committees
in four states that make complete campaign finance data for
candidates and other state parties readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Given the less specific disclosure rules in the other states, it
is almost impossible to determine the total contributions to
individual state candidates, but campaign finance analysts believe
that cigarette makers, as well as other industries, are giving huge
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the analysis of the tobacco industry's state-level
political contributions, one cigarette maker, the Philip Morris
Cos., accounted for 62 percent of the $1.8 million given by tobacco
interests to the state parties. And 70 percent of the $1.8 million
went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The big tobacco companies have donated more money at the federal
level, contributing nearly $4 million to the Republican National
Committee and $325,000 to the Democratic National Committee since
1995. The state party contributions are significant because they
came at a time when the tobacco industry was trying to slow a legal
juggernaut that began when the Democratic attorney general of
Mississippi filed a lawsuit in 1994 to recover smoking-related
Medicaid costs from the big tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, some 40 other states sued the cigarette makers.
These lawsuits led to last year's historic $368.5 billion
settlement between a group of state attorneys general and the
tobacco industry. But the settlement is subject to approval by the
Congress. Comprehensive tobacco legislation introduced in the
Senate has faced stiff opposition and prospects in the House are
also cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies thought it couldn't hurt to cultivate
states where they had tough attorneys general,'' said William
Novelli of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, an anti-smoking
organization based in Washington. ``They were trying to cultivate
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 states in which the tobacco industry donated funds to
state party central committees, nearly half went to Florida. The
next largest donations went to New York, where the Republican state
committee received $254,100 and the Democrats received $5,000 &UR; , and
Washington State where the Republicans  &LR; got &UR; $121,000 and the
Democrats  &LR; received  &UR; nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 states receiving  &LR; the b &UR; ulk &LR;  of  &UR; the tobacco
donations, Republican committeesreceived more than the Democrats in
all but two. In Missouri, the Democratic committee received $96,500
and the Republicans received $41,000. In Nebraska, the Democrats
got $20,000 white the Republicans received nothing. In the 15 other
states, the parties received less than $10,000 each.  &LR;  The tobacco
companies say their state-level contributions were not intended to
blunt lawsuits but to support local, pro-business candidates and
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many corporations, Philip Morris presents its views on
issues and supports people who think along similar lines,'' said
Darienne Dennis, the company's communications director. ``Philip
Morris is an active citizen participating in the political process
by expressing its views on a wide variety of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
Corp., a subsidiary of BAT Industries, said of the contributions,
``It's generally to support pro-business activities and candidates
and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, however, the contributions have been viewed
differently by industry critics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a war,'' said April Herrle, communications
director for Chiles. ``It's the governor versus Big Tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled state legislature attempted several
times to repeal a Chiles-sponsored law that permitted the state's
lawsuit against the cigarette makers. ``It's clear that Republicans
have been carrying the water of Big Tobacco and they've been paid
handsomely to do it,'' Ms. Herrle said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sparks, a spokesman for the Florida Republican Party, said
state Republicans welcomed contributions from ``anyone who's
interested in good government or a legitimate business.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco contributions in Florida have become an issue in the
coming gubernatorial contest between the likely Democratic
candidate, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, and the likely Republican
candidate, Jeb Bush. Bush's campaign has called MacKay a hypocrite
for portraying himself as an anti-tobacco crusader who eschews
tobacco donations, while the state's Democratic Party took in
$25,000 in 1998 from tobacco interests. Republicans received
$42,000 from tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quick to criticize the GOP for taking tobacco money,''
said Sally Harrell, Bush's campaign manager. ``But he needs to look
inside his own closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kucera, MacKay's press secretary, said the tobacco
industry's contributions to the Democratic Party had nothing to do
with MacKay. ``Buddy MacKay has worked hard to make sure the
tobacco special interests should not have undue influence on the
political process,'' Ms. Kucera said. She stressed that Bush
originally opposed Florida's lawsuit against the cigarette
companies and said he was beholden to tobacco interests. Bush's
campaign and a nonprofit foundation of which he is chairman have
received tobacco support.
</P>
<P>
   To Ralph Devitto, the Florida lobbyist for the American Cancer
Society, the contributions are part of a broad effort by the
tobacco industry to strengthen its political clout in the state.
``Clearly, the tobacco companies are trying to continue to have a
voice in this state and they can make contributions at levels that
are huge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's relatively strict election laws limit candidates to
$500 donations from contributors. But the state political parties
can accept unlimited donations.
</P>
<P>
   While the state lawsuits have been an important concern, there
are other issues at the state level that are critical to tobacco,
including excise taxes and local anti-smoking ordinances. But some
recipients of tobacco industry money said the contributions were
not tied to particular issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get contributions from many people who are pleased with the
way New York is going,'' said Terry O'Brien, a spokesman for the
New York Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some industries contribute to the state parties because their
donations are sometimes controversial and state-level donations are
less noticed than federal contributions. Gambling and alcohol
interests also contributed heavily to the state parties. In 1996,
the Democratic National Committee directed several tobacco and
gaming companies to make their donations to state Democratic
parties instead of to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with prospects clouded for federal legislation to enact
the historic settlement reached last year between the cigarette
makers and the states, the pro-tobacco forces may need their allies
at the state level more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry may thwart legislation at the federal
level,'' Novelli said. ``So they are planning what comes next when
you have to go back to the trenches. And the trenches are the
states.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN'S DECISION MAY BE IN HANDS OF HIS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As the Chicago Bulls play the Utah Jazz in the NBA
Finals, a series that some speculate may be Michael Jordan's Last
Games, Last Dance, Last Stand (would one of Jordan's last meals
then be the Last Repast?), it would be helpful to consider the
circumstances surrounding the possible grounding of His Airness.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the Bulls' coach, Phil Jackson, is the key to Jordan's
basketball-playing future. And by extension, the Bulls' management
has been perceived as that which holds the hand that holds the key.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Jordan has said, and then seemingly hedged, that
he would not return to the Bulls _ the only team he said he would
consider playing for _ if Jackson was not the coach. Jackson was
the bench leader behind all the Bulls' five championships.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has coyly left the impression that he may not go
voluntarily into that good night, and that the Bulls' management,
like the proprietor of a vaudeville stage, might just be applying a
hook, although circumspectly. That is, no Jackson, no Jordan.
Jordan is not alone in this intimation. Phil Jackson has indirectly
also allowed the idea to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has repeatedly stated publicly that this would be his
last season. And why would this be Jackson's last season? Because,
it is generally believed, Bulls management wants it that way, and
is pushing Jackson out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' Jackson said recently, ``that when I signed this
last contract, Jerry Krause said that this would be my last
season.'' Krause is the vice president in charge of basketball
operations for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Jackson indeed signed a one-year contract _ but he
had been offered a five-year contract, then a two-year contract,
and turned them down for the one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jerry Krause did,'' said Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the
Bulls, ``was only repeat what Phil Jackson had been saying. In
fact, several times in the last year I've asked Phil if he wants to
come back. And every time he has said to me, no.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Jackson and Krause _ the man who hired him _ no
longer have any love lost for each other. ``I'm not really sure
what the problem is, but I think Krause thinks I've gotten a big
head,'' Jackson said. Krause won't comment on the acrimonious
relationship other than to say, ``I'm going to take the high road _
there's no traffic up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Krause speak only when necessary, such as when
deciding and agreeing on a trade, like that of Jason Caffey. About
two years ago, Jackson went to Reinsdorf and said the situation
with Krause was becoming untenable. ``Do you think you can work
well enough with Jerry to win a championship?'' Reinsdorf asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll leave things as they are,'' Reinsdorf decided.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is not wrong in believing that Krause wants him out, and
has compared the situation to the one with the Los Angeles Lakers
in the 1980s in which Jerry West's personality clash with Pat Riley
resulted in Riley's departure as coach. ``But Jerry Reinsdorf is
not pushing me out,'' Jackson said. And, he was asked, if Reinsdorf
wanted you to stay, do you think you would be able to stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Jackson said. ``Reinsdorf is the bottom line, and
Krause would listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf said, ``Phil has done a great job for us, and if he
changes his mind and wants to come back, I'll be open to discussing
it with him, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be necessary to know, among other points, whether
Jackson would want to be involved in rebuilding the Bulls, perhaps
the oldest team in the league. Jackson has suggested he would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every seven years the molecular components of the body
change,'' Jackson said, in his Zen-like mode. ``And I've been the
Bulls' coach for more than seven years now, and I'm a person going
through changes.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Jordan, who went from basketball to baseball to basketball
to, well, golf? ``I'm not sure even Michael knows at this time,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But like the ghost of Banquo, the notion hovers that in a matter
of a fortnight, Jordan will be gone forever from the hardwood
scene, depriving a city, a nation and large pockets of the rest of
the earth, the moon and the stars the pleasure of his basketball
genius. It is a genius still wondrous, though, older and achier, he
is no longer first in flight.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jordan is relying on the Jackson outcome, then it seems
safe to say that the decision is Jackson's, because it is
Reinsdorf's.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Alejandra Barrales Magdaleno's views about unions
and labor were forged while she was flying into U.S. cities as a
$700-a-month Aeromexico flight attendant, often alongside those
from U.S. airlines whose salaries were four times as high.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the leader of Mexico's 2,000-member flight attendants
union, Ms. Barrales symbolizes the more independent and vigorous
labor movement emerging here a year after the death of Fidel
Velazquez, the union czar who kept workers submissive for decades.
</P>
<P>
   With Mexico's economy strengthening after years of crisis, Ms.
Barrales brought to a modestly successful conclusion on Saturday
evening the first nationwide strike by one of the politically
independent unions that formed a new federation last year. These
unions are an important element in Mexico's democratic transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike strengthened not just our union but the entire
workers' movement,'' Ms. Barrales told hundreds of cheering flight
attendants in an assembly that approved a new salary and benefits
package by a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast could hardly be more dramatic between Velazquez,
who was anti-communist, anti-American and _ when he died last year
at the age of 97 _ antediluvian, and Ms. Barrales, who is 30 years
old, politically independent, and an admirer of the U.S., Canadian
and European labor movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an impressive, dynamic new leader,'' said John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO, who has met her to discuss new alliances
among North American unions. ``She's the kind of new labor
leadership we're seeing in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now fewer strikes in Mexico because so many have been
crushed. In fact, the government helped management during the
flight attendants' strike by seizing control of the airline to keep
planes flying.
</P>
<P>
   But during a week of picketing and negotiations, Ms. Barrales
marshaled middle-class support and focused international pressure
on management, finally wringing modest salary increases and new
benefits from the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mexican workers' reputation for being among the world's
most long-suffering, the outcome suggests that after nearly two
decades of falling wages, some at least want to lodge more
aggressive demands.
</P>
<P>
   Graciela Bensusan, an academic who studies the labor movement
here, said that during years of economic turmoil, strikes have
declined dramatically _ from 675 in 1982 to 39 last year _ partly
because ``workers have been willing to accept huge salary cuts to
save their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike is emblematic,'' she said, ``because it shows that
now some workers are willing to return to mobilizations as a way to
improve working conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Workers Confederation _ known by its initials in
Spanish, CTM _ which Velazquez headed, is still Mexico's largest
labor body by far, representing some 10 million workers. But last
year Ms. Barrales helped found a rival federation, the National
Workers Union, which now represents some 1.5 million members and
appears to be growing fast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Francisco Hernandez Juarez, the leader of the telephone workers
union, is president of the new federation. ``Mexico's labor system
was designed for control,'' he said in an interview. ``The unions
were taken from the workers and given to labor leaders who work
with the government and the company owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders get rich, and the government and owners use the
unions to impose economic programs and to keep labor costs low. We
think it's time to even things out. We want Mexico to compete and
grow, but people can't eat macroeconomic indicators. They need
better salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first decades after Velazquez helped forge the
postrevolutionary labor movement in the 1930s and 1940s, his
official federation, which forms one wing of the long-governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won important
improvements in wages and working conditions in exchange for
turning out the vote on election day.
</P>
<P>
   But after 1982, the year of a watershed debt crisis, Velazquez's
official unions worked mainly to discipline workers into tightening
their belts as inflation and devaluations cut into real wages.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Weintraub, an economist at Georgetown University's Center
for Strategic and International Studies, cited government
statistics in a recent article outlining the extraordinary erosion
of Mexican wages. In 1980, he said, Mexican manufacturing workers
earned 22 percent of what their U.S. counterparts earned. By 1996,
Mexican wages had fallen to 8 percent of U.S. wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few groups of workers have felt this decline more painfully than
the country's airline employees. In the wake of a 1988
privatization, two-thirds of Aeromexico's 12,000-member work force
were eliminated, and workers who managed to keep their jobs lost
pensions, seniority rights and virtually every other benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get help from the union,'' recalled Ms. Barrales,
who was 21 years old and had been flying with Aeromexico for two
years at the time of the privatization. ``But there was no
strength, no support, and we had to begin again at zero.''
</P>
<P>
   If some Aeromexico workers viewed the sacrifices as an
investment in the company's future, the altruism soured in 1994,
when Aeromexico's high-flying chief executive suddenly fled Mexico
after government accusations that he had embezzled $72 million from
the airline. He, in turn, through his lawyers, accused PRI
officials of shaking the airline down for $8 million in
election-year contributions even as the company was sliding into
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Barrales was elected president of her union in 1995,
she has been watching Aeromexico's balance sheets, which have been
improving. She said the company earned nearly $100 million in
profits last year. An Aeromexico spokesman declined to divulge the
official figure.
</P>
<P>
   Before the strike, Aeromexico's most senior flight attendants
earned about $7,400 a year, compared with about $42,000 on U.S.
airlines, according to union statistics. Saturday's agreement will
raise salaries by 18 percent and establish a retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more unions ready to defend workers'
interests,'' Ms. Barrales said.

TRAIN BLAST KILLS 23 AND PAKISTAN BLAMES INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ A bomb exploded Sunday morning on a
crowded railroad train in southern Pakistan, killing 23 people, and
the government immediately blamed Indian secret agents.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred a little after 4 a.m. near Khairpur, in
the southern province of Sindh, as the Khyber Mail train was making
its run from Karachi to Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   The blast went off under a seat in the middle of a crowded
economy-class passenger car, wounding about 32 people in addition
to the 23 who were killed, Pakistan Railway officials said. The
dead included four women and two children
</P>
<P>
   ``The bomb blast on the Khyber Mail today is an abominable
RAW-sponsored terrorist act,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said,
using the initials of the Indian intelligence organization, the
Research and Analysis Wing. ``We condemn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani Minister of Information Mushahid Hussain said his
government would provide ``hard proof'' of Indian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Foreign Ministry, in a brief statement late Sunday,
said, ``The reported statement of the Pakistan information minister
regarding India's alleged involvement in the unfortunate train
blasts in Sindh province of Pakistan are baseless and false,''
Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad's general manager, Naseer Alvi, said the explosion
was a case of ``clear sabotage.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion and the swift Pakistani reaction appeared likely
to increase tensions between the two countries _ longtime enemies
that have just stunned the world by setting off rival nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Each has blamed the intelligence services of the other for
planting bombs and stirring up trouble among the region's many
fractious religious and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain, Pakistan's information minister, said the government
had an Indian agent in custody who had been captured near the
Indian border. He said the Indian had confessed to similar acts of
terrorism, including 10 bombings in a 9-week period this year that
resulted in 16 deaths and that wounded another 93 people.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested, too, that a bombing earlier this week in a movie
theater in Lahore, which killed three people and wrecked the
theater, was part of an Indian-sponsored series of terrorist acts.
He said the main suspect was an Indian citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, on a tour of Persian
Gulf emirates and Saudi Arabia in hopes of garnering financial
support in the face of impending sanctions, announced plans to
visit Britain, Canada and the United States in an effort to build
support among Pakistani expatriots. He is scheduled to be in New
York on June 16. Money sent home by Pakistanis working abroad is
one of the main sources of income in the country's beleaguered
economy.

ARMSTRONG DELIVERS FOR HINCAPIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A year ago, soon after the First Union U.S.
professional cycling championship, there were tears for George
Hincapie and his family _ tears of sorrow. Sunday, there were tears
again _ tears of joy _ as the 24-year-old New York native finally
won the national championship he thought he had captured last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic finish to a 156-mile circuit race through streets
and parks that had the pack flying at almost 45 miles an hour at
the end, Hincapie started sprinting with about 270 yards to go. He
won by 2 feet, the width of a bike wheel. Massimiliano Mori and the
Saeco-Cannondale team of Italy was second and Tomas Konecny of the
Czech Republic and the ZVVZ-Giant team was third.
</P>
<P>
   As Hincapie raised his arms in triumph, the family tears started
to flow. Martha Hincapie screamed and grabbed her husband,
Colombian-born Ricardo Hincapie, who still races bikes at age 55.
As their daughter, Clara, said, ``We went crazy. We wanted this so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after last year. George Hincapie came in third here,
behind an Italian and an Australian. As the first American
finisher, he became the national champion. On the victory podium,
he was given a national champion's stars-and-stripes jersey and a
bouquet. And it was Father's Day, and Ricardo Hincapie had the gift
he wanted most.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty minutes later, when they returned to their hotel, the
phone rang with awful news: officials said Hincapie's team car had
illegally led him back to the pack after he had a flat tire. They
disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not revenge,'' Hincapie said. ``Last year was devastating for
me, but a professional cyclist has to go on. This is the first race
I've won all year. It was amazing, like a moment in outer space. In
the last 50 meters, you hear nothing, you feel nothing. You're in
the twilight zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also the high-rent zone because the $120,160 overall purse (with
$30,000 to the winner) makes this the world's richest one-day bike
race. The first 31 finishers were given the same time _ 6 hours 6
minutes 35 seconds, or 25.53 miles per hour. Of the 103 starters,
66 finished.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie is 6 feet 3 inches and 185 pounds. He is a fifth-year
pro who got his first bike at age 8 and promptly won a BMX race. He
was born in Richmond Hill, N.Y., and at age 11 moved to
Farmingdale, N.Y. He now lives in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   He rides for the U.S. Postal Service team, where his teammates
include Lance Armstrong and Frankie Andreu, who were on his first
pro team, Motorola. When Armstrong was healthy, Hincapie and Andreu
comprised his support group. Now, 20 months after Armstrong
underwent extensive surgery for testicular cancer that had spread
to his abdomen and brain, he has been riding for them.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong kept the race honest. After five others had broken
away early and stayed in front for 90 miles and almost four hours,
he led the chase that reeled them in. With 16 miles to go, he led
the race. With seven miles to go, he led the race.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he pushed the pace, ran down breaks and helped lead
Hincapie through the pack to a position where Hincapie could win.
Armstrong finished 33rd, 19 seconds behind Hincapie. But as an
ultimate team player in this ultimate team sport, Armstrong was a
winner. After the race, he was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly hard,'' he said. ``I'm totally burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gorski, the director of the Postal Service team, said
Hincapie could not have won without Armstriong's heroics.
``Everything Lance did today, he knew it was not for himself, but
for George,'' Gorski said. ``His unselfishness was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   SHIFTING GEARS:
</P>
<P>
   Petra Rossner, a 31-year-old German who rides for the
Vizir-Russian National team, won the $44,737 Liberty Classic for
women, the world's richest one-day race for women. She beat Diana
Ziluite of Lithuania by three bike lengths, or 18 feet. The first
51 finishers were timed in 2 hours 22 minutes 18 seconds for 57.6
miles, an average of 24.29 miles an hour. The race, run during the
men's race, drew 115 starters and 96 finishers. ... Jeannie Longo
of France and Zulfia Zabirova of Russia, the 1996 Olympic
champions, were involved in a four-rider crash 300 meters from the
finish. Both suffered scrapes and bruises, and Zabirova was
hospitalized as a precaution.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Albert Wynn of Maryland would seem an unlikely
figure to buck his party on the overhaul of campaign finance laws.
After all, he is seeking a position in the House Democratic
leadership next year.
</P>
<P>
   But like some others in the Congressional Black Caucus, Wynn has
doubts about banning the unlimited, unregulated contributions to
political parties, known as soft money, at the heart of abuses in
the 1996 campaign. His doubts are partly because some of those
contributions have traditionally paid for get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a legitimate source of money for party-building
activities such as voter registration, which are particularly
important in minority communities,'' said Wynn, who represents a
majority black district in the Washington suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The three-term congressman is balancing his doubts against party
loyalty. ``I consider myself a team player,'' he said, ``and I've
voted for things when I wasn't enamored with the idea in the
interest of the team and may do the same thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   As the House returns to its campaign finance debate, perhaps
later this week, the unlikely bipartisan coalition that has kept
the overhaul debate alive cannot afford to lose many of the three
dozen or so Democrats who, like Wynn, are undecided. Only 30 to 45
Republicans are thought to support the moves to reduce money in
politics. And that means that every Democratic vote is crucial if
an overhaul measure is to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, holding onto the Democrats is just one of the
challenges facing the coalition as it maneuvers through what could
turn into a summer of legislative traps and pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 100 ways to kill our bill and very few ways to pass
it,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who, with Rep. Martin
Meehan, D-Mass., is sponsoring the legislation that has drawn the
most support from groups seeking to reduce the influence of money
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 presidential election saw the virtual collapse of the
post-Watergate campaign finance system, as the two political
parties found ways to use unregulated contributions to get around
campaign spending limits. But Republican leaders in Congress oppose
the effort to tighten the law, seeing it as an effort to erode
their party's traditional fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to dispense with the campaign
finance issue in March under rules that never allowed the
Shays-Meehan bill to the floor. But the tactic backfired and gave
the issue momentum. So Gingrich, in an about-face, promised a full
and free-wheeling debate.
</P>
<P>
   It may be more like a three-ring circus. In a House that is
usually tightly controlled, the Republicans are allowing a dozen
separate overhaul proposals to be considered, along with 257
separate amendments. (That number has been whittled down from
nearly 600 proposed amendments.) The proposal that emerges with the
most votes will then be taken up for final consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich originally promised the issue would be debated by the
end of May. And debate did begin _ for several meandering hours and
without votes _ just before the Memorial Day recess. Debate was
scheduled to resume last week, but did not after the House spent
two days considering the budget. Republican leaders now say the
issue might come up this week, but Democrats suspect they are
stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promises, promises, promises, yet never a reality,'' Rep.
Carolyn Maloney of New York said late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a new form of filibuster?'' she asked the House
majority leader, Dick Armey, R-Texas. He promised enigmatically to
``make all the time that I can find available for the purpose of
carrying on this important debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have carefully tailored amendments to create maximum
political embarrassment to the Democrats and to split the
bipartisan coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, for example, is taking
a slap at Vice President Al Gore by sponsoring an amendment that
says federal law is the ``controlling legal authority'' prohibiting
fund raising on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The language in the amendment is a pointed reminder of a clumsy
political comment by Gore, who admitted he had made fund-raising
telephone calls from the vice president's office but defended his
actions by stating that ``there is no controlling legal authority''
or court ruling _ on the meaning of a statute that makes it
unlawful to ``solicit or receive any contribution'' in a federal
office.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who has formed a ``Free Speech Coalition'' to fight
campaign finance limits as unconstitutional, also has an amendment
calling on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent
counsel to examine President Clinton's 1996 fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., has introduced an amendment
reminding voters of the Clinton campaign's excesses. It would
prohibit campaign contributions made in exchange for access to the
White House, Air Force One and Two, the vice president's residence
and Marine One and Two, the helicopters that carry the president
and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last week, some supporters of overhauling campaign finance laws
began to fear that one measure that might get the most votes would
create a commission to study the issue and draw up a campaign
finance proposal. Because half of the commission's 12 members would
be appointed by Gingrich and by Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, who is also a supporter of the status quo, it was unclear
what the commission would come up with.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the commission from winning, its own Democratic
sponsors _ Maloney and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan _ announced
they would simply vote ``present'' on their own bill and would urge
other Democrats to follow their lead. That infuriated their
Republican co-sponsor, Rep. Rick White of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two other leading bipartisan overhaul proposals are the
Shays-Meehan legislation and a proposal crafted by a group of House
freshmen. A difference between the bills is how they deal with
unregulated money.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would effectively ban unregulated
contributions in federal elections by prohibiting such donations to
the national parties and by prohibiting state parties from using
unregulated money for any activity that could benefit a federal
candidate, including registration and get-out-the vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   The bill drafted by the freshmen would ban the national
political parties and federal candidates from raising money through
unregulated contributions. State political parties could raise and
use such contributions but not transfer them between states.
</P>
<P>
   A number of advocates of overhaul say they will vote for the
Shays-Meehan legislation and then fall back to the freshman bill if
their first choice does not gain a 218-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   Shays says that he has more than 200 votes and that he and
Meehan are trying to woo as many as 60 undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who is the House minority leader, is
also trying to unite Democrats around Shays's legislation. His vote
counters say the Democratic holdouts are, for the most part, either
minority lawmakers concerned about get-out-the-vote drives or
anti-abortion Democrats who have been swayed by the National Right
to Life Committee, which fiercely opposes spending and advertising
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Republians face a different choice: whether to split with their
party and join forces with the small group of Republicans who want
to change Washington politics. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who favors
overhaul, predicted that more of his colleagues than expected might
do so rather than cast an election-year vote to stop change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will get a lot of Republicans afraid to vote no,'' Wamp
said.

PIAZZA BRISTLES AT MARTINEZ'S BRUSHBACK WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forget about giving Mike Piazza a bat and Pedro
Martinez a baseball to settle their continuing dispute about
Martinez's inside fastball that plunked Piazza in the left hand on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just rent out Madison Square Garden, hand each player a
microphone and let Vince McMahon be the promoter. This verbal
skirmish about whether Martinez intended to hit Piazza has all the
earmarks of professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce animosity between Piazza and Martinez escalated
Sunday after Piazza, the Mets' catcher, chastised Martinez, the Red
Sox pitcher, for lacking decorum in uttering two expletives in
reference to him in an interview for Sunday's Boston Herald. A
perturbed Martinez countered by insisting that he has more class
than Piazza, who comes from a wealthy background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's pretty funny that all the money in the world
can't buy you class,'' said Piazza, swiping at Martinez's $75
million contract. ``I don't think there's any excuse for that
language in the paper. He should invest in lessons in etiquette.
It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez fired back with words as biting as one of his chin-high
fastballs and made reference to Piazza's perennially hefty bank
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``What class is he talking about?'' Martinez asked. ``He wants
to talk about class? Well, he was a millionaire since he was a kid.
But I can tell you the fans can't say anything bad about me. What
class? Education? School? What? He's not a better person than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has been out of the lineup since suffering the
bruised hand and was not scheduled to start Sunday night, accused
Martinez of trying to obscure the fact that he cursed in an
interview to be published in a paper that children might read.
Martinez agreed that expletives are not proper language for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous for him to make this into a background
thing,'' said Piazza, whose father, Vince, is a millionaire
entrepreneur, and who turned down a contract from the Dodgers in
excess of $80 million. ``I'm not better than him. I just think he
should have more manners on language in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that Piazza and Martinez were teammates
with the Dodgers for part of 1992 and all of 1993. After Martinez
hit Piazza with a 2-2 pitch and first base open in the first inning
on Friday, Piazza intimated strongly that he had been a target.
</P>
<P>
   The innuendo bothered Martinez, who is notorious for throwing
inside at hitters and does not dispute the reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald did not actually print the language that Martinez
used. But the paper made it clear he used expletives and quoted
Martinez as saying: ``You can put that in the paper. I could care
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that prompted an angry response from Piazza. Standing
in the cramped clubhouse at Fenway Park before Sunday night's game
against the Red Sox, Piazza speculated that Martinez's sensitivity
about the subject might be evidence that he had thrown at him on
purpose. Keeping with the World Wrestling Federation theme, Piazza
even challenged Martinez to journey the 200 yards across Fenway to
locate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's got a problem with me, he knows where to find me,''
said Piazza. ``It's unfortunate. I prefer to work these matters out
in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lawyer seizing an opening in the courtroom, Martinez
pounced on Piazza's challenging remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does he want me to do? Go and fight him? Go throw
punches?'' Martinez asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not me. That's where I have my class.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the mutual hostility, Piazza and Martinez both said they
did not have previous problems with each other. Both said they had
few encounters off the field when they were teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say about Piazza,'' Martinez said. ``I love
his dad. His dad is my friend. If he wants to talk about me hitting
him, that's why I said what I said. I don't need to have Michael
thinking I hit him on purpose. Come on. Give me a break. Michael
knows me better than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez conceded he has thrown at hitters, but only after one
of his teammates, as Piazza used to be, was already hit.
Essentially, that is what Piazza was hinting at on Friday, even
though no Red Sox were hit and it was the first game of the season
between the New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody hits one of my players, I'm not afraid to hit
anybody,'' Martinez said. ``I'm one of the best in the last three
years at hitting people. What is he talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was surprised that Martinez used profanities and
surprised that Martinez sounded so defensive Sunday. The catcher
then tweaked Martinez a final time before the two players and the
two teams part for the rest of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Piazza said, ``he didn't get the fruit basket I
sent him for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   The Mets think that Hideo Nomo might have been tipping off his
forkball this season and also think he should slow down his
corkscrew delivery because he was working too quickly. But Dave
Wallace, a senior adviser to the club who used to be Nomo's
pitching coach with the Dodgers, said he did not have concerns
about Nomo's debut on Tuesday against Tampa Bay at Shea Stadium.
``It wasn't like anything was way out of whack,'' Wallace said. ...
Mike Piazza said Manager Bobby Valentine told him to rest his
bruised left hand for one more day. ``It's still sore,'' Piazza
said. ``There's no need to push it.''

CLERGY URGE CLINTON TO PRESS CHINA ON PERSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Tibetan Buddhists to Roman Catholics to evangelical
Christians, a broad array of religious leaders is urging President
Clinton to use his summit meeting later this month in Beijing to
press the Chinese government to end the repression of religious
believers there.
</P>
<P>
   Religious persecution abroad has increasingly become a major
cause of concern among members of the U.S. clergy, many of whom say
that China is one of the most consistent violators of religious
freedom. Now rights advocates long concerned about the Chinese
occupation of Tibet have joined forces with Christian clergy
pushing for more freedom for Chinese churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 U.S. religious leaders have signed a letter to the
president asking him to put pressure on the Chinese government to
release all religious prisoners, to rescind decrees forcing
Christian churches to register with the government, and to open
negotiations about the future of Tibet with the Dalai Lama, the
Tibetan Buddhists' exiled leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summit,'' the religious leaders say in their letter,
``will certainly have great benefits for future economic and trade
relations between the United States and China. As important as
these issues are, however, human rights, and religious liberty in
particular, must not be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, drafted by the Center for Jewish and Christian
Values in Washington, is signed by people whose names rarely appear
on the same page. They include two Roman Catholic cardinals and
more than a dozen bishops, a spokesman for the Church of
Scientology, Reform and Orthodox rabbis, evangelical Christian
ministers and broadcasters, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and a wide
range of other religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for us, as Americans, to imagine what it must be
like to live in a country that denies its citizens basic human
rights,'' said Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, archbishop of
Philadelphia, who signed the letter along with Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York. ``For that reason, I join my brother bishops
and other concerned religious leaders in strongly urging President
Clinton to help open the door to religious liberties for the
Chinese people.''

 By TOM STEINERT-THRELKELD  Tom Steinert-Threlkeld is the editor in
chief of Inter(AT)ctive Week, an industry publication covering the
Internet and communications network technology. 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the last decade, Cisco Systems Inc. has been
steamrolling competitors in data networking. Its routers and
switches dominate the Internet and corporate networks that try to
get disparate sorts of computers to talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   It holds a 70 percent market share in routers and related
products, and the company's $79.3 billion value in the stock market
is more than four times the combined stock market value of its main
rivals: 3Com Corp., Bay Networks Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Cisco is on a collision course with a set of new,
much bigger competitors. Companies that have made their livelihoods
selling gear to the telephone industries are intent on moving into
Cisco's market.
</P>
<P>
   These companies contend that their long experience in running
dedicated-circuit voice networks gives them an edge over Cisco,
which has specialized in sending data as packets distributed over a
variety of pathways between routers, the traffic controllers of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of these new rivals are Lucent Technologies,
the spinoff of AT&AMP;T Corp. that includes Bell Labs, and Northern
Telecom of Canada, Lucent's chief competitor in the supply of
conventional switches and other equipment for telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they have the heft _ Lucent has three times the
annual revenue of Cisco _ but they also have the motivation. They
realize that the market for the equipment they have been selling,
which relies on setting up dedicated paths, or circuits, for each
communication, is quickly becoming doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, this dedicated-circuit approach, known as circuit
switching, seems destined to be replaced by more efficient and
economical packet-switching technology on which the Internet (and
Cisco's business) is based.
</P>
<P>
   Packet switching, originally intended for transmitting data, was
once thought to be too crude for voice communications. But
increased communications capacity and improvements in the way the
technology can organize the packets are beginning to make it
possible to use packet switching even for ``continuous flow''
information like voice conversations and even video programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a technology flash point where there is no longer a
question that data is the dominant architecture and voice is a
service,'' said Cisco's executive vice president, Don Listwin.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome Cisco's leadership in data networking, Lucent and
Northern Telecom will be counting on their ability to transfer the
characteristics of voice network technology to data networks.
</P>
<P>
   They will tout the ``extra level of engineering'' that goes into
the more complicated networks that carry voice traffic, as David
Ramos, Nortel's vice president for marketing, likes to put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one silver bullet,'' said Bill O'Shea, president of
Lucent's data networking business. ``It's years and years of
experience, building systems and watching how they operate'' that
insure reliability and avoid failures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lucent and Nortel are still very much newcomers. Only this
month will Lucent begin testing its first billion-bits-a-second
packet switch based on Internet protocols, which could become a
true competitor to Cisco's most advanced gear.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Telecom, for its part, derived only $785 million of its
$15.4 billion in revenue last year from data networking; it has a
long way to go to be on an equal footing with Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in this transition from the old world architecture of
circuit switching to the new world of packet switching, it is not
altogether certain that Cisco plans to slug it out with Nortel and
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's chairman, John Chambers reportedly broke off intensive
talks with Lucent about some sort of partnership because the two
companies' product lines had begun to overlap too closely. Now, he
is said to be bent on concluding an alliance with Nortel, which
could take advantage of its strengths in sales and service in the
telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the impulse to form new data networking alliances is not
Cisco's alone. Last week, the data-switch maker Tellabs announced
plans to acquire Ciena Corp., a high-flying supplier of a new
technology that vastly expands the capacity of fiber backbones, for
$7.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And a day later, another digital switch maker, DSC
Communications, agreed to be acquired for $4.4 billion in stock by
Alcatel Alsthom of France _ a telecommunications equipment giant
that wants to expand its American presence.
</P>
<P>
   So Cisco may find it increasingly difficult to steamroll the
competition. Last week, when Sprint announced plans for its
national network to evolve from circuit switching to packet
switching, attention centered on the fact that the key new pieces
of equipment for chopping voice, video and other data into
fixed-size packets would come from Cisco, and not from a
telecommunications vendor like Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco's gear, when ready, will only be found on the edge of
this new- era network. At its core will be data switches from the
Japanese giant NEC _ and, oh yes, from Nortel. &QL;

FACTORY OWNER WHO SUED LIZ CLAIBORNE DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The owner of a Brooklyn sweater factory who had
accused Liz Claiborne and the United States' leading
garment-industry union of conspiring to destroy his business has
died of a heart attack at his home in Monsey, according to his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Shraga Newhouse, 50 years old and the father of 10 children, was
the president and majority stockholder of Mademoiselle Knitwear.
The company filed a $90 million lawsuit last month against Liz
Claiborne and the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees, known as Unite.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contended that Claiborne had fraudulently schemed to
avoid a commitment to provide work to the Brooklyn company, which
filed for bankruptcy when Claiborne's orders stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also contended that the union had participated in
that scheme by abandoning an arbitration claim it had filed against
Claiborne on behalf of Mademoiselle's workers; in exchange,
Mademoiselle said, the union got a new collective bargaining
agreement that required Claiborne to pay the union a minimum of $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   The union and Claiborne insist that the payment was legitimate.

N.J. REJECTS REPORT TYING ABORTION TO WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of Rutgers University researchers hired by the New Jersey
government to examine the effects of the state's new welfare policy
found that it has contributed to an increase in abortions, but the
state has rejected the findings, and asked for revisions of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In a December report, commissioned by the state Department of
Human Services and the federal Department of Health and Human
Services and obtained by The New York Times, the Rutgers
researchers said the welfare overhaul provision known as the family
cap, which was enacted in 1992 and cuts off extra benefits from
welfare recipients who have additional children, has caused some
women to abort their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Family Development Program does appear to exert a small
but non-trivial effect on abortion rates, adding about 240
abortions per year over what would be expected due to trend and
population composition changes,'' the report said. There were
31,860 abortions in New Jersey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers findings are likely to add new fuel to the
nationwide debate over welfare because 20 other states have imposed
family caps similar to New Jersey's.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare recipients generally have abortions at a higher rate
than other women: In New Jersey, in the quarter ending December
1991, the abortion rate for the welfare population was 27 per 1,000
compared with 4 per 1,000 for all New Jersey women of child-bearing
age. And although the abortion rate in New Jersey, and nationwide,
declined between 1991 and 1996, the abortion rate among New
Jersey's welfare recipients rose during the same period. By 1996,
the Rutgers report found, the gap had widened further, with 29
abortions per 1,000 women receiving welfare, compared with 3 per
1,000 women in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has not accepted those findings, calling the
report a draft that needs substantial revision.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 14 letter to the research team, the Department of Human
Services said the document should be labeled a draft, criticized
the methodology and asked for a reworking that would explain all
the difficulties of determining whether it was the welfare policy
that had caused the increase in abortions. The letter also
questioned the validity of studying the behavior of the welfare
population before and after the law changed, since the changes
themselves may have altered that population, causing some
recipients to get off welfare, and other people to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers challenging the family cap provision contend
that the state's response reflects political problems, not
methodological ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a final report that the state is trying to
cover up by saying it's a draft,'' said Martha Davis, a lawyer with
the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, one of the groups
challenging the family cap. ``And we think the real reason for
their objections is concern about what legislators will do if they
see the conclusions the Rutgers researchers have drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Human Services, denied that interpretation. Rather, she said, the
state is committed to understanding what effects the family cap has
had, and is concerned about the release of draft findings based on
a methodology that the state says is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a draft,'' she said. ``Neither of the two
clients, us or Health and Human Services in Washington, has
approved it, and it's not final until it's approved. We want to
make sure that what we get is good social science research that is
clear about the effects of the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how welfare recipients' reproductive decisions
are affected by a family cap, removing any financial incentive to
have more children, has been one of the most hotly argued issues in
the debate over welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives have argued that family caps help discourage
welfare recipients from having more babies than they can support,
and prevent long-term welfare dependency. But in an unusual
political alliance, the Catholic Church and conservative Christian
groups joined with advocates for the poor to argue against family
caps, on the ground that they would encourage abortion and increase
child poverty by forcing welfare families to stretch their meager
benefits too far.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's family cap went into effect in 1993, under a
federal waiver allowing the state to conduct welfare experiments.
Two years later, the federal welfare overhaul bill opened the way
for any state to adopt such a policy, and currently family caps are
in effect in 20 other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rutgers findings have very serious implications for
children in every state that has instituted a family cap,'' said
Regina Purcell, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Conference of New
Jersey. ``It's important to remember not only the number of babies
that were aborted due to the family cap, but also the number of
children born who were denied assistance. As of December, more than
25,000 children in New Jersey had been denied cash assistance
because of the family cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Davis' group, along with the American Civil
Liberties Union of New Jersey and Gibbons Del Deo, a New Jersey law
firm, filed suit charging that the family cap violated the state
constitution by interfering with women's reproductive rights and
treated children differently depending on their birth status.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, in the course of preparing a summary judgment
motion in the case, Ms. Davis said, the lawyers asked the state
whether the final report from Rutgers, which had been long
scheduled for release in December, was available.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer in the attorney general's office gave them a copy of
the December report, which they shared with representatives of the
Catholic Church and others who oppose the family cap at a May 12
meeting. Ms. Davis said the lawyers challenging the cap had also
asked for, and been granted, permission to talk to the Rutgers
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, on May 14 _ the same day the department's letter
went out to the researchers _ the attorney general's office called
to say that the report was only a draft and to withdraw permission
to talk to the researchers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a report filed in December, and there was plenty of
time for back and forth about the methodology before May,'' Ms.
Davis said. ``The timing, together with the fact that this was in
no way labeled a draft, as an earlier interim report had been, lead
us to conclude that something else was going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tencza said there were no political machinations involved:
Discussions of the methodology had gone on since the report was
filed, she said, and the May 14 letter only reflected continuing
discussions. And she said that the lawyer for the attorney
general's office who gave out the report was simply unaware that it
was a draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an oversight, and it should not have been released,''
Ms. Tencza said. ``This is very complicated, very important social
science research, and there are many serious concerns about
methodology. We're not confident that there is any methodology that
would result in establishing a cause-and-effect relationship:
That's one thing we've learned through this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter specifically questioned the researchers' use of
trends in abortion and birth rates to estimate what those rates
might have been without the welfare changes, and the suggestion
that the welfare changes may have caused the difference. And it
said that the researchers need not redo the study, but should
submit a revised version in three weeks, making clear the
difficulties of determining causality.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Camasso, the lead researcher on the $1 million
evaluation project, declined to discuss the specifics of the
December report or the re-working now under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three different studies of the family cap, this
pre/post research, a cost-benefit analysis, and another using an
experimental group and a control group,'' he said. ``All I can say
is that the final reports on all three, which are not that far off,
will present the most comprehensive view possible of the effects of
the family cap.''
</P>
<P>
   The December report is not the first part of the family-cap
research to have its release delayed. In an interim report,
completed in 1996, the same Rutgers team found that while birth
rates among New Jersey welfare recipients had declined by more than
20 percent since the family cap law went into effect, the decline
was the same among those who forfeited extra benefits as among a
control group of women who were allowed to keep extra benefits for
their newborns. That report was released more than a year later,
only when the lawyers challenging the policy obtained it from the
federal government under a Freedom of Information Act request.

DISABLED MOTHERS WILL HAVE TO WORK UNDER MAYOR'S WELFARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an ambitious and controversial effort to increase
the number of welfare recipients participating in New York City's
workfare program, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will soon begin requiring
physically and mentally disabled mothers to work for their welfare
checks.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy began quietly this weekend when city officials
ordered about 800 disabled women to report to welfare offices for
screening into the new 20-hour-a-week workfare program.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who showed up at city offices clutching plastic pill
bottles and crumpled medical forms on Saturday, had already been
examined by city doctors who classified them as permanently or
temporarily unemployable since they suffer from chronic seizures,
mental illness, severe arthritis and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new rules, the mothers will be required to work in
jobs tailored to their specific impairments by nonprofit groups
accustomed to working with the disabled, including Goodwill
Industries of Greater New York. Women who cannot walk, for
instance, might type or stuff envelopes. Only those women with
disabilities severe enough to qualify for federal disability
benefits will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the old system, which allowed the disabled to
stay home until city doctors certified that they could work, denied
job training, work experience and career counseling to people who
desperately needed those services.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who will help finance and oversee the new
program, say about 12,000 disabled mothers will participate in
workfare initially, with the first group starting in two months.
The remaining 21,000 disabled welfare mothers may follow if the
program works well, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift in policy, which comes five months after Giuliani
vowed to move virtually all of the city's welfare recipients into
workfare jobs, was quickly condemned by advocates for the poor, who
said it violates state law and endangers the lives of the sickest
and most vulnerable New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between advocates and city officials over the issue
marks only the beginning of a contentious debate that will likely
land in civil court, and one that already swirls across much of the
nation as states like Florida, Oregon and Wisconsin push disabled
people on public assistance into the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethic has changed and a lot of states are trying to reach
into that population,'' said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare
policy for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, mothers on public assistance can receive
welfare checks for only five years, regardless of whether they are
disabled or not. State officials may exempt 20 percent of their
welfare mothers from the time limit, but many are still pushing as
many women into work as they can, fearful that more than 20 percent
will still need benefits when the deadline hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking and we want to help more participants
work,'' Tweedie said of the disabled on public assistance. ``The
hard part is figuring out how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where welfare officials have been sued for
assigning people with less serious medical ailments to workfare
jobs that threaten their health, advocates for the poor found the
new policy particularly alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a state judge ordered the city to create a process
that would allow welfare recipients to challenge work assignments
for health and safety reasons. But that process would apply to
welfare recipients without severe medical problems, workers with
asthma who can answer telephones but cannot scrub dusty garages,
for instance. This group is classified as employable, but with
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new policy is directed toward a group that city
doctors say are actually unable to work, and advocates say it will
be impossible to find suitable work for this group. About 4,000
welfare mothers have been deemed permanently unemployable by the
city's medical contractor, Health Services Systems. About 30,000
have been classified as temporarily unemployable, meaning they
cannot work for three to six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They are young women like Daisy Rivera, 28, who was deemed
permanently unemployable because she suffers from severe asthma and
weighs 400 pounds. They are older women like Evelyn Valle, 39, who
hobbled to the welfare office, leaning hard on a scratched wooden
cane because of the arthritis in her hip. Or like Aglaee Muniz, 57,
who takes medication for severe depression and diabetes and was
also classified as permanently unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say state law clearly exempts such people
from participating in work activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mind-boggling,'' said Susan Sternberg, a staff
attorney at the Brooklyn Neighborhood Office of the Legal Aid
Society, who represents the workfare workers with medical
limitations in their suit against the city. ``These are people who
the city has already found to be unable to participate in work
activities. This means hundreds more people are going to be sicker
and risk death.''
</P>
<P>
   But state and city officials say the policy is perfectly legal
because the law also requires disabled people who have ``the
potential to be restored to self-sufficiency'' to participate in
vocational rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the new program has been carefully planned to
meet the needs of this population, which was unable to participate
in the traditional workfare program along with the 32,000 current
participants. The work sites will be chosen by officials at four
groups, Goodwill Industries, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community
Service, the National Center for Disability Services and the
Federation Employment and Guidance Service, who will safeguard the
health and safety of the new workers.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the groups must place at least 228 mothers in
unsubsidized jobs for at least 90 days by March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be concerned about the disability, but that doesn't
mean these people are not worthy of being given an opportunity to
be productive members of the community, to use the talents they
have,'' said Debra Sproles, the spokeswoman for the Human Resources
Administration, which runs the city's welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole group that was forgotten about,'' Ms. Sproles
said. ``We want to proceed cautiously, but this is a great step
toward bringing these people back into the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, caseworkers for the four groups used a two-page
questionnaire to screen hundreds of mothers, who were either
temporarily disabled or permanently disabled women who had been
denied federal disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Those with serious disabilities were given an appointment for a
more complete evaluation, which will be reviewed by the State
Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals With
Disabilities. Most of those women will ultimately work 20 hours a
week for three months, and 35 hours a week after that, while
receiving career counseling, job search training and other
services. Twenty other New York counties, including Westchester and
Onondaga, also received state financing for similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those welfare recipients who are determined to lack serious
disabilities will be re-examined by city doctors and may eventually
end up in the traditional workfare program, although they can
appeal that decision, city officials said. And those with the most
severe medical problems will be told to apply for federal
disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how smoothly the new process will work. Advocates
for the poor in Wisconsin, which has also eliminated broad work
exemptions for the disabled, said they have not encountered
widespread problems. Jason Turner, the recently appointed chief of
New York City's welfare agency, was the architect of that state's
welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   But the sheer size of New York City's welfare population makes
the job infinitely more complex. Wisconsin has only about 9,000
adults on public assistance statewide, while New York City has
about 200,000 mothers on welfare, including the 33,000 disabled
women.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of those women filled the waiting rooms of the city's
welfare offices on Saturday, sitting on hard, plastic chairs as
they thumbed through plastic bags and time-worn envelopes for their
medical records. Most seemed stunned to learn that they were going
to work after city doctors had told them that they could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work with people who can't see, who can't hear,'' a
caseworker from one of the nonprofit groups told a doubtful woman,
who said a stroke left her with chronic seizures. ``I work with
people who have only one leg, in wheelchairs. We're here to help
you find jobs.''

BULLS PLAY MIND GAMES AGAINST MALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Bulls are still trying to fool with Karl
Malone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Scottie Pippen whispered to Malone before Malone
went to the free-throw line in Game 1 of the NBA finals, ``The
Mailman doesn't deliver on Sundays.'' Malone missed the two free
throws, setting up Michael Jordan's game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, after Game 2 of this year's finals, Dennis Rodman
said shutting down Malone was no problem, ``if the referees let me
play my game.'' He went on to say of Malone: ``He's effective when
he can get around guys who are stagnant, like Luc Longley. He can't
do that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when asked if Rodman's defense was the reason he had
made just 14-of-41 shots in Games 1 and 2, Malone just rolled his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman might get the same response from NBC executives after his
remarks when he exited the Delta Center in Salt Lake City on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to come back here for Game 6,'' Rodman said.
``Because NBC wants its money. They need the money. Without the
Chicago Bulls, they're nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen did not agree. As he was leaving the Delta Center on
Friday night, he boasted to the national cable television channel
CNN-SI: ``We're not coming back. Get ready for the WNBA season.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's remarks after Chicago's 93-88 victory in Game 2 alluded
to Utah's entry in the Women's National Basketball Association, the
Starzz, who begin their season on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams in Demand
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams is watching the labor situation between the
owners and the players more closely than most veteran power
forwards are. An invaluable rebounder for the New Jersey Nets, who
nearly partied himself out of the National Basketball Association
four years ago, Williams is one of the hottest commodities on the
free agent market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving the Nets the first crack, and hopefully we can get
it done, but after that everything's fair game,'' he said before
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is working for a variety of news outlets, doing his own
offbeat commentary on the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA.com, NBA Jam, anything you can think of,'' he said.
``Funny, huh? They didn't want me around a few years ago. Now I'm
working for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches Aren't Complaining
</P>
<P>
   One of the subplots swirling about the Bulls' seven-game series
with the Indiana Pacers was the tug-of-war Phil Jackson and Larry
Bird were playing with the officials' ears. One day it was Bird
contending that Scottie Pippen was getting away with hammering Mark
Jackson on defense. The next day it was Jackson railing on the
referees for their lack of ``courage'' in making calls on the
Pacers in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And now ... not a peep. Although there have been some
questionable calls, neither Jackson nor Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan has
made the officiating of this series an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fight them as hard as I can on the sideline,''
Sloan said before Game 3 Sunday night. ``But when the game is over,
it's over. It makes no sense to hear all that stuff once it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal Has a Doubter
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal is homing in on the vacant Seattle SuperSonics
coaching job, but he has apparently run into a huge hurdle: Gary
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, the Sonics' All-Star guard, is unconvinced that
Westphal, a former Phoenix Suns coach, is the right man for the
job, according to a person close to Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle General Manager Wally Walker and Payton are expected to
meet on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of Westphal replacing
George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Silas, a Charlotte assistant who was a part of the Sonics'
lone championship team in 1979, interviewed for the position. Lenny
Wilkens was also said to be in the mix, but Atlanta Hawks General
Manager Pete Babcock said the Sonics have yet to ask permission to
speak with Wilkens, who coached the Sonics from 1977 to 1985.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   It's been 38 years since I moved from Greenwich Village to
Washington, but I still return regularly to Manhattan for, among
other pleasures, an eavesdropping fix. Here's what I overheard on
the fourth floor of Barney's recently:
</P>
<P>
   One salesperson to another: ``Every morning when I wake up I
thank God that I know how to accessorize.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Five minutes before the start of a recent Broadway performance,
a theatergoer suddenly realized that his tiny cell phone had
somehow slipped out of his pocket and was lost somewhere beneath
the seats in his row.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors were frantically helping him search the dimly
lighted theater when, several rows back, a smartly dressed Wall
Street type waved his own cell phone in the air and shouted:
``Quick, what's your number? I'll call you from mine.'' Within 30
seconds, a steady and distinct ring led the owner to the precise
spot where his phone had fallen, just as the curtain was rising on
the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Libby Jane Thall still gets a laugh when she thinks about the
conversation she overheard on Marathon Sunday on the Upper East
Side. She stopped and asked a woman in a silver aluminum apres-race
cape how she had done. The woman replied that her time had been
great and, as Ms. Thall was congratulating her, a father with a
daughter about 5 years old walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, why is that lady dressed as a baked potato?'' the girl
asked.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   On a recent flight from Columbus, Ohio, to La Guardia Airport,
my wife and I were seated behind a woman with a girl of about 4 or
5. It was obviously the girl's first flight because the woman was
narrating every detail, about the plane, the clouds, etc.
</P>
<P>
   We approached New York from the south and were treated to a
spectacular view of the skyline, beginning with the Statue of
Liberty and proceeding along Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there's New York City,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So where's the big apple?'' the little girl replied.
</P>

   The classic children's song ``The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and
Round'' is keeping up with the times in some milieus. True, the
wheels are still going round and round, the wipers are swishing and
the doors are opening and closing. But forget those coins going
clink, clink, clink.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Kandel was at the Children's Museum with her two sons
recently when the sing-along leader led mothers and children in
updating the verse. Pretending to slide their cards, they sang,
``The Metrocard on the bus goes `transfer OK, transfer OK, transfer
OK,' all over town.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the red light to change on Madison Avenue in the
50s, I looked down and saw a poignant message scratched in a small
repaved area off the curb. In block letters the message said:
``MILLY PLEASE COME HOME I LOVE YOU.''
</P>
<P>
   That opened a stream of questions. I assume that Milly is a
female and the writer a male. Who is Milly: a wife, friend, sister,
child, dog? Why did Milly leave? Where did she go? Did she love
him? Has she returned? If she has returned, are they happy
together?
</P>
<P>
   Did he know that Milly often frequented that corner so that she
would one day read the pleading message?
</P>
<P>
   REVA FOX wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   A friend writes that the movers were still going in and out of
his new apartment when a woman walked through the open door into
the living room and announced that she lived in one of the
prestigious buildings on the block. Her daughter was returning from
London, she said, and she wanted her to live in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She had looked at the kitchen on her way in and the apartment
was perfect, she continued. As for the view, her daughter would
love it.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat stupefied new tenant informed her that the
apartment wasn't available _ he had taken it. She ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll look around and see if my daughter will be comfortable,''
she said blithely as she took off to look at the bedrooms. She
emerged from her inspection to query: ``Where are the other
bedrooms?'' She was told there was only the one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will never do,'' the woman proclaimed and stalked off.
</P>
<P>
   And if there had been two or three bedrooms, what then?
</P>
<P>
   Strolling along Second Avenue in the 60s, Charles Potter passed
a rather frazzled young woman wearing a T-shirt that advised: MAKE
LOVE NOT LAW REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A red light on the Bowery.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Martin Zelkind and a panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   Action: The panhandler approaches Zelkind who, trying to
forestall the inevitable request, says: ``Please don't annoy me; I
have a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantaneous response from the panhandler: ``Take two aspirins
and call me in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the panhandler accomplish his mission and get a handout? Of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Schiff was walking through Central Park when she
encountered a small dog, barking wildly, tugging at his leash and
jumping in the air. The object of his excitement was a much larger
dog, also on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the small dog shook her head and addressed the
other owner. ``He just has no common sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Ring reports that merger mania apparently isn't confined
to the financial industry. She spotted this handwritten sign in the
window of a recently closed Chinese restaurant on the Upper East
Side. ``China Inn had merger with Ming Garden,'' it said, and
listed the new location.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   My son, Graham, a high school senior, and I often commute
together. We had just squeezed onto a crowded D train when I
glanced down and saw that my shoelace was untied. There were no
seats, nor even a place to lean against. I knew that bending down
to tie it meant, at best, getting my long coat and briefcase dirty
and, at worst, losing my balance when the train inevitably lurched.
</P>
<P>
   I was mumbling that I'd wait until I got off when Graham dropped
to a crouch and tied it for me. My beaming at him stopped abruptly
when he pulled himself up to full height, looked down at me and
announced, very loudly, ``You know, you're going to have to learn
how to do this yourself.''

ON BASEBALL: CONFIDENCE BOOSTER FOR A COMPLETE PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excuse David Cone if, deep down, he never saw the humor in his
recent run-in with an impish Jack Russell terrier with a serious
overbite.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence, not comedy, is what counts, especially at this point
in the career of a veteran pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   When you're 35, with more great years behind you than ahead of
you, even a 7-1 record doesn't always bring peace. Losing a
starting assignment because of a freak injury certainly doesn't,
not when every tweak and tinge increasingly serves as a reminder of
one's mortality.
</P>
<P>
   So don't assume that the bite that took a chunk out of Cone's
index finger and out of the Yankees' rotation, and cost Cone a
start last Tuesday, was in any way humorous to him. Not when his
reality includes mandatory pitch counts and salary incentives tied
to innings totals that are no longer sure things.
</P>
<P>
   The setback put Cone in a fury. And the only way to assuage that
fury, as well as stem the torrent of bad jokes, was to pitch well.
Sunday the Florida Marlins were the unwitting victims of that
resolve, learning that the pedigree of the pitcher, not the dog,
was what truly counted. Cone roared back to the forefront of the
Yankees' impressive rotation, pitching a 14-strikeout complete game
and not only beating the Marlins, 4-1, but beating a pack of his
own demons.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, Cone's eighth straight, helped prove that he can
still stay the course, can still finish as routinely and strongly
as he started. This was not only important to the Yankees' manager,
Joe Torre, and their pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre. It was
important to Cone. ``It was more important to me than Joe or Mel,
more important for my confidence, to be able to finish that game,''
Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus his intense lobbying after the eighth inning, the only one
in which the Marlins managed a run. The overmatched youngsters from
the decimated World Series champions had broken through when Cone
issued a two-out walk to second baseman Craig Counsell, then a
run-scoring double to Florida's burgeoning gem, Todd Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   The double, which deeply disappointed Cone, also drove him. He
all but begged for the right to pitch the ninth inning. Torre, his
team about to go 31 games over .500, did not need that much
convincing. The Yankees had a three-run lead, Cone had shown the
necessary heart, as always, and Torre did not hesitate in showing
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK,''' Torre summed up. ``You've been around. You
know what he means to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone knows what he has done in the past. He needed to know what
he could provide in the future. He needed the ninth, he said, ``to
be able to get a little deeper and complete the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big hurdle to overcome,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such is the nature of even the most competent and proven. They,
too, need to be convinced. Especially when the career path is as
pocked as Cone's has been in recent years. His injuries seem as
plentiful as they are peculiar. Surgeries were performed on the
pitcher's shoulder to correct an aneurysm in 1996 and to clean out
the debris caused by wear and tear in '97.
</P>
<P>
   This year, rust first dogged the pitcher. Then came his mother's
terrier puppy, Veronica, causing more embarrassment than concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a situation I wish I could have avoided,'' Cone
said after pitching his gem. ``Maybe in the back of my mind it was
important to put that issue to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone sought to put more serious issues to bed as well Sunday.
For the relentless setbacks of the last few years have prevented
Cone from regaining his Cy Young-caliber touch. That had caused
more doubts than one little nip could. This Cone knows; his
teammates know it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so used to being so good, it's hard,'' said Darryl
Strawberry, who grew up with Cone on the Mets and now grows older
alongside him in the Bronx. ``I tell him it's just a matter of time
before you find your rhythm, that coming back from injuries is
tough. I tell him you're 8-1, you're just getting started, but it's
hard for him to keep patient.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit disconcerting to hear a pitcher talk about needing
the boost of confidence after watching him master a team, even one
so flailing as the Marlins, losers of 11 straight.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, the 53rd complete game of Cone's career and
his 49th game with 10 or more strikeouts. It was, in the end, Cone.
Florida Manager Jim Leyland called him ``one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically just overmatched some of our young guys,''
Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   And there he was, clinging to his first complete-game victory
since May 1996 as if it were a life preserver, needing a boost of
confidence only he could provide for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, that's what people don't understand _ that's what it is
all about,'' Strawberry said. ``That's the confidence we all need,
to know that we can do what we've always done. Our minds know that
we can, but our bodies need to be able to do it, too.''

CAPS WALTZ TO FINALS, BUT IS THE MUSIC OVER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Mixing his usual candor with a little diplomacy, coach
Ron Wilson of the Washington Capitals was evaluating how his team
came to find itself in the Stanley Cup finals against the defending
champion, Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to the teams that we played, but we had a draw
that you dream about before the season,'' Wilson said. ``We didn't
have to face Philadelphia, New Jersey or Pittsburgh, the three
teams that really have given the Caps trouble over the years,
psychologically. So we weren't carrying any baggage around. I think
that helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with their history of eliminating the Washington team, the
Flyers, Devils and Penguins were the top three seeded teams in the
Eastern Conference. Instead of playing any of them, the
fourth-seeded Capitals faced Boston, Ottawa and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, beginning here Tuesday night in Joe Louis Arena, the
Capitals meet the Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings,
who will be making their third appearance in four seasons in the
championship round. With the possible exception of the goalie
position, the Red Wings seem to match up stronger than the Capitals
in talent and depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have our hands full,'' Wilson said. ``Not too
many people are going to give us a chance. Everyone probably thinks
that we'll go out four straight.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-game sweep would continue a trend. Since the New York
Rangers needed seven games to eliminate the Vancouver Canucks in
the 1994 finals, the next three championships have been four-game
minimums: the Devils over the Wings in 1995, Colorado over Florida
in 1996 and the Wings over the Flyers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Should this season's final go seven games, the last would be on
June 23, after the official start of summer. Except for the
lockout-delayed season that ended on June 24, 1995, no Stanley Cup
final has ended later than June 14. Among the reasons for this long
season are the 16-day Olympic break in February, the four-day
All-Star Game break in January and the extra off days during the
playoffs to accommodate television. These and other factors have
resulted in dwindling ratings, poor ice and fan apathy in even some
of hockey's bedrock cities.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of interest here. Cars, buildings and statues
are decorated in the red and white of the home team. Not since the
1950s have Detroiters enjoyed as much hockey success as the Wings
have had under coach Scotty Bowman, who took over in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The team is experienced and balanced with skilled scorers and
diligent checkers. In eliminating the regular-season champion
Dallas Stars in six games in Round 3, the Red Wings survived a big,
mean team that tried to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals are not as nasty, although the churlish threesome
of Dale Hunter, Chris Simon and Craig Berube provides a hint of the
Crash Line element that proved disconcerting to the Wings when they
were swept by the Devils three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The big hitter of the Capitals defense is Mark Tinordi, who has
had a few days to recover from the leg injury that slowed him at
the end of the previous round. The eternal Esa Tikkanen, a forward
who seems to show up with different playoff contenders every year,
also might help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scores big goals in big games,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen is especially valuable as a shadow checker, as he was
in the second round against Ottawa's Aleksei Yashin. He might cover
Detroit's Sergei Fedorov, who leads the league in post-season goals
with nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals get much of their offense from two lines: the
Collegians and the Europeans. The collegians are Adam Oates, Joe
Juneau and Brian Bellows. Both Oates and Juneau attended Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, although Bellows is not a college man. The
Europeans are Peter Bondra, Andrei Nikolishin and Richard Zednik.
</P>
<P>
   Oates leads his team in playoff points with 14. A former Red
Wing, Oates is one of the league's most creative passers. The best
attacker of the defense is Sergei Gonchar, who has 7 goals in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In goal, Washington's Olaf Kolzig has the best goals-against
average: 1.69 a game. Detroit's goalie, Chris Osgood, is capable of
shutting out a team and also capable of squandering a lead or a tie
on a wishful shot from center ice. At this level, all goalies are
capable of shutouts, especially those who play for great teams. But
few give up two goals from center ice in the same spring. And
Osgood's clearing passes are frequently intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   If Detroit has a weak link, it is Osgood, but his supporting
cast is too strong to fail as a group. Nicklas Lidstrom leads the
attacking defensemen. Slava Fetisov, Larry Murphy, Bob Rouse and
Jamie Macoun fill out an aging but steady blue-line crew. Among the
best two-way wing men, Darren McCarty and Martin Lapointe hit first
and score second.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, Fedorov is the most skilled, although Steve
Yzerman leads the team in points with 20. Fedorov, Yzerman and Igor
Larionov are among the sport's most complete centers.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Wings win the Cup it would be Bowman's eighth, tying
him with his mentor, Toe Blake. Absent a monumental upset, it will
be rings for the Wings. &QL;

ON HORSE RACING: RUN THE HORSES AND HOLD THE MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ For the second year in a row, the business of
horse racing was saved by, of all things, a horse and a race. Not
by a marketing plan or an advertising campaign or a creative
department.
</P>
<P>
   The horse was Real Quiet, the race was the Belmont Stakes, the
plot was high drama: would Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness, also win the Belmont Stakes and become the 12th
horse in history to win the Triple Crown? Or would he become the
14th horse to lose on the lip of history?
</P>
<P>
   To watch the drama unfold, a crowd of 80,162 went to Belmont
Park on a brilliantly sunny afternoon. It was the second largest
crowd to watch a race at Belmont and the largest in 27 years, since
Canonero II tried (and failed) to complete his Triple Crown sweep
before 82,694. And the multitudes on Saturday saw a classic race:
Real Quiet opening a four-length lead in the homestretch but, with
his Triple Crown within reach, struggling to withstand his
weariness and his challenger, Victory Gallop, who streaked up
alongside him for one more duel.
</P>
<P>
   You could not have scripted it any better. In the Kentucky
Derby, it was Real Quiet by half a length over Victory Gallop. In
the Preakness, by 2\ lengths. And now, it was Victory Gallop
reversing recent history and winning the Belmont by one bob of the
head.
</P>
<P>
   This was the essence of racing at its best, the ultimate
definition of ``the product,'' something the public understands and
craves in all sports: a contest. Yet the people trying to ``save''
racing from its current decline and future financial ruin seem to
keep looking the other way. They recently searched for a leader and
found one in Tim Smith, a lawyer from Atlanta who knows little
about racing but who apparently knows a lot about the arts of
promotion, sponsorship and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was there Saturday with the 80,162 fans who saw the race
of their lives. They even bet large amounts of money: $9.3 million
at Belmont Park, the second largest amount ever recorded there, and
$55 million from all sources, far and near, the most since last
year's Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   To search committees, that's the bottom line. You can sense it
in the commercials being run by the advertising agency selected to
carry the message. They feature a bold young woman cruising the
sidelines and shrieking the official slogan, ``Go, baby, go,''
while the text says: ``There comes a time in every girl's life when
she puts away her innocence, steps up to the window and says,
`Gimme a $50 exacta box and make it snappy.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is far-fetched and, worse, it takes racing on the low road
to salvation. Maybe there is no high road to reach gamblers, but
maybe that's questionable, too. Why make your pitch to common
gamblers when you're trying to rescue a sport from extinction?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody sensed the true meaning of Belmont Day better than James
Bond, the trainer of Raffie's Majesty, who finished fifth while the
stars of the cast were staging their memorable duel.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see 80,000 people in that place,'' Bond said Sunday morning
at his barn, ``and to hear the roar of the crowd for a $2
admission, you'd have to say they got their money's worth. It's
just unbelievable how great this game is. It's not just the
gambling, it's fun.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, the trainer of Silver Charm last year and Real
Quiet this year, both dramatic Triple Crown losers, defines the
product correctly. For all the glory of his Triple Crown classics,
he still hasn't won in eight starts on New York tracks. But he
insists that's the nature of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, fractured his ankle
playing pick-up basketball last week and had to tend his horse on
crutches. He even enlisted a superstar trainer, Bill Mott, to
saddle Victory Gallop in the paddock for the Belmont, so give Mott
an assist. Walden doesn't miss the point, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's going to change,'' he said. ``I'll just keep taking
care of business and play with my kids. I'm blessed to have a horse
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   So is racing. But the racing fathers seem bent on ``saving''
their business with vague marketing plans, dubious advertising
pitches and ``national'' racing schedules that will be difficult to
maintain. The first thing they did was to raise $20 million,
chiefly for advertising aimed at bettors. And they probably will
achieve some cosmetic and statistical gains in television coverage,
less likely in ratings and attendance, more likely in handle.
</P>
<P>
   But they had better hurry. In the last six months, racing has
lost two of its best tracks: Arlington Park in Chicago and Atlantic
City. Can slot machines be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can't count on the enormous pull of the Belmont Stakes
to solve all your problems day by day. But how can you not start
with those 80,162 fans, the national television audience and those
two brave horses who carried the racing business into the minds and
wallets of America?

MERGER EXPECTED BETWEEN NORWEST AND WELLS FARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn.)  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the banking industry's latest megamerger, Norwest Corp. of
Minneapolis and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. of San Francisco plan to join
forces and may announce the $34 billion deal as early as Monday,
according to people close to both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transaction is structured as a so-called merger of
equals, Norwest's chief executive, Richard Kovacevich, will run the
combined company as chief executive while Wells' chief executive,
Paul Hazen, will relinquish that post.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank will be based in San Francisco and retain the Wells
Fargo name. With combined assets of $185 billion, it will rank as
the sixth-largest bank in the United States if all other bank
mergers announced this year are completed.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of the merger follows a now familiar pattern: Many
banks, stuck in an industry with little revenue growth and
heightened competition from brokerage firms, mutual funds and
credit-card companies, see size as a solution to their woes.
Bulking up, banks believe, will enable them to become more
profitable by dominating certain markets and enjoying greater
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a string of bank-related blockbusters this
year that have surprised Wall Street, including the mergers of
Citicorp and Travelers Group, BankAmerica Corp. and Nationsbank
Corp. and First Chicago NBD and Banc One Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevich, considered to be one of the most disciplined and
talented executives in banking, said in a recent interview that he
felt no need to merge with another bank and that he found the
recent prices being paid for banks to be exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kovacevich has said he would buy another bank
if the price was right, and in this case it apparently was. Norwest
will exchange about 10 shares for each Wells share, representing a
premium of only about 10 percent to Wells' closing stock price on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Big Wells investors, such as Warren Buffett, were apparently
willing to accept a slim takeover premium based on the combined
company's prospects. As of last December, Buffett owned 7.87
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wells would have been unthinkable as a takeover target a few
years ago, when it emerged as the victor in a hotly contested
battle for First Interstate Corp. of Los Angeles, but Wells botched
the integration of the two banks. That cost Wells precious profits
and customers, and brought Hazen, long considered a skilled
manager, some unaccustomed criticism from analysts and Wall Street.
And it left Wells vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Wells Fargo's shares rose 3 percent, or $10.75, to
$363.25, on optimism that profit growth will accelerate as the bank
builds revenue with little increase in expenses, along with
speculation that Wells Fargo might be in talks.

REAL QUIET UNDONE BY LAST QUARTER-MILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Real Quiet's future might include the $1 million
race at Del Mar this summer. It certainly won't include any 1{-mile
races.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Triple Crown hopefuls who fail in the Belmont Stakes,
Real Quiet was undone by the unusual length of the race here
Saturday, losing a four-length lead in the final furlong to be
nosed out by Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Belmont had been a mile and a quarter the last two
years,'' said trainer Bob Baffert, who also saw Silver Charm lose a
Triple Crown in the final yards in 1997, ``I would have won 'em
both.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Belmont were a mile and a quarter, a Triple Crown
wouldn't be such a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet and jockey Kent Desormeaux led the field into the
homestretch but hit the marathoners' wall and staggered through a
26.34-second final quarter. Of the 14 horses who lost Triple Crowns
in the Belmont, nine had a final split slower than 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 horses who completed Triple Crowns in the Belmont
since the race went to 1{ miles, eight went 26 seconds or faster.
</P>
<P>
   There's the irony of the Belmont: The defining moment of these
horses' careers, the difference between winning and losing a
$5-million Triple Crown bonus, is a race at a distance completely
out of line with the rest of the U.S. stakes schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, will scan
that schedule for their colts' next starts, with a rematch of the
Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont quinella horses a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Walden said he's looking at the $1 million Haskell Invitational
for 3-year-olds at Monmouth Park (N.J.) on Aug. 9, and Victory
Gallop could go on to the $750,000 Travers for 3-year-olds at
Saratoga in upstate New York on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who isn't much for long-range planning, said Real Quiet
could go to the Travers or face older horses for the first time in
the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 15. Three-year-old Best Pal
won the $1-million race in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer said Real Quiet could even go in the $500,000 Swaps
Stakes at Hollywood Park on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably run him in a couple of weeks, that's how
tough he is,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Real Quiet will go to the Travers and Baffert will
run 4-year-old Silver Charm in the Pacific Classic. Silver Charm is
at Churchill Downs training for the $750,000 Stephen Foster
Handicap on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited meeting of Silver Charm and Skip Away could
come in the Pacific Classic. First, Skip Away is aiming for the $1
million Hollywood Gold Cup against Gentlemen on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baffert said he hasn't chosen a next race for Indian
Charlie, the Santa Anita Derby winner who ran third in the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet flew out of New York Sunday morning and will be at
Churchill, Baffert said, probably until the season ends there June
28. Then he will go home to California.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said owner Mike Pegram has promised not to race Real
Quiet against Silver Charm unless the latter's owners, Bob and
Beverly Lewis, say it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he felt worst for Pegram after Real Quiet's
photo-finish defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I've had bigger disappointments than this, even when I
was training quarter horses,'' Baffert said. He said Cavonnier's
come-from-ahead loss to Grindstone in the 1996 Derby felt worse.
``The Derby, that's the race for me. This (the Belmont) was for
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown vanished Saturday just the way history said it
might. Real Quiet didn't lose by a nose, he lost by a quarter-mile.

DEMOCRATS SEE INSURANCE RATES AS WEAPON IN GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The high cost of auto insurance, an issue that
nearly cost Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey her job last year,
appears on the verge of becoming a major theme in New York's
gubernatorial campaign, with Democrats blaming Gov. George Pataki
for high rates.
</P>
<P>
   Now that New Jersey has mandated a 15 percent cut in rates, New
York is about to overtake its neighbor as the state with the
nation's highest auto insurance premiums, having risen from sixth
place since 1993. Some Democratic strategists say that New York's
dubious new ranking could help give the issue the same political
potency here that it proved to have last year in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   All four Democratic candidates for governor have recently begun
attacking Pataki, a Republican, over auto insurance prices, and the
two front-runners in the polls, Peter Vallone, the New York City
Council speaker, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, plan to release
within the next few days their own plans for lowering rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go after it tooth and nail,'' Vallone said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies make for easy political targets, as attacks
on health insurers across the country have shown. For the Democrats
in New York, taking on auto insurers has the added benefit of
playing into their claims that Pataki has been too cozy with big
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the Pataki administration's approach to
regulation is to give the regulated industry whatever it wants,''
said James Larocca, one of the Democratic candidates for governor
and a former state transportation and energy commissioner. ``This
has the potential to be a huge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Deister, a spokesman for Pataki, pointed to a very
slight decline in rates last year, the first drop in a decade, and
said the governor deserved the credit, in part, because the state
had been more aggressive about combating insurance fraud. ``The
governor took action while Democrats sat on their hands for
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a report released last week by the majority Democrats in the
state Assembly gave fresh ammunition to the challengers. It says
that during the 1990s, rates and insurance company profits have
risen much faster in New York than in the nation as a whole, and it
blames Pataki, whose administration has approved each rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The average auto insurance policy in New York cost $705 in 1990.
It rose under Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, to $870 in 1994, the
year Pataki was elected. And it continued to climb under the new
governor, to $960 in 1996, up 36 percent in six years. The average
rate dropped last year to $954, and appears headed for another
small decline this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has been asleep at the wheel while we've
been drifting up on these charts,'' said Assemblyman Alexander
Grannis, D-Manhattan, who was a co-chairman of the task force that
produced the report. ``Insurers have seen an opportunity in New
York because of the lax regulatory attitude of this
administration.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neil D. Levin, who was appointed state insurance superintendent
by Pataki, responded to the report by saying that the competitive
forces of the market should be allowed to determine rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats said that in the two weeks remaining in
this year's legislative session they would seek passage of several
laws that they said would cut rates by more than 21 percent, like
antifraud measures, the appointment of a consumer advocate to
contest proposed rate increases, and the creation of a toll-free
number to help customers comparison-shop among insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have considerable leverage because some auto
insurance laws that the governor and the industry favor are set to
expire this summer, and the Democrats could withhold renewal of
those laws unless their proposals are enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said the Assembly would not try to legislate a specific
rate reduction, as New Jersey lawmakers have, for fear of roiling
what is now a fairly stable, profitable market. Some insurers have
abandoned the New Jersey market, contending that it is too
difficult to make a profit there.

<P>
   In last year's New Jersey race, state Sen. James McGreevey, a
Democrat, found a vast untapped well of resentment over the state's
high rates. He exploited it so well against Whitman, a Republican
to whom Pataki is often compared, that despite being little-known
when the campaign began, he narrowly missed defeating her in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney and another
candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, said the
insurance issue ``could have the same power it did in New Jersey.''

KOREAN-AMERICANS WELCOME KIM DAE JUNG IN NEW JERSEY

   CLIFFSIDE PARK, N.J. _ The initial shock has worn off, a
schoolteacher named Joung Pyo Jyoung said Sunday, but she still
marvels at how Kim Dae Jung, the longtime dissident, came to be
elected president of South Korea, her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surprising thing,'' she said at the very moment that
Kim entered a Cliffside Park banquet hall where she and 500 other
Korean-Americans had gathered to honor him Sunday, his first full
day of a state visit that is to take him across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jyoung was hardly the only one here to express amazement at
a political odyssey that can be compared to the ultimate triumphs
of Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Vaclav Havel of the Czech
Republic and other champions of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   Successive South Korean dictators tried to have Kim killed,
coming extremely close more than once. In 1980, the military regime
then in charge sentenced him to the gallows, but chose instead to
send him into exile in the United States. Even after he returned
home in 1985, and after South Korea then nurtured a fledgling
democracy, he seemed destined to spend the rest of his years in
permanent opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was Sunday, his country's leader since February,
walking triumphantly into the banquet hall with a slight limp, the
legacy of one of those assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people now say that after all he went through, maybe he
was meant to be president,'' said Ms. Jyoung, who lives in New
York. ``When you go through so much, maybe you become a better
person.''
</P>
<P>
   His tortured road to political power was clearly on Kim's own
mind as he spoke to the crowd for 35 minutes. ``It's a funny
thing,'' he said to laughter as he began his remarks in Korean,
``but nobody believed that I'd be standing here as president.''
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic, he told of how after his election he had
called on Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou Hwan, South Korea's Roman
Catholic prelate. The cardinal, he said, had observed that his
election should stand as a model to young Koreans of how
perseverance can lead to success.
</P>
<P>
   That's true, Kim said he replied, but something else counted,
too. ``It is important to live long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 74, seemed to enjoy wading through the crowd and shaking
hands with the Korean-Americans, many of whom had left South Korea
20 or 30 years ago but still had deep emotional and economic ties
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   He was applauded warmly and often by the guests _ for the most
part business people, academics and clergy who came from New York
City or from this part of Bergen County where thousands of
Korean-Americans have settled. He was also ardently praised as a
fighter for democracy by Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an underlying restraint. It was a sharp contrast
to the emotional outbursts that Kim, a gifted speaker, is capable
of producing.
</P>
<P>
   Some who came to the Palisadium banquet hall, on the Hudson
River, said they would probably not have voted for him if they had
had the chance. They were not sure at first, they said, that he was
the right person to guide the country through its most serious
financial crisis in decades. Like millions of South Koreans, they
had long heard military-dominated governments denounce Kim as an
irresponsible populist.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in his fourth month in office, he seems to have won
over even the skeptics. And if the applause was not boisterous, it
was nonetheless ample. The most frequently expressed opinion was
that Kim had thus far handled the crisis well.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kim arrived on Saturday and stayed overnight at the
Intercontinental Hotel in New York under tight security, which was
equally intense in Cliffside Park. In the morning, he attended Mass
at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and met with Cardinal John O'Connor
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, he was honored at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York, where he helped dedicate a new gallery of Korean
art. On Monday, Kim is scheduled to visit the New York Stock
Exchange, where he can be counted on to underline a likely theme of
this visit: reassurance to foreign investors. After New York, he
goes to Washington for meetings with President Clinton and a speech
to Congress, before journeying on to Los Angeles.

SPORTS COLUMN: BULLS HAVE THE HORSES TO WIN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Indulge me while I clear out the Belmont Stakes
residue, but I do not see Michael Jordan and the Bulls fading in
the homestretch with another Triple Crown now in sight.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the trailer has to believe it has the ability to
catch up, but from the sight of the Utah Jazz in the second half
here Sunday night, what we appear to have on our hands is a
pre-race favorite running without faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz didn't just quit Game 3 of the National Basketball
Association finals. They were dismissed from it. The only mail that
was delivered was the game itself, post-marked by the Jazz, Salt
Lake City. Just when people were forecasting photo finishes between
teams rated evenly matched, the Bulls charged ahead late in the
first half and blew on like a tropical storm in a 96-54 slaughter
that gave them a 2-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz could have been suffering the effects of having their
grand design for this series ruined by their Game 2 loss Friday
night at home. All the more reason why this team needed to be right
back in the Bulls' faces Sunday night. They went face down on the
United Center floor instead, losing the most lopsided finals game
ever, scoring the fewest points since the shot clock rule and
fueling the notion that, deep down, they don't believe they can
beat the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we could win last year but to say we don't
this year would be wrong,'' Jeff Hornacek argued. Given 54 points,
this sounded much like the rhetoric about Karl Malone's missed
shots that cost Utah its home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Same shots he always takes, the Jazz said. Same ones he always
makes. The problem with that rationale is that it fails to
acknowledge the psychological component of trying to wrest the
crown off Jordan's head. This is not the typical opponent. This is
not the customary setting. This is not the ordinary challenge, and
that not only goes for Malone but the entire Utah team.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of its best player, from the time Malone has been
playing basketball on the national level, he has been the
quintessential outsider. First he was that muscular kid from little
Louisiana Tech, a school best known for its women's teams. For much
of his professional career, he has been looked at by many of his
peers as the Brother From Another Planet. The African-American
superstar who plays in the whitest of all NBA markets, the
down-home Louisiana guy who drives bikes and trucks, not Range
Rovers and Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Mailman Malone stands alone, unless he's communing with John
Stockton on the pick-and-roll. That's been his message, and he has
delivered his share of politically incorrect diatribes, on subjects
ranging from Magic Johnson's popular return in 1992 (he thought it
wasn't a good idea) to the league's formerly hailed drug policy (he
thought it wasn't getting the job done). But these last two
springs, finally making it to the finals, Malone has found himself
face-to-face with the ultimate establishment icon. It has become
immeasurably difficult to have his say in the face of true
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they have been the same shots, or maybe they have been
just a step or two deeper, or maybe he's been rushing to take the
quick shot because he knows the Bulls' suffocating Eastern
Conference defense will not give him one that's better. Patrick
Ewing could tell Malone how the ball feels so much more slippery
when the Bulls are swarming, the way they were Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was determined to make a statement Sunday night, and
started to by connecting on his first six shots, remembering there
is nothing mystical about Luc Longley's slow-footed defense. Malone
scored 12 first-quarter points, but when he looked up at the
scoreboard, the Jazz had 14 and were trailing by three.
</P>
<P>
   This raised another sobering issue: the Bulls' ability to
control Stockton's dribble penetration with their long-limbed
defenders. Stockton is not as quick as he used to be, and this
becomes much more noticeable against a defensive-minded Eastern
Conference team than it does against anyone out West.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six minutes of the second quarter, the Jazz's
offense devolved into the Knicks'. Malone, quiet after Dennis
Rodman relieved Longley, ran over Scottie Pippen on the break.
Bryon Russell turned a simple and uncontested inbounds pass to
Stockton into a backcourt violation. Stockton lost the ball deep in
the lane. Malone traveled in the post, then threw up an air ball in
the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture? The Bulls did. Jordan and Toni Kukoc
immediately began abusing their men off the dribble. When Kukoc
penetrates the way he did Sunday night, forget it, Chicago's
sportswriters may as well begin the campaign to keep this group
together until 2010. Jordan and the 6-foot-11-inch Kukoc in the
lane with the ball are a different story than the frail Hornacek
and Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   How bad did it get for Malone and Utah? He was called twice by
Hue Hollins for charging on the break against Hollins' favorite
player, Pippen. The Bulls cruised into halftime with a 49-31 lead,
by far the largest lead in the series. The second half, from the
shellshocked perception of Jerry Sloan, bordered on disgrace.
Uncontested Chicago dunks. Jordan and Pippen resting on the bench
with impish smiles that gave way to raucous laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were cruising, pulling ahead in the finals in the
backstretch. This is a team that has never been caught from behind.

A JURY'S DIFFICULT PASSAGE TOWARD A VERDICT OF DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She has been haunted by many things these last few
days. The image of a woman pleading for her life, so that her five
children would not be left motherless. The photograph of a man
twisted under a bar stool, unsuccessfully trying to shield himself
from a robber's bullet. The smirk on the lips of Darrel K. Harris
as witnesses identified him as the killer of three people at a
Brooklyn social club _ Club Happiness.
</P>
<P>
   And there was another picture, a snapshot from the life of the
49-year-old woman, a juror in Harris' trial, who spoke briefly and
reluctantly Sunday on the condition that her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a time when she had been sick, near death, and
terrified of leaving her teen-age son behind. So she put herself in
the shoes of the woman, Evelyn Davis, who had begged Harris not to
kill her. He stabbed her in the back, because he had used up his
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The juror said that when she began deliberating Harris' fate
four days ago, more than half the panel of five men and seven women
in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn _ herself included _ opposed
sentencing him to death.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday morning, after turning to her Bible and praying
to her God, the juror added her voice to those who decided that
Harris should die by lethal injection. If carried out, it will be
the first execution in New York State since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I felt, knowing I had a 14-year-old boy who would
have to live without a mother,'' the juror said yesterday
afternoon, after coming home from church. ``I could not have done
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture of that woman begging him, begging him to let her
go, after he had no bullets left,'' she added, recounting the
evidence presented by the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
``And he said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 40-year-old former correction officer, received a
citation from the city in 1987 for saving the life of a fellow
guard during a riot at a Brooklyn jail. On May 19, he was convicted
of first-degree murder in the deaths of three people at Club
Happiness, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Harris, describing him as a man with severe
psychological problems and an addiction to alcohol and cocaine, had
pressed jurors to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have already filed a motion challenging the
constitutionality of death by lethal injection, and an appeal of
the sentence is expected soon. The death penalty was reinstated in
New York in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will never be known exactly what led the panel to
send Harris to the death chamber. Certainly, Sunday, few on the
12-member panel wanted to repeat or reflect on what went on inside
the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, David McCallum, escorted a reporter away from his
Crown Heights home, saying only that the decision had been one of
the most difficult experiences of his life. McCallum said he was
ultimately persuaded to impose the death penalty by the brutality
of Harris' crimes. ``It was just too cruel for words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Patrick Obazee, said he had no interest in revisiting
the deliberations, except to describe it as ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their precise reasons, the sentence they rendered
appeared to have been laced with ambivalence. They deliberated for
22 hours over four days. On Friday, a court officer informed Acting
Justice Anne Feldman of flared tempers inside the jury room. On
Saturday afternoon, as the jury forewoman read the verdict, one
woman on the panel began sobbing so uncontrollably that she nearly
collapsed. Two of the jurors noted in their verdict report that
Harris had suffered from some emotional distress, though that did
not, in their minds, sufficiently mitigate the crimes for which he
was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the cool reticence that Harris maintained through the
end help his cause. When a witness who managed to escape his
rampage took the stand, Harris smiled, showing no remorse, recalled
the juror who spoke on condition of anonymity. And although his
mother testified in his behalf and his brother, an ordained
minister, asked the jury to spare his life, Harris chose not to
testify even in the sentencing phase of his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he could have said something to us,'' the juror said.
``A lot of people thought about that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Harris' lawyer, Russell Neufeld, said Sunday that he and his
client decided against testifying because the judge had ruled that
the prosecution would have the final say _ in stark contrast to
noncapital crimes cases, in which the defendant is allowed to
testify last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a deprivation of what we thought was a
significant right,'' Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' next court appearance is scheduled for June 23, when he
will be formally sentenced by Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was convicted of murdering Jerome Sims, the manager of
Club Happiness, and Michael Harris, who was no relation, during a
robbery of the club. He shot both men in the head, and when he ran
out of bullets, stabbed Ms. Davis in the back. A witness, Newbry
Mitchell, testified that Ms. Davis screamed: ``Please, please, let
me out! I have five babies to take care of!''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had conceded that Harris was responsible for the
murders, but not because he wanted to eliminate witnesses, as the
prosecution had argued.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the defense had argued, Harris suffered from serious
psychological problems, including those that stemmed from having
been severely beaten as a child by his mother, as well as addiction
to alcohol and cocaine. The jail riot had traumatic effects, the
defense had contended, and the city Correction Department forced
Harris to resign in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict drew polar responses. Gov. George Pataki, whose 1994
campaign was based partly on support for the death penalty, and who
signed into law the measure reinstating the penalty soon after
taking office, said the sentence would send a powerful message to
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will face the risk of losing their own life if they take
another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario Cuomo, the former governor, who vetoed capital
punishment legislation in each of his 12 years in office, called
the verdict wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the death penalty is popular among a lot of
people,'' he said. ``But remember, 90 percent of the people once
approved of slavery.''

SEARCH FOR 2 FUGITIVES IS SCALED BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (mk) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUFF, Utah _ Police reopened this small San Juan River town to
traffic from the outside Sunday morning and said they would cut
back their search for two armed fugitives who are suspects in the
killing of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Mike Lacy of San Juan County said he made the decision
to scale back the search after Saturday brought no sightings of
Alan Pilon, 30, of Dove Creek, Colo., or Jason Wayne McVean, 26, of
Durango, Colo. The two men have been sought since May 29 as
suspects in the killing of one police officer and the shooting of
three others.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people have been looking for the fugitives, including
Navajo trackers and National Guardsmen who have provided infrared
and night-vision observation equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Officers are using maps found among the suspects' belongings to
search for caves and other places they might have hidden food,
water and other supplies in the parched arroyos and canyons of the
Four Corners region of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. They
searched a mine on Saturday, Lacy said.
</P>
<P>
   The search began in Cortez, Colo., where three men in camouflage
clothing killed a city police officer and wounded two sheriff's
deputies in the ensuing pursuit and gun battle. Last Thursday, the
search shifted to the area near Bluff when a sheriff's deputy here
was shot and one of the suspects, Robert Matthew Mason, 26, of
Durango, was found dead from a bullet wound at a campsite near
town. Authorities believe that Mason committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Bluff was evacuated on Thursday afternoon. Residents were
allowed to return on Saturday, but outsiders were barred until 10
a.m. Sunday. Police officers continued to stand guard at roadblocks
at the four entrances to the town and asked visitors not to pick up
anyone or give anyone a ride out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Galen Headley, who owns the Cadillac Ranch R.V. Park here, said
he evacuated the park but decided to stay at home instead of
spending Thursday night with the 230 other residents who left town.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys had a heck of a job to do,'' he said of the police
with whom he shared the largely empty town. ``Those who criticize
them should be the ones to beat the bushes and find these guys.''

SENATOR SAYS CHINA TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Utah)  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee
said Sunday that testimony to the panel last week in closed session
showed that the Chinese government had planned to influence the
1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., added that it
remained unclear whether the efforts were actually carried out. His
comments were based on testimony by Attorney General Janet Reno,
CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they influenced it, but I think they tried to
influence it,'' Shelby said, speaking of China, in an interview
aired on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's two different things,'' Shelby said. ``There's
a lot of information out there that they were involved, trying to
get involved. Of course, a lot of nations try to do that, but in
this particular one, it went to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's remarks, his first public comment on the subject,
echoed findings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
last year concluded that Beijing had tried to influence American
elections. But that committee, headed by Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., also uncovered scant evidence that the plan had been
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's committee hearings last week were the first formal
congressional sessions on the China Plan, as it is known, since the
disclosure that Johnny Chung, a Democratic Party fund-raiser, had
told Justice Department investigators that a large portion of the
nearly $100,000 that he raised for the Democrats came from an
official with close ties to the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
   The money came from Liu Chaoying, a Chinese army lieutenant
colonel who also is an official of a Chinese aerospace company. Her
father was a high-ranking general and Communist Party official.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's hearings were the first of a number of planned
congressional inquiries into accusations concerning campaign
fund-raising and the Clinton administration's decision-making
process in allowing the launching of civilian American satellites
on Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is looking into Chung's disclosures along
with whether two satellite makers _ Loral Space and Communications
and Hughes Electronics _ illegally gave China space expertise that
allowed Beijing to more accurately aim its nuclear missiles. The
issue of the transfer of technology arose after a Chinese rocket
carrying a $200 million Loral satellite was launched in China on
Feb. 15, 1996, and exploded seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   China asked Loral and some experts from Hughes to conduct an
independent review of the accident. It was in the course of the
review that some administration officials raised questions about
how much information had been turned over to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Schwartz, the Loral chairman, contributed more than $1
million to Democratic political campaigns in the last election.
Schwartz and other Loral officials denied the donations were an
effort to influence administration decisions on Loral's satellite
deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said he was willing to accept Schwartz's
statement. Hatch said on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation''
that while there is ``some evidence that favors may have been
granted'' in the satellite deal, ``we're not convinced at this
point'' that national security was compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the intelligence committee uncovered evidence of
conflicting views on the subject within the administration. A CIA
review concluded that the companies had not disclosed information
to China that damaged national security. But an intelligence arm of
the State Department found that the disclosure had placed American
security interests at risk.

COMMENTARY: IN ALBANY, MR. RULES AND POWER

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If only Bertrand Russell had known about the
meetings of the Assembly Rules Committee, he might never have had
to invent the bald king of France.
</P>
<P>
   Both belong to that curious class of things that hover somewhere
between nonsense and fiction; they are, to use Russell's words,
``denoting phrases that denote nothing.'' For just as there is no
present king of France, depilated or otherwise, there are no
meetings of the New York State Assembly Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee does have members; indeed, its 26 Democrats and 12
Republicans make it the Legislature's largest. It also has
responsibilities, in fact, arguably more than any other Assembly
committee. During the last few frenzied weeks of a session, when
most legislation finally reaches the floor for a vote, it is up to
the Rules Committee to set the agenda. It has the power to move a
bill forward or, just as significant, hold one back, thereby
killing it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee openly acknowledge that they do not
meet or vote and that they have no room assigned for their
nonexistent deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   They also make no secret of where the work of the committee is
really being done, or who is doing it. They jokingly refer to the
Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, as Mr. Rules. And the committee,
they like to say, meets between his ears.
</P>
<P>
   This year there has been a lot of talk here about a new era of
openness, about the democratization of the Capitol, about an
unparalleled shift of power from the legislative leaders to
rank-and-file members. After all, ordinary Joe Six-Pack legislators
were actually allowed to discuss the budget in conference
committees this spring and to offer their suggestions. This,
lawmakers all agreed, was a big improvement over last year, when
they were not even told what was in the budget until negotiations
were safely concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic,'' Silver declared when the conference committees
were formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic,'' the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno,
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ``meetings'' of the Assembly Rules Committee
indicate, Albany still has a long way to go before it can serve as
anybody's model of democracy in action. For all of the talk of the
new openness, the business of the Legislature is still basically
conducted behind closed doors, in phone calls between the
Democratic speaker and the Republican Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   So tight is their control over their respective houses that
practically no vote is taken in either the Assembly or the Senate
in which the outcome has not been determined in advance. On
occasion, a lawmaker may vote against his party, but it is expected
that he will first get permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As this session heads toward recess, there are few signs these
habits are changing. Lawmakers say they expect the session, like
those before it, to end in an all-night marathon. They expect bills
that they have never had a chance to read to suddenly pop out of
the Rules Committee. And they fully expect to approve them.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of how well established this political culture is
that even members of the Rules Committee largely accept its odd
ontological status as a matter of course, a subject more fit for
humor than outrage or embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attend every meeting I am called to,'' joked Assemblyman
Richard Gottfried, D-New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, another New York City Democrat,
defended the phantom committee, saying, ``I think everyone is
perfectly comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only objections come, predictably, from Republicans, who are
in the Assembly minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's moving through that august body,'' said
Assemblyman George Winner Jr., R-Elmira, who is also a member of
the Rules Committee. ``Shelly waves his hands and _ poof!''
</P>
<P>
   Winner recalled that a few years ago, there was a push to change
the Assembly rules and force the Rules Committee to meet. Not
surprisingly, the change, sponsored by the minority, was, at the
request of the leadership, smothered by the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why an entire committee should exist and yet
never convene, Silver's spokeswoman, Pat Lynch, said it had ever
been thus. Evidently reading from a prepared statement, she
described the Rules Committee merely as ``a leadership tool to
facilitate the flow of the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' she added, ``what it is.''

LAWYERS FOR CONDEMNED MAN TO APPEAL DEATH PENALTY DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The constitutionality of New York State's untested
1995 capital punishment law and what the defense considers a
judge's flawed conduct of the murder trial of Darrel Harris will be
the focus of the condemned man's historic appeal, his chief trial
lawyer and other legal experts said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a jury in Brooklyn sentenced the 40-year-old former
jail guard to die by lethal injection for killing three people in a
botched 1996 robbery at an illegal social club, lawyers for Harris
were already mapping strategy for an appeal to the state's highest
tribunal, the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is likely to take years, experts said, and is
expected to be the crucial test of the state's three-year-old death
penalty law: not only deciding whether it is lawful under the
federal and New York State Constitutions, but also setting a host
of legal standards, from the way judges conduct capital trials to
the propriety of using injections in executions.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal's prospects were clouded in uncertainty, experts
said, not only because of the complexity of the issues to be
decided, but also because the composition of the Court of Appeals
is soon to change, with the most liberal of its seven members,
Judge Vito Titone, resigning this month, and a more conservative
replacement expected to be appointed by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   One expert, Vincent Bonventre, a professor at the Albany Law
School who is an authority on the Court of Appeals, said that the
pending judicial change was ``absolutely critical,'' and would most
likely tip a delicate balance in favor of upholding the death
penalty law. ``I'm pretty certain this statute could not have
passed with Titone on the court,'' he said. ``Without him, the odds
are in favor of approving this statute.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Doyle, the state's capital defender, whose office is
expected to pursue the appeal for Harris, gave another view: ``One
might fear that the more conservative makeup of the court would
hurt the first capital case. But in fact even with a more
conservative court, the standard they set now will be the one they
will live with, and they are going to be very prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I am confident that this death sentence is not going
to stand.'' Doyle's office, created by the state legislature and
funded by the state to insure that defendants in capital cases are
adequately represented, has a 50-member staff. A team selected and
directed by Doyle will probably file the appeal, assisted by Legal
Aid lawyers who represented Harris in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes was expected to argue
against the appeal, with assistance from New York State Attorney
General Dennis Vacco. Jonathan Frank, the assistant district
attorney who led the prosecution of Harris, voiced confidence that
the statute and the verdict would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   While details of the appeal are yet to be determined, some of
the issues that may be raised were discussed in interviews Sunday
by Harris' chief Legal Aid lawyer during the trial, Russell
Neufeld, and by Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Among the constitutional issues that may be raised, the defense
lawyers said, are questions over the criteria used by prosecutors
to select capital cases for trial, about the composition of juries
in capital cases, about the wording judges use in charging such
juries and about whether lethal injections cause inhumane pain and
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld noted that the New York law, unlike death penalty
statutes in 37 other states, specified no guidelines for
prosecutors in selecting which cases to bring to trial. ``A
district attorney in Manhattan may be hesitant to go forward, while
another across the river in Brooklyn is not so reticent,'' he said.
``There is no way to achieve statewide uniformity. It just gives
too much unbridled discretion to prosecutors, and it winds up being
arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the appeal might contend that rules promulgated by
the State Department of Correctional Services for giving lethal
injections appeared to violate constitutional prohibitions against
cruel and unusual punishment. The defense during the trial had
argued that the rules ``fall short even of state regulations on
ehthanizing laboratory rats.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While an appeal was not expected to reargue many of the issues
decided by the trial jury, the lawyers said it would contend that
many of the rulings by Acting Justice Anne Feldman in State Supreme
Court deprived Harris of a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, citing an example, noted that the law requires a jury,
after a conviction in a capital case, to decide unanimously in a
separate deliberation either to invoke the death penalty or impose
life in prison without possibilty of parole; if it fails to do
either unanimously, the trial judge is authorized to impose a
sentence of 20 or 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   During the deliberations over Harris' fate, Doyle and Neufeld
said, the jury asked Judge Feldman whether Harris would
automatically be sentenced to life without parole if it failed to
reach a unanimous decision. ``The judge answered `No,' just the one
word,'' Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   While she was technically correct, he said, the jury might have
been told that the judge would impose the sentence prescribed by
law. As a practical matter, if the judge had passed sentenced,
Harris might have been given three consecutive terms of 25 years to
life because he had killed three people. The defense asked the
judge to give a fuller explanation, he said, fearing the jury might
conclude that Harris would receive a lesser sentence, and perhaps
regain freedom or get a new trial if the jury did not reach a
unanimous decision. The judge refused, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unfair,'' he said. ``It put a coercive burden on the
jury: they'd have to be unanimous about the death penalty or there
might be a do-over.''

COUNCIL SAYS IT CAN FIND BUDGET'S MISSING MILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The skirmishes over New York City's next budget
continued Sunday as City Council leaders ventured into the
labyrinthine world of property taxes to patch a $251 million hole
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had blown into their budget a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani's aides fiercely attacked the Council's
budget as illegal. They described Council members as spendthrifts
who had increased spending on themselves in the last four years
even as the mayor's office had substantially lowered its own
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   These were the latest shots in a battle that erupted on Friday,
when the Council defied Giuliani by adopting a budget without his
endorsement. On Saturday, the mayor countered by announcing that
expected revenue for next year would fall short of earlier
estimates by $251 million. The move was intended to force the
Council either to accept eventual spending vetoes by the mayor or
raise property taxes _ the only tax over which the legislative body
has control _ to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Peter Vallone, the Council speaker, said Sunday
night that the Council had another response up its sleeve. It will
meet Monday morning and, turning to an arcane section of the city's
property tax law, draw the $251 million from a reserve fund that
covers property tax shortfalls, the aides said. Taxes will not go
up, they insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will pay more as a result of the actions that the City
Council is taking,'' said Thomas McMahon, the City Council's
finance director. ``Property tax is the most complicated tax in the
world, and it's being used by the City Council to one-up the Office
of Management and Budget,'' the mayor's budget office.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the mayor and his top aides bunkered down inside
City Hall, as Giuliani prepared to use, for the first time in his
mayoralty, his line-item veto power and slash as much as $200
million from the $34.08 billion spending plan. In the budgetary tit
for tat, the mayor's office said that it had conjured up ``six
scenarios'' to respond to any maneuver by the Council, and
predicted victory as long the Council did not come up with a
seventh counter-attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The escalating fight over $251 million _ which represents
seven-tenths of a percent of the $34.08 billion budget _
underscored yet again how political hostilities have complicated
the annual budget negotiations between Giuliani and Vallone, who
until now shared harmonious relations and, in the recession of the
mid-1990s, were able to agree on deep cuts in services in almost
every area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year _ and especially this fiscal year, which is
expected to end June 30 with a record $2 billion surplus _ budget
officials from both sides might have settled such picayune
differences over drinks at one of the many bars near City Hall. And
the agreement would have been announced at a carefully orchestrated
photo opportunity, with Vallone and Giuliani flashing smiles at
television cameras, shaking hands and slapping backs.
</P>
<P>
   But budget talks collapsed last Monday amid much chest-beating
and a political deadlock. The mayor, who wants to use city money to
help build a new home for the New York Yankees, possibly on the
West Side of Manhattan, wanted Vallone to drop his call for a
November referendum on the issue. But the speaker refused, saying
the referendum had nothing to do with budget talks. Vallone, who is
seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, has a political
base strongly opposes any suggestion of moving the Yankees out of
the Bronx into Manhattan; what's more, in a general race against
Gov. George Pataki, a referendum on the November ballot would
increase voter turnout in Democratic strongholds like the Bronx and
Manhattan.

   NEW YORK _ For The Daily News, the rainbow of new color pages is
still somewhere over the rainbow, and the search for the best way
to keep the color inks free of water continues, but the lawsuit
that the paper's parent company filed against the company that
supplied the balky newsliner presses is over.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release issued Wednesday, spokesmen for Goss Graphics
Systems said the company was ``extremely pleased with this swift

Ira Gammerman, dismissed all counts of the lawsuit that was filed

   (NYT11) WASHINGTON -- June 7, 1998 -- DEMS-FUNDRAISING, 6-7 --
Rep. Albert Wynn of Maryland, is one of several House Democrats who
may buck the party on the overhaul of campaign finance laws. The
three-term congressman is balancing his doubts against party
loyalty. ``I consider myself a team player,'' he says, ``and I've

   (NYT4) NEW YORK -- June 7, 1998 -- SNOWMAIDEN-BALLET-REVIEW, 6-7
-- Nina Ananiashvili and Angel Corella, in the American Ballet
Theater production of ``The Snow Maiden,'' at the Metropolitan
Opera House. ``The Snow Maiden's'' plot is drawn from Aleksandr
Ostrovsky's ``Snegurochka'' (''The Snow Maiden''), an 1873 play
based on Slavic folk stories, with incidental music by Tchaikovsky.
Despite all of the lilting snow maidens, leaping reindeer and
cavorting villagers, it is an intimate story and romantic ballet.

   (NYT3) LONDON -- June 7, 1998 -- BAKER-INTERVIEW, 6-7 --
Nicholson Baker, an author of many reputations. Baker's latest
novel is ``The Everlasting Story of Nory,'' which describes the
relatively uneventful life of an imaginative 9-year-old American
girl spending a year in England. ``Every book I've written I've
tried to make very different from the one before,'' says Baker.
``I'd like to have all my books make the same point -- and it's
kind of a stupid point, really -- that a single human being can
think about a lot of different things. (Jonathan Player/New York

   (NYT2) NEW YORK -- June 7, 1998 -- TV-NBC-SHAPIRO, 6-7 -- Neal
Shapiro, the executive producer of ``Dateline NBC,'' is expanding
the program to five nights a week. As its success has grown,
``Dateline'' has reshaped how entertainment executives view news
magazines. One main element of the success of ``Dateline'' has been
its willingness to drop everything and chase like a thundering herd
after whatever story is driving daily coverage. ``We do stories on
the things people are talking about,'' says Shapiro. ``The stories
that are in the public consciousness.'' (Fred R. Conrad/New York

   (NYT1) WASHINGTON -- June 7, 1998 -- HDTV-FCC, 6-7 -- Susan
Ness, commissioner of an FCC task force on high-definition
television. Ms. Ness is trying to ease the transition to HDTV by
helping TV stations build towers for digital antennas needed for
transmission. Twenty-six network-owned television stations in the
nation's 10 largest cities are scheduled to begin digital
broadcasting by Nov. 1, and almost every major manufacturer of
televisions plans to introduce HDTV sets by then. ``For competitive
reasons, some broadcasters might not want to say publicly that they
are having problems,'' says Ms. Ness. ``In those cases we can
help.'' (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo)

Rep. Albert Wynn of Maryland, is one of several House Democrats who
may buck the party on the overhaul of campaign finance laws. The
three-term congressman is balancing his doubts against party
loyalty. ``I consider myself a team player,'' he says, ``and I've

Janice Davocato's devotion to her disabled mother, Sylvia, 76, has
wiped out her savings and turned her into a seven-day-a-week
workhorse. Janice Davocato has been taking care of her mother, ever
since a fall left her in a wheelchair 12 years ago. Healthcare
costs have devoured Ms. Davocato's savings and now consume a third
of her income. ``I had $30,000 saved from all my years of
working,'' she says. ``That's gone.'' Mrs. Davocato, who was a
housewife, has no savings, and meager Social Security benefits.

   (NYT8) WEST TIMOR, Indonesia -- June 7, 1998 -- ASIA-ECON-3, 6-7
-- With Asia's financial crisis comes hunger, malnutrition,
sickness and death. In West Timor, Wilhelmina Boemao, right,
prepares putak, the wood of a kind of palm tree that grows wild,
for eating. The economic crisis has coincided with crippling
droughts caused by El Nino currents. So rain has not fallen and
crops have failed, particularly in eastern Indonesia. With no rice
and corn, villagers are turning in desperation to anything edible.
``In the past I used putak to feed pigs, and even they didn't like
it,'' says Miss Boemao. (Nicholas D. Kristof/New York Times Photo)

Devaluation of the Thai currency, has left Som Chianda and his wife
Sanguan, praying at a Budhist altar, unable to afford medicine for
their son, Lamkwan, 32, in rear. Lamkwan suffers from a severe lung
ailment, and doctors have prescribed a medicine that has kept the
sickness in check for three years. But the cost of the medecine has
soared from $50 to $120 a month, leaving them hopeless. ``The
heaviest feeling in the world is to have no money, to be unable to
help our own son,'' says Mrs. Chianda. (Nicholas D. Kristof/New

   (NYT6) BAN WAN YAI, Thailand -- June 7, 1998 -- ASIA-ECON-1, 6-7
-- The Asian financial crisis is forcing Bangon Phailak to choose
between food for her 4-year-old daughter, Saiyamon, who has become
anemic and malnourished, and life-saving surgery for herself. In
the 11 months since the crisis exploded in Thailand and began
spreading through the region, the worst off are those like Mrs.
Bangon, who were already at the margins of society. ``A year ago,
at least we had enough rice,'' says Mrs. Bangon. ``These days, we
don't even have enough to eat.'' (Nicholas D. Kristoff/New York

   ASIA-ECON (Ban Wan Yai, Thailand) _ In the 11 months since the
economic crisis exploded in Thailand and began spreading through

those who had almost nothing before and who now, somehow, have even
less. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

<P>
   ITALY-POMPEII (Pompeii, Italy) _ There are two Pompeiis on the
bay of Naples, and it is not always clear which is the dead city.

percent, boasts crumbling buildings, faded hontytonk signs, old
people and stray dogs sleeping in the sun. A journal by Alessandra
Stanley.

   ELDERLY-CARE (Philadelphia) _ As Americans continue to live
longer than ever, growing numbers of elderly people and their
families are being caught in the gap between the cost of long-term

anti-smoking crusade.

<P>
   TV-CNN-MEDIA (Undated) _ It is hard to know what came first _
the idea of partnerships between Time-Warner's weekly magazines and

BELMONT SETS UP SUMMER OF 3-YEAR-OLD RIVALRIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Victory Gallop has a more important and prominent nose than
Cyrano de Bergerac or Pinocchio. His narrow margin of victory in
Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park not only prevented
Real Quiet from capturing the Triple Crown _ and a $5 million bonus
_ but it also reopened the race for championship honors among this
year's talented crop of 3-year-olds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had Real Quiet won, he would have been assured an Eclipse Award
as the champion 3-year-old. Now, a number of colts _ including
Victory Gallop, Coronado's Quest, Indian Charlie and even Lil's Lad
and Favorite Trick _ are back in the running, and their presence
offers promise of dramatic matches in a series of important races
for 3-year-olds in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet and Victory Gallop emerged as the best of their
generation through a thrilling series of races in the Triple Crown.
They were one-two in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and
Belmont, with Real Quiet winning two of the three, and their
rivalry should continue this summer. Their trainers said the
$750,000 Travers Stakes _ at the Derby distance of a mile and
one-quarter on Aug. 29 at Saratoga _ is their next major objective.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, and Real Quiet's
trainer, Bob Baffert, said Sunday morning at Belmont that their
colts emerged from Saturday's thrilling race tired but in good
health. Walden felt a sense of accomplishment for having stayed the
course on the Triple Crown trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great feeling getting there after running second
twice,'' Walden said. ``It would have been difficult to be second
in all three races, especially when you think you're due.''
</P>
<P>
   After a night to sleep on the result, Baffert still refused to
second-guess anything with Real Quiet, from his own training to the
ride of Kent Desormeaux. Baffert missed the Triple Crown last year
when Silver Charm ran second in the Belmont after taking the Derby
and Preakness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was pretty let down,'' he said. ``This time, we
just got beat. He was ready. He ran great.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet left Belmont at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and was flown to
Louisville, Ky., and Churchill Downs, where he will rest for a week
before rejoining Baffert's large stable in Southern California.
Victory Gallop is flying to Kentucky, where Walden is based. But
both will be headed East again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop is likely to make his next start in the $1
million Haskell Invitational at a mile and one-eighth at New
Jersey's Monmouth Park on Aug. 9, then go to the Travers, Walden
said. Baffert said Real Quiet would definitely be at the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the $5 million got away, I've got to nickel and dime
for it,'' said Baffert, whose 10 percent share of the bonus would
have been $500,000. ``I told my wife we're stuck in our house for
another year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baffert will send out a one-two punch against Victory Gallop in
August. He is pointing Indian Charlie to the Haskell, which will
mark that colt's first start since he finished third as the
favorite in the Kentucky Derby. ``You might see both my colts in
the Haskell,'' Baffert said, though it is more likely that only
Indian Charlie will run there.
</P>
<P>
   Also ticketed for a trip to the Haskell is the mercurial
Coronado's Quest, who returned to action on Saturday and won the
seven-furlong Riva Ridge Stakes on the Belmont undercard.
Coronado's Quest has had a spring filled with high drama. His
erratic behavior compromised his chances in races in Florida
earlier this year and led to a decision not to run him in the
Kentucky Derby. Then he was scratched from the Preakness because of
a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest's victory on Saturday was efficient if
unspectacular, but his deportment _ before 80,162 fans _ was
exemplary in both the saddling paddock and post parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had had two months off, and there was a bump in the road,''
said the trainer Shug McGaughey, referring to the foot bruise, ``so
to be able to come back and handle the situation as well as he did,
and run as well as he did, pleased me. We got a good, solid race
into him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Coronado's Quest would run once before the Haskell, in
Belmont's $150,000 Dwyer Stakes, at a mile and one-sixteenth, on
July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick also is expected to run in the Dwyer. The 1997
Horse of the Year, he has not raced since finishing eighth in the
Kentucky Derby.

   Lil's Lad, who was disqualified from victory in the Florida
Derby earlier this year, will join the party last of all. He needed
minor ankle surgery after his second-place finish in the Blue Grass
Stakes, and only in the past week has he gone back to the track to
train. His trainer, Neil Howard, said Lil's Lad probably would not
be ready to race until late August or early September, near the end
of the Saratoga meeting.

A MUSICIAN ADAPTS TO DECLINE IN JOB OFFERS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a nod to the audience, Jeff Ausfahl got ready to
play. As gigs go, the crowd was awfully young. Appropriately, he
began with ``I'm Popeye the Sailor Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub of chatter stopped. As Ausfahl strummed his guitar,
the roisterous kindergartners at Public School 114 in the Bronx
lifted their faces in delight. Accompanying him were Brian Grice on
the drums and Sue Terry on the flute. Between songs, they taught
the rudiments of their instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this made of?'' Ausfahl asked as he held his guitar
aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood,'' chirped a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right. Now how many strings does it have?''
</P>
<P>
   A girl guessed three, half the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   The trio performed an Aesop fable set to music. They distributed
maracas for the children to shake along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a far cry from a real gig, huh?'' Ausfahl said as the
children filed out. ``Isn't the club date business great?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ausfahl has played the guitar professionally for 25 years.
He is what is known as a club date musician, who primarily performs
at single engagements like weddings and private parties. A highly
malleable guitarist, he can play everything from dance to rock to
classical to merengue to polkas. He plays songs of contagious cheer
and songs with a lot of ache in them, though he no longer gets to
perform anywhere as much as he would like to. Such is the sharply
altered shape of the musician's life in a world more in thrall to
canned music than live.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Ausfahl, at 43, finds himself doing about 75 gigs a
year in front of schoolchildren, arranged through Music Outreach, a
nonprofit outfit that puts on music demonstrations in public
schools in New York. The audience is highly appreciative. He needs
the work.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an evolving decline in jobs for live musicians,
caught in the undertow of disc jockeys spinning CDs on much
improved sound systems and a more thrift-minded economy.
</P>
<P>
   Local 802, the New York chapter of the American Federation of
Musicians, to which Ausfahl belongs, says union club dates in the
city have tumbled to about 6,000 a year from as many as 15,000 15
years ago. The union reports that the bar mitzvah business and
lower-end weddings have been almost totally lost to DJs, who
generally cost a fraction of what a band does.
</P>
<P>
   Far fewer musicians find themselves able to play full time
anymore. Many teach. And it has become axiomatic among union
musicians that they must accept nonunion jobs to eat, a practice
the union tolerates.
</P>
<P>
   It is not strictly economics that has brought on this state of
affairs. Many people do not want to hear someone who sounds like
Bruce Springsteen or Elton John. They want Bruce Springsteen or
Elton John, even if he is coming out of a box.
</P>
<P>
   One can sometimes go to a $200-a-plate dinner today and be
entertained by a music system. Years ago, the size of the band was
a mark of the status of an event. The work was so copious that it
was hard to find enough musicians. Bands enlisted ``phantoms,''
nonplayers who simply held instruments to swell the size of the
band. Saxophone players were known to pick up violins and apply
soap to the bows so no sound would emerge as they ``played.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, musicians have come to feel like very expensive
bottles of wine, tasted less and less often.
</P>
<P>
   It was a languid Monday void of gigs, and Ausfahl was working on
the attic of the tidy Teaneck, N.J., house that he shares with his
wife, Janet, and a parakeet named Henry. Ausfahl is a sinewy,
genial man with longish hair and sharply chiseled features.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a wedding yesterday with just a flutist,'' he said
ruefully. ``We played just the ceremony. When we left, the DJ
started.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of DJs causes him to snort with indignation.
Brusquely, he said: ``It does bug me. It bugs a lot of people. I'm
not mad at anyone. I just want to make a living. You know, it
started out that the records were to sound like the bands. Then it
got to where the bands were supposed to sound like the records. Now
they just need the records.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Ausfahl played 250 to 300 club dates a year.
These days he is lucky to get 100, plus his school jobs. His single
biggest source of work is Lester Lanin Orchestras, the society band
group. ``I also work for his competitors,'' Ausfahl said. ``I have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   His year of greatest income was 1993, when he made about
$60,000. The next year, he earned less than half that, but lately
he has rebounded to about $40,000 a year. ``I had some 10 years or
so where I would be idle at most one or two Saturday nights,'' he
said. ``Now I'm idle 20 or more Saturdays.''
</P>
<P>
   He never imagined this constricted condition when he embarked on
his free-form career. He was born in Peoria, Ill., where his father
was a factory manager for Caterpillar, the tractor maker. Ausfahl
started guitar lessons when he was 10. At 13, he was playing in a
band at school sock hops. ``When you're young, you want to find
your self-worth somewhere,'' he said. ``I tried a bunch of things
and I was good at this.''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually received a degree from Berklee College of Music in
Boston, after several interruptions. For a spell, he played rock
music at bars and Holiday Inn lounges. For eight months in 1975, he
joined a band in Chicago called Even Steven. The musicians wore
silver satin suits and played soul music. One summer, he journeyed
to Virginia Beach and played military bases and wet T-shirt
contests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he drove from Boston to New York. He knew no one. He
thumbed through the Yellow Pages to ``Bands &AMP; Orchestras'' and
began dialing numbers. Some places hung up on him. Others invited
him in for a tryout. One contractor asked him if he was free
Saturday. He was free indefinitely. ``Put yourself down,'' the man
told him. ``You've got two weddings.'' He picked up a third later
the same week. Within a year, he was subbing in Broadway plays. He
felt good about his footloose choice of career.
</P>
<P>
   Ausfahl now regards himself as one of the car mechanics of the
music business, someone who can be relied on to do solid, reliable
work. ``The way my career turned out, I'm not George Benson,'' he
said. ``I'm not a star. But I can really play.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never recorded his own album, though he has been on a few
bootleg records. In the past, he appeared at many familiar New York
nightclubs like CBGB and the Bitter End, but he has forsaken that
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally not lucrative,'' he said. ``They think you should
work for a piece of the door because of the exposure and then their
guy counts the door and you never seem to get what you should.
You're better off staying in your basement.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``At Christmas time, company parties were insane
years ago. No more. I used to do a lot of industrial jobs _ IBM
sales conferences and stuff. They've all cut back.'' He performed
at a fair number of debutante balls, but they have dried up, too.
``The ones I do,'' he said, ``instead of a parade of girls, I see
six.'' Another nearly defunct source of steady work is songwriter
demos. These days they tend to be done on a computer in a home
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Work used to flow worldwide. ``Once I was playing a party north
of London,'' he recalled, ``and the bass player nudged me and
pointed out that there was the queen.'' Nowadays, he travels very
little.
</P>
<P>
   He considers himself hard-boiled about social trends, but he has
made adjustments. He had done some music teaching, but doesn't much
care for it. He took classical guitar lessons and has been picking
up more classical and jazz gigs at restaurants and parties.
``Instead of working with bands, I find myself playing solo
classical,'' he said. ``The trouble is, when you play solo dates,
you're living wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Within reason, he'll take whatever comes along. He has a steady
Friday night gig at a university club, where he plays swing and
dance music and also sings. Once he played a divorce. A man was so
elated when his divorce papers were signed that he threw a party.
In exchange for a free checkup, he recorded a song written by his
dentist to be entered in a contest to anoint a state song for New
Jersey. (It lost.)
</P>
<P>
   He did a funeral in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. In her will, a woman
specified that a Dixieland band was to play at her final
appearance. Ausfahl was among the musicians hired to fulfill her
wish. As the coffin was carried out of the church, they struck up
some slower Dixieland numbers like ``Just a Closer Walk With
Thee.'' A weeping woman came up to Ausfahl and sobbed, ``Mother
would have loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday parties pay about $200 (weekdays are about $170), and
if he leads the band, it's $100 more. There is a $10 bonus if he
lugs along his own amplifier, which he always does. When he plays
solo guitar in a restaurant, he has trouble getting more than $125.
A jazz club pays him no more than $50 to $75. In these days of
depleted jobs, fees can get insulting. Not long ago, Ausfahl
rebuffed an offer to play jazz in a prison in Albany for $80.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it hard to comprehend why more people do not insist on
live music. ``To me the difference between a record and live music
is night and day,'' he said. ``When you play in a band and it all
works right, it's like floating on a cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   The splendiferous Bedens Brook Club lies at the end of a curving
road in Skillman, N.J., on the outskirts of Princeton. On a recent
Thursday evening, the Princeton class of 1953 had gathered for a
reunion dinner and dance. Don Anderson, a grizzled, 67-year-old
band leader and piano player, had hired Ausfahl and three others to
provide the evening's entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The elder classmates moved peristaltically across the polished
floor, most of the men in their Princeton orange sport jackets. The
band members were in black tie. The bass player, Michael Battiston,
said, ``I feel like a piece of dirt in a glass of orange juice.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spelled out his plan for the evening: ``We'll play some
stuff here. If nothing happens, we may assault them.'' ``Assault''
meant they would stroll from table to table and play.
</P>
<P>
   As the cocktail chatter proceeded, the band stayed with
background music, beginning with two Princeton songs. A woman
strutted over and asked Anderson to tone it down, it was hard to
talk over the music. ``Ah, they love us,'' Ausfahl said.
</P>
<P>
   He gazed at the crowd. ``We're talking people in their late
60s,'' he said. ``This seems to be what I get. I don't get the
young groups anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On they played: ``East of the Sun,'' ``Anna,'' ``Blue Moon.''
Anderson sang, ``New York, New York,'' sounding not even like the
treasurer of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Ausfahl did a solo and a woman stopped by to coo: ``He can just
do that all night long. I'm going to take someone like you home
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson quickly handed her a business card. ``I don't want to
be pushy,'' he said, ``but this is what we have to do.'' When she
had gone, he mentioned, ``One year, in 1986, I grossed $400,000.
Now I can do maybe a tenth of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson strapped on his accordion and announced that they were
going to stroll.
</P>
<P>
   Ausfahl looked stricken. He abhors strolling. He is not much for
repartee with the audience. When you stroll, people get up to sing
_ often in unknown keys _ and won't sit down. One table requests a
popular song like ``Memory'' and then all the other tables request
it. You wind up playing it 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was the same Princeton standard that everyone wanted:
``Going Back to Nassau Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   After dinner had been ingested, the band got heavy into dance
songs. The alchemy was just right, and they were clicking. The
reunion-goers rose from their chairs. Good drink had oiled
reluctant limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the evening waned, the floor was seething with dancers.
The musicians had smiles on their faces. By no means was Jeff
Ausfahl wallpaper tonight. He was making music.

FIRE OFFICIALS SEEK CAUSE OF FATAL BLAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fire marshals spent Sunday slowly searching what was
left of a row of Brooklyn buildings in search of definitive clues
to what caused a five-alarm blaze that killed a fire lieutenant and
left a fire captain severely burned and clinging to life, fire
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The injured captain, Scott LaPiedra, 40, of Staten Island, was
in critical condition Sunday night at Jacobi Medical Center in the
Bronx with second- and third-degree burns over more than 70 percent
of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife, Addie, was just asking people to pray for him
today,'' said Deputy Fire Commissioner Michael Regan. ``He's as
strong as an ox.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said scores of firefighters streamed through
Jacobi Medical Center Sunday as LaPiedra's family held vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in the department are praying for him,'' said Elbert
Washington, a Fire Department spokesman. ``There's an extreme
danger of infection. It's a matter of time. We're hoping for
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators picked through the charred remains of the
three-story, wood and brick city-owned apartment building at 2530
Atlantic Ave. in East New York, which burst into flames Friday
night. No occupants of the building were hurt, but the blaze spread
to three adjacent buildings and took more than 220 firefighters
more than four hours to bring under control.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they
suspect the fire started in a mattress in the apartment building
about 8:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington said Sunday that fire marshals had not announced
a definitive cause of the blaze and that the scope of the damage
was complicating the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had three buildings that were destroyed,'' he said.
``Given the number of buildings that were involved, combined with
the gathering of physical evidence, it's not unusual for it to take
this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said funeral services would be held Wednesday for
Lt. James Blackmore, 48, who died of a heart attack in the fire. In
addition to LaPiedra, five other firefighters injured in the blaze
remained hospitalized with second- and third-degree burns and other
injuries Sunday, fire officials said. None of their injuries was
considered life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmore, LaPiedra and the five other firefighters were injured
when they rushed onto the second floor of the burning apartment
building after a woman told them her elderly mother was trapped
there. As the firefighters searched for the missing woman, the
second floor collapsed, dropping them into a raging fire on the
first floor.
</P>
<P>
   Other firefighters dragged the injured men from the building.
The missing woman, it was later discovered, had already escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The wake for Blackmore will be held Monday and Tuesday at the
McCourt &AMP; Trudden Funeral Home at 385 Main St. in Farmingdale, N.Y.
His funeral will be held on Wednesday at 11 a.m. at St. Kilian
Roman Catholic Church at 485 Conklin St. in Farmingdale.

METS SEEM OUT OF IT IN FENWAY SLEEPWALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On Sunday night, the New York Mets looked like a team
in a trance or a team anxious to return home after an 11-game road
trip or a team that could not see very clearly because the
persistent rain pelted 25 pairs of eyes. Actually, the Mets looked
like all of the above and worse while tumbling to the Boston Red
Sox 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the wrong night for the resurgent Mets to be featured
nationally on ESPN since Masato Yoshii lasted only five innings and
Steve Avery _ remember him? _ pitched his best game for Boston
against a lineup that was still without the injured Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   While Yoshii was abysmal mostly during a four-run third, New
York's hitters were dismal all evening against a pitcher who
entered the contest with a 6.41 earned run average. Who would have
expected the Mets to pulverize Pedro Martinez, the Cy Young award
winner in the National League last season, for four homers Friday
night and be mesmerized by Avery, who has three pinch-running
appearances listed as achievements for 1998?
</P>
<P>
   But Avery won his third straight decision by baffling the Mets
with off-speed pitches and halting them on three hits in seven
innings as the Red Sox grabbed the final game of a three-game
interleague series. The Mets finished 7-4 on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii was pummeled as the Red Sox scored four runs with two
outs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis singled off the Green Monster in left, stole second
and scored when Reggie Jefferson rapped a 2-2 single to center.
After Nomar Garciaparra doubled on a 1-2 pitch and Mo Vaughn walked
to cram the bases, Troy O'Leary dribbled the third straight
two-strike pitch past a diving Carlos Baerga and into center to
score two more runs. John Valentin ended the two-strike streak by
blooping a 2-0 pitch into shallow right that doubled in Vaughn and
made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's homer in the fifth, his 18th, was the last run off
Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   After the early onslought, the Mets had a chance to get back
into it when Brian McRae started the fourth by hammering a 400-foot
triple to center. But McRae, whose gyrations helped Tim Wakefield
balk in the only run in a 1-0 victory on Saturday, did not seem as
anxious to score on Sunday night. He did not try to come in on
Edgardo Alfonzo's smash to first, which caromed off Vaughn's glove
and rolled away from him. Bernard Gilkey's flyball reached medium
right, but McRae stopped running about halfway down the line. The
inning ended abruptly as John Olerud struck out and Scott Hatteberg
threw to second to catch Gilkey by 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, McRae and the Mets never scored.

GIRL, 14, IS KILLED AFTER MAN HANDLES GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 14-year-old girl was shot and killed at a friend's
apartment in Brooklyn early Sunday when a pistol being handled by
an adult discharged, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believed that the shooting was an
accident and that the man, who was being sought for questioning,
panicked and fled.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Selena Slade, a resident of Bushwick, Brooklyn, was
listening to music in a friend's apartment at 1145 Lenox Rd. in
Brownsville just after midnight when she was shot in the chest by a
man who had started handling a pistol, said Officer Leslie Cardona,
a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was a friend of the woman who rented the apartment,
fled immediately, the police said. Miss Slade was pronounced dead
at the scene, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like an accident right now,'' said a police
investigator who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The guy
took off. He may have panicked.''
</P>
<P>
   A .32-caliber handgun was found in the apartment, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the 67th Precinct were still trying to find the
man and talk to him Sunday night. The police identified him only as
41 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Miss Slade's apartment in the Bushwick Houses, a project
just off Flushing Avenue, friends and neighbors wondered about the
senselessness of her death. ``My cousin was a growing girl who was
trying to learn life,'' one relative said. ``I can't believe she's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   At the apartment where Miss Slade was shot, in a well-kept
building called the Lenox Court, a radio was playing inside, but no
one would come to the door to discuss the shooting.

MAYOR TO TAKE AIM AT CITY COUNCIL PORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nestled among the mammoth numbers in the budget
passed by the City Council last week are page after page of small
ones: $500 to the Actors Company Theater, $3,000 to the Brooklyn
Puerto Rican Day Parade, $3,125 to the Shore Garden Club.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least there were.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says these treasured bits of pork _
``member items,'' as they're known _ will be his first stop as he
slices the Council's budget in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   Member items have long been a way for the Council leaders to
reward favored members and punish troublesome ones. Each of the
council's 44 Democrats was allowed to dole out at least $80,000 to
groups, while the 7 Republicans learned Friday that they had been
cut back to $50,000. The system makes most members happy, so few
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani is no slave to back-room tradition, and the member
items are about to vanish, and at the same time receive special
scrutiny. By Wednesday, the Mayor plans to announce his vetoes of
lines in the Council's budget, which he says is out of balance by
close to $251 million. A top aide said Sunday that Giuliani planned
to veto ``the vast majority'' of the member items.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what member items are,'' Giuliani said witheringly at
a news conference on Saturday. `` `My favorite program. The little
community group that supports me.' A couple of relatives here, a
couple of friends there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Council members are filling out their wish lists, senior
and favored members get more than the $80,000 minimum. The mayor
said the budget included at least $16 million in member items.
Indeed, member items have become so synonymous with shameless pork
that Council documents have begun calling them ``Council
initiatives'' in an effort at euphemism that one member compared to
a drive to refer to the Council lounge as the Council Conference
Room.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor suggested with his comments on Saturday, members do
take their items very personally. A frenzy erupted in the
high-ceilinged Council hearing room when the budget packets were
passed out at lunchtime on Friday, as Council members holed up in
bay windows and side rooms to check to be sure all their items were
included. Aides bearing cellular phones and takeout food peeked
over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Victor Robles, D-Brooklyn, whipped out a yellow
highlighter. Councilwoman Julia Harrison, a D-Queens, made a list
and checked it twice on an envelope. And Councilwoman Una Clarke, a
D-Brooklyn, huddled with a calculator and an aide from the Council
Finance Division.
</P>
<P>
   Most members submit a list of groups and desired amounts, which
are then listed in the budget under the appropriate city agency.
Typical recipients include YMCA's, Little Leagues and PTA's. A few
senior members, though, are allowed to distribute the money
personally during the year. Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten,
D-Brooklyn, described the items in terms that made them sound like
personal favors. ``It's my youth and my seniors and some of my
large organizations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The member items have often been used to please most Council
members just before the budget vote, and to punish others out of
step with the leadership. In the past, for instance, items for
liberal and progressive Democrats were cut by the party's centrist
leaders. This year, Council leaders said that when a Republican's
member items were reduced, the money was spread around in the
punished member's district, so that the district gets the money but
the member cannot claim credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Herbert Berman, the Finance Committee chairman, told
the outraged Republicans just before the budget vote: ``Trust me
when I tell you that your district has the same amount of money
that it had last year. You've got to look around a bit. You'll find
it.''

EXPERT FUND-RAISER CHALLENGES CONGRESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than a year, Rep. Edolphus Towns, a 16-year
member of Congress from Brooklyn, has been certain he would face
some well-connected opposition in the Democratic primary this year.
His only uncertainty was who that opponent would be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Towns found out. Barry Ford, a 35-year-old lawyer
with the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &AMP; Hamilton, announced that
he would seek to unseat Towns in the Sept. 15 primary. Although
Ford is as much a political novice as Towns is an experienced
political maneuverer, his insurgent candidacy is nonetheless
receiving a great deal of attention among Brooklyn politicians and
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a race by a political newcomer against a 63-year-old,
eight-term incumbent would not generate much attention. But Ford,
who was educated at Harvard University and Harvard Law School, has
so far raised nearly $100,000 _ only slightly less than the
$120,000 raised by Towns. Furthermore, Ford is being encouraged by
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the chairman of the Brooklyn
Democratic Party, and the Ford campaign is expected to benefit from
whatever assistance the chairman can muster.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two years, Towns has been locked in a bitter
political war with Norman, his onetime confidant. In recent months
the Democratic chairman has vowed to find a candidate to run
against the congressman. Norman first courted the Rev. Al Sharpton
before turning to City Councilwoman Annette Robinson, both of whom
ultimately decided not to run against Towns.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, however, has eagerly dived into the race. He has been
adept not only at raising money _ he worked as a fund-raiser for
President Clinton's last campaign, as well as for the campaigns of
former Mayor David Dinkins, former Gov. Mario Cuomo and Ruth
Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president _ but also at
focusing his attacks on Towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Towns has not represented his district,'' Ford said. ``He
is not a presence or a leader in Washington. He is in the pocket of
special interests and he has missed 1,000 votes in the House of
Representatives in 16 years. That's one of every eight votes.
That's not representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's sharpest attacks have been on Towns' relationship with
the tobacco industry, suggesting that the congressman ``is one of
the top recipients of their money.'' Ford said Towns had ``always
voted the interests and concerns of the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Towns said he had long been prepared for a strong
challenge, but he dismissed Ford as a political aspirant who has
not demonstrated much community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him at a town hall meeting, a community board
meeting or a tenants association meeting,'' the congressman said of
Ford. ``So, I don't have any idea of what his record of public
service is, and the voters don't either. This is one Ford this
Congressional District won't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addressing Ford's attacks, Towns said that Ford was inclined
toward exaggeration. ``Barry Ford claims that the tobacco industry
has given me $60,000 over a period of 10 years,'' the congressman
said. ``Legally, they could have given me $780,000. I've gotten
most of my money from the health-care community. If you're talking
about dollars to influence, then I would have to be called the
health-care congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his voting record, Towns said: ``I don't know who is doing
his research. I haven't missed nearly that many votes. My voting
record is in the 90 percent range.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year now, the feud between Towns and Norman has
occupied center stage in Brooklyn politics. For many years, the two
men operated as if they were political father and son. But in the
last two years, the two Democrats began sparring, first over
competing sets of delegates to the party's convention to select
judicial candidates, a race that Norman won.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after supporting Sharpton's mayoral campaign in the
Democratic primary, Towns endorsed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the
general election, a move that Norman called a final straw and an
act of party betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   While, in a recent interview, Ford said he was being supported
by the Brooklyn Democratic chairman, Norman was far more delicate
in describing the relationship. ``We are in communication with
Ford,'' Norman said, perhaps reflecting the difficulty within the
party's executive ranks in officially opposing an eight-term
incumbent. ``We are not supporting Ed Towns. Things evolve in life,
and there could be an official endorsement of Barry Ford.''

FOR A PROSECUTOR, DUTY CALLS BUT CONVICTION SHOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it came on Saturday, New York state's first
death-penalty verdict in decades showed that capital punishment
remains a tangled political issue long after its reinstatement in
New York and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney whose office
prosecuted the case, has staked out an unusual position that is
making him a symbol of the enduring potency of the debate over the
ultimate penalty.
</P>
<P>
   As district attorney, Hynes has sought death sentences in five
cases, far more than any other prosecutor in the state, winning him
praise from death-penalty proponents as a prosecutor who is willing
to make the threat of execution real.
</P>
<P>
   But as a candidate for governor in the crowded Democratic field,
Hynes is startling audiences across the state with passionate
criticism of the death penalty. Hynes is the only Democratic
candidate who persistently brings up the issue and promises if
elected to work to repeal the death-penalty law, whose passage was
a central theme of Gov. George Pataki's campaign four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As DA I've had the responsibility to apply the law,'' Hynes
said in a interview just after the verdict was announced. ``As a
leader and as someone running for governor, my responsibility is to
tell you the law is a sham.'' He said he had been expressing that
opinion for years before the law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1995, critics
have said Hynes has an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too position. Some
of them trace his position to a desire to win votes in the
hurly-burly of Brooklyn politics, a borough that includes the
liberal bastions of Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, the
politically conservative Orthodox Jewish enclaves and the
politically crucial black and Hispanic neighborhoods, where the
death penalty can be a volatile issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some death-penalty opponents say Hynes' position shows that
life-and-death decisions are being made in a political context.
``It illustrates the political nature of the death penalty, in that
there are people who oppose the death penalty but who feel for
political reasons they will, quote, carry out the law,'' said
Ronald Tabak, president of New York Lawyers Against the Death
Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers say Hynes' unlikely role in pushing capital
cases may actually represent a wily attempt to defeat
state-sanctioned execution. Under this theory _ some call it an
``in your face'' strategy _ he is trying to underscore the flaws of
capital punishment by forcing people to confront real
life-and-death cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Hynes denied that he had pursued the death
penalty for political reasons. But he acknowledged the obvious
distress of the jurors after the death sentence was announced for
Darrel Harris, a former jail guard once cited for heroism who was
convicted of a triple homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is an attempt by Hynes to have it both
ways'' on the death penalty, said Kenneth Fisher, a Democratic city
councilman from Brooklyn who has often worked with Hynes but is not
supporting him for governor. ``I think he is genuinely opposed to
it. And his aggressive use of it is a way to call attention to the
fact that he thinks the death penalty is offensive and obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Hynes' motives, his role as a prosecutor who seeks the
death penalty while remaining personally opposed to it has been
part of a winning political formula in Brooklyn. In 1997, during
his third successful campaign to be prosecutor of New York City's
most populous borough, he won with not only the Democratic and
Liberal Party designations but with the Republican nomination as
well.
</P>
<P>
   For district attorneys, who must stand for election even if they
do not have larger political ambitions, the state's reinstatement
of the death penalty in 1995 created a political minefield.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the city's district attorneys has steered through it
exceedingly carefully. Their views range from outright support for
the death penalty, expressed by District Attorney William Murphy of
Staten Island, to cautious opposition, expressed by District
Attorney Robert Johnson of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawyers have concluded that the Manhattan district
attorney, Robert Morgenthau, is shrewdly sabotaging the law.
Morgenthau, a longtime death-penalty opponent, has said he is
evaluating each case on its merits. But he has yet to ask for the
penalty after considering the question in a dozen cases. The Queens
district attorney, Richard Brown, has said he is opposed to the
death penalty but has sought it in at least two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson incurred the wrath of Pataki when he issued a statement
shortly after the passage of the law, saying, ``It is my present
intention not to utilize the death-penalty provisions of the
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, that stance proved popular; Johnson was
overwhelmingly re-elected later that year. But in 1996, Pataki
removed Johnson from a case involving the killing of a police
officer and appointed state Attorney General Dennis Vacco; the case
never went to trial because the defendant committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's action was approved in 1997 by the state's
highest court. In what was widely understood to be a threat to
prosecutors across the state, the governor said after that court
decision, ``I will not allow certain areas of the state to become
death-penalty-free zones.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, a death-penalty opponent who is executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Saturday's
verdict opened the door to a new era of executions in New York
state. Hynes, as the prosecutor who has been most active in seeking
death sentences, bears some responsibility for that no matter what
his own views are, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect his argument that you have to uphold the law. On the
other hand, there are other district attorneys who have interpreted
the law in a different way,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   For any prosecutor with statewide ambitions, Pataki's victory in
his battle with Johnson made the politics of death-penalty choices
clear: Seek the death penalty or risk being tarred as an
obstructionist.
</P>
<P>
   An obstructionist posture might win support from staunch
death-penalty opponents. But it was also likely to galvanize
proponents and make them active political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said his opposition to the death penalty is decades old
and is based not on political factors but pragmatic ones. In
response to a question, he said the morality of the death penalty
is ``questionable.'' But his objection stems from a belief that
execution does nothing to protect the public or prevent crime and,
in essence, gives venal criminals an easy way out compared with
life in prison without parole, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's punishment,'' Hynes said. ``The public
was sold a bill of goods.'' Nevertheless, he said, his obligation
as Brooklyn's chief law-enforcement officer required him to
evaluate each case. Hynes' decision to seek death sentences in five
cases came after he reviewed the 27 cases in which defendants were
subject to possible execution.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes has always presented himself as a politician who is
disgusted by the pandering of other politicians. He said his
remarks against the death penalty while he pursues it in court are
consistent with a frankness that he believes voters want.
</P>
<P>
   However well his approach has worked in Brooklyn, for years his
apparent frustration at being unable to move beyond the district
attorney's office has been a constant of New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   He took office after becoming a political celebrity in the 1970s
and '80s. He was a special prosecutor in cases of nursing-home
fraud and political corruption. He had well-placed political
friends and was once New York City fire commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   As special prosecutor in the 1986 Howard Beach racial killing
cases, he achieved widespread fame, with books written about him
and a television movie in which he was played by Daniel Travanti.
</P>
<P>
   His ambitions have long been the subject of speculation. He was
often mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor or governor and
ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general twice, in 1978 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have suggested that his stance on the death penalty was
intended to try to ensure that his longtime opposition would not
become a roadblock to higher office.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he conceded that at 63, he is probably running
his last campaign for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Harris' case, Hynes said, simply showed the legal
system at work. ``Everyone did their job,'' he said, ``including
what we had to do, which is follow the law.''

`THE LION KING' WINS BEST-MUSICAL AND 5 OTHER TONYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Lion King,'' a daring mix of experimental
techniques with a familiar story that was a critical success and a
smashing financial one for Walt Disney Co., won the Tony Award for
best musical Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The musical took six Tonys, including one for its director,
Julie Taymor. The chief competition for ``Lion King'' was
``Ragtime,'' a lavish musical based on E.L. Doctorow's celebrated
novel, which won four awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art,'' a three-character comedy about Parisian men whose
disagreement over a Minimalist painting jostles loose half-buried
fissures in their friendship, won the Tony Award for best play at
the ceremony at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which was written in French by Yasmina Reza, a French
citizen of Iranian descent, and translated for the stage in London
by Christopher Hampton, had not been favored to win the award.
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' about mother-daughter cruelty in
rural Ireland, was considered the evening's likely winner. But the
voters decided to go with this streamlined audience pleaser over
Martin McDonagh's scalding comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout Theater Company also had a big night, winning
awards for best revival of a play, for Arthur Miller's ``View From
the Bridge,'' and best revival of a musical, for the seedy,
atmospheric restaging of ``Cabaret'' that has become one of the
hottest tickets in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret,'' which is being staged in a Times Square nightclub
remodeled to look like a Weimar cabaret, also won awards for
Natasha Richardson's lead performance as the singer Sally Bowles,
for Alan Cumming's lead performance as the M.C. at the play's Kit
Kat Klub, and for Ron Rifkin's featured performance as a Jewish
shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   And Anthony LaPaglia won best actor in a play as the doomed
dockworker in ``A View From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Audra McDonald won for best featured actress in a musical for
playing a struggling wife and mother in ``Ragtime.'' It was her
third Tony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time was the scariest,'' Ms. McDonald said. Her two
previous awards are in her sister's closet, she said, but she
thought she'd send this one to her mother in California.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than half a century for the Tonys to present its
first directing award to a woman. It took five minutes to present
the second one.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Hynes, whose Druid Theater first staged McDonagh's work,
won the award by bringing the dark comedy to Broadway. And then Ms.
Taymor, the experimental director whose choice by Disney to bring
``The Lion King'' to the stage was once seen as a surprising risk,
took the award for best director of a musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud to join in this long line of award-winning
women directors,'' Ms. Taymor said. ``This is just spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52nd annual Tony Awards capped the most successful season in
Broadway history, with record attendance of more than 11 million
and box-office grosses in excess of $550 million, and it was among
the most competitive Tony ceremony in many years with strong
contests in virtually every category. For the second year, Rosie
O'Donnell was host.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York, the town Godzilla destroyed,'' Ms. O'Donnell said.
``Why? He couldn't get tickets to `Cabaret.' And 42nd Street is
back. Not the musical, the entire street. It's family-ized. It
really is. Last night, I saw four hookers dressed as Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway season's two biggest musical blockbusters split the
early awards Sunday night, with ``The Lion King'' also winning for
its choreography and technical achievements and ``Ragtime'' taking
the writing and composition honors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Lion King,'' a spectacle including puppets and fantastic
lighting and scenic effects, also won awards for Garth Fagan's
choreography and for its lighting and costume design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime,'' a more traditional book musical set in turbulent,
turn-of-the-century New York, won Tonys for best original score for
Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, for William David Brohn's
orchestrations and for Terrence McNally's book.
</P>
<P>
   McNally, whose newest play, ``Corpus Christi,'' was a subject of
controversy last month when a local theater company, the Manhattan
Theater Club, temporarily canceled plans to stage it after
receiving death threats, won the award for best book of a musical
for ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Theater Club's announcement drew ire from
playwrights and other theater professionals and the company
reinstated the play, which mixes themes of Christianity and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the theater community, which came together
when I was in trouble in a time of oppression,'' McNally said in
accepting his award. ``You spoke up and came together overnight.
Your voices were heard and we won and I am very grateful for that.
Without you, I wouldn't be standing up here, either, and eventually
none of us would. So this is for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Antoinette Perry Awards _ popularly known as Tonys _
were presented by the American Theater Wing in 1947 in the grand
ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the actress, director and producer who died in 1946
after having been one of the leaders of the wing, a theatrical
service organization, the awards have established themselves as the
most important in American commercial theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Administration Committee, including most of the key
players on Broadway and in national touring productions, oversees
the awards and determines who is eligible to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
   A Tony Nominating Committee, which has 19 members, announced
this year's roster of nominees on May 4, beginning five weeks of
cocktail parties, awards ceremonies and behind-the-scenes jostling.
In the end, some 782 theater professionals and journalists were
eligible to cast ballots in 21 categories for Sunday night's
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Not telecast nationally until 1967 (when the original production
of ``Cabaret'' won best musical), the Tonys are now a
co-presentation of the wing and the League of American Theaters and
Producers. The awards had bounced from Broadway theater to theater
in recent years, with dwindling television audiences, until they
were moved to Radio City last year and Ms. O'Donnell was installed
as host.
</P>
<P>
   The instant success of the new format and the new host _ ratings
rose 35 percent over 1996 _ silenced those who had been
uncomfortable with the Tonys being held in a non-Broadway house and
presided over by a television talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ms. O'Donnell solidified her position with the Tonys,
serving as one of the program's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Broadway veterans were among the presenters Sunday
night, including Tommy Tune, Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth, the
producers also included numerous film and television personalities
who will appear or have appeared in recent shows, such as Helen
Hunt, Alec Baldwin and Marisa Tomei.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour awards ceremony was split into two programs.
During the first hour, which was broadcast on PBS by WNET/Channel
13 in New York City, all of the technical and behind-the-scenes
awards were presented, including the directing awards. This left
the subsequent two-hour CBS broadcast to distribute the awards for
best play, best musical, best revivals and all of the acting
awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Center Theater Company won the annual award given to
a regional theater troupe.

 (With BULLS-JAZZ) 
JAZZ LOOK TIMID AND STUNNED  (bb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Utah Jazz has players with crew cuts and Scout
badges, good manners and accounting degrees. So polite, so
upstanding. And yet so unequipped to match the snarling nature of a
physical team that would just as easily kick sand in the face of
the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls were the aggressors, while the Jazz played the
part of a team from the West typically overwhelmed by a hardened
East team that hit and hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the Jazz went whimpering away from the United
Center after being humiliated 96-54 in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz was docile as it left with a trail of 26 turnovers. It
was out-rebounded, 50-38.
</P>
<P>
   The head bullies were Scottie Pippen, Toni Kukoc and Dennis
Rodman. They were part of a defensive and offensive effort by the
Bulls that was so aggressive, the Jazz players were punch drunk by
the end of the first half. The Jazz appeared too stunned and too
timid to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of countering with toughness, the Jazz settled for
passive jumpers, rushed its plays and fell right into the hands of
a Bulls team that was driving to the basket and pressuring the
ball. The combo resulted in a runaway game that began in the second
quarter. In a horrible span of the period, the Jazz turned the ball
over nine times and fell behind by 18 points before the half.
</P>
<P>
   To build that gaudy lead, Pippen became omnipresent as he cut
off every passing lane and flew into the face of any guard who
dared to drive to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Karl Malone from countering to keep his team close,
Rodman began irritating what had been a hot Malone.
</P>
<P>
   He began sticking Malone in the back, and needling him into
frustration. After Malone hit his first six shots, the bulk of
which were over Luc Longley, Rodman came and turned things around.
</P>
<P>
   Malone took just one more shot in the first half, and was much
more ineffective the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc also factored into the Bulls' ambush. He continually found
his way to the loose balls, beating players bigger and bulkier in
wrestling away rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was not as if the Jazz players did not realize they faced a
team capable of outmuscling them. The Jazz entered this game in
search of some aggression after a pedestrian effort in Game 2, when
it was outrebounded on the offensive boards 18-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like we were wearing tuxedos,'' Sloan said. ``We
didn't want to touch anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was irate in Game 2. He was watching the Bulls be the
aggressors, seeing them drive for baskets and barge in when they
missed a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr was a perfect example. He missed his 3-pointer, but
bolted ahead of John Stockton and underneath Malone to pull away
the rebound. Kerr then whipped a pass to Jordan, who completed a
3-point play that gave the Bulls a lead they would never relinquish
with 47 seconds left in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching the films, it seemed like everyone was standing
around,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sloan's pleas were in vain. The Jazz Sunday night continued
to play like a team born from the Western Conference stereotype:
all talent, no backbone.
</P>
<P>
   The feistiness belonged to the Bulls. Pippen did not get credit
for every steal, or every forced turnover, but the fact that he was
able to roam the court helped him disrupt everything in his path.
He was there to shut down Stockton and make him look like a shell
of himself with repeated turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc was there to pick up the remnants of Pippen's work by
grabbing three first-half steals from the flustered and frustrated
Jazz. By the end of the first half, the Jazz had turned the ball
over 12 times, including 9 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen got credit for one steal and one blocked shot. Kukoc came
up with five rebounds to go with his steals.
</P>
<P>
   As aggressive as the duo was on defense, it was equally
assertive on offense. Pippen and Kukoc were going to make the Jazz
work.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen repeatedly drove on Bryon Russell, while Kukoc worked his
way around Greg Foster inside the paint.
</P>
<P>
   They were making a living getting under the skin of the Jazz.
This kind of effort was expected of Pippen. He is so diverse, his
normal play affects about three or four categories by the end of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc's consistency has been questioned. In Game 2, he came out
with a sense of urgency to get himself into the game. He scored 13
first-half points, and helped take some of the burden off of
Michael Jordan. In the second half, though, he did not score
because he did not get aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped moving,'' Kukoc said. ``I started settling for the
outside jumpers. I stopped working my way inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls barged inside like party-crashers Sunday night. And
falling into the stereotypical mold of a team out of the West, the
Jazz simply stepped aside all too politely.

DODGERS HOLD OFF MARINERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Los Angeles Dodgers were three outs from going
home with a smile, but since when is anything that easy?
</P>
<P>
   After eight solid innings from Darren Dreifort on Sunday,
manager Bill Russell needed three relievers to get through the
ninth inning of a 7-4 interleague victory over the Seattle Mariners
in front of 41,514 at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were hoping to think only about the home runs by
Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros or the three RBI by Paul Konerko.
They took two of three against the Mariners and had a good chance
to make up some ground in the National League West by playing three
games this week against the lowly Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   But as the plane was warming up so was the bullpen. And suddenly
the Dodgers' six-run lead started to shrink. Ken Griffey Jr. hit a
two-run homer off Mark Guthrie, who then gave up a single and a
walk. Scott Radinsky was no better, facing two batters, walking one
and allowing a hit to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui, pinch hitting for the first time this season, stood
at the plate representing the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ninth inning is always exciting,'' deadpanned Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   That Osuna struck out Segui on a 2-2 fastball to end the game is
only part of the story. If Osuna hadn't struggled all season,
Guthrie and Radinsky would never have been in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for a hot hand right now,'' Russell said.
``Maybe now is the time for Osuna to step into that role.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is no longer Radinsky, who took over the closer
role when Osuna faltered. He didn't get a blown save the way he did
twice at home against Cincinnati, but he has allowed 12 of the last
20 batters he's faced to reach base (nine hits, three walks).
</P>
<P>
   But Russell knows that Osuna, like Radinsky, is a one-pitch
fastball pitcher. Osuna has more velocity, Radinsky more movement.
Neither has been consistent and hitters have adjusted. Radinsky had
10 saves in his first 11 attempts, but just one in his past four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be that guy,'' said Osuna, who also saved Saturday's
game. ``There were times when I lost my confidence, but I have
gained it back.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence had been shattered early this year when Osuna
came out of spring training with a new three-year contract but
without control. He left the team for several days in early May
when his father became ill in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With 62 down, and 100 games to play, the Dodgers (31-31) need
him to step up.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (4-5) certainly has done his share, winning for the
fourth time in five starts. He struck out Griffey three times, the
first time that has happened this year. Dreifort allowed nine hits
but was helped by two of the Dodgers' three double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Dodgers refused to trade Dreifort to the
Mariners as part of the Randy Johnson deal. Sunday he showed why he
might be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a young arm like that you want to hold on to
him,'' Russell said. ``He gave us great effort today and you know
he is going to be around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was given the lead on a first-inning homer by Sheffield
and a fourth-inning blast by Karros, both off Mariners starter
Jamie Moyer (3-6).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers appeared to blow open the game in the sixth when six
consecutive batters reached base against Moyer and five scored.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko, who had four RBI on Saturday, highlighted the inning
with a bases-clearing double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm Juan Gonzalez now,'' said Konerko, referring
to the major-league RBI leader. ``I knew with an off-speed guy like
Moyer I had no chance to pull the ball. That is the best way to hit
anyway. Things seem to finally be falling into place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers never scored again, but that didn't seem to be a
problem _ until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dreifort cruised, Guthrie had been up three times
previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tough situation to be in,'' said Dreifort, who
opened the season in the bullpen. ``If you get loose that much and
don't get in the game it's hard. If you get loose that much and you
don't pitch well, it's even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are quality guys. They know how to pitch.''

STATE SENATOR WITHDRAWS BID FOR U.S. HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Seabrook, a state senator from the Bronx who
had long planned to oppose Rep. Eliot Engel, a fellow Democrat,
said Sunday that he would not run for Congress this year but would
prepare for a congressional campaign in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook's decision was an abrupt departure from the position he
has taken for nearly a year. Indeed, as recently as last week,
Seabrook said he had firmly decided to run against Engel and had
met with a host of politicians, fund-raisers and strategists to put
together a campaign against the five-term congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Seabrook, 46, said he had decided
against running, because he had failed to raise enough money and
because he had not seen a significant increase in the number of
registered black voters in the 17th Congressional District, which
covers the northern Bronx and parts of Westchester County. Seabrook
is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it would take us more time than we expected to put our
campaign together,'' he said. Specifically, he said he had raised
only a third of the $300,000 he wanted to have on hand to challenge
the incumbent congressman. ``But I will continue to raise funds and
register voters so that in the next millennium we will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook had contended that the shifting demographics of the
district were creating a more receptive environment for his
candidacy against Engel, who is white. After the 1992
redistricting, the district's lines were redrawn to increase its
share of racial and ethnic minorities to nearly 70 percent: 38
percent black, 29 percent Hispanic, 29 percent white, 3 percent
Asian and 1 percent other.
</P>
<P>
   Both Seabrook and Engel said the district's black and Hispanic
populations have grown since then. Luther Blake, a demographic
consultant, calculates that about 75 percent of the district's
population consists of members of minorities, while Seabrook
contends that the figure is closer to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook's decision came just days before the beginning of the
petitioning period, when candidates have to declare and file papers
indicating which offices they seek. It also came after meetings
with Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic chairman,
who has made the protection of his party's incumbents from
insurgent challenges the cornerstone of his stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook acknowledged that he had spoken with Ramirez, but
declined to discuss details of their conversation. Ramirez could
not be reached by telephone at his home Sunday and did not return
calls to his office.
</P>
<P>
   Engel said in an interview Sunday: ``I am certainly delighted.
It's important for the Democratic Party to be united in a year
where we have important statewide races.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ramirez and the Bronx Democratic organization
averted what had been widely expected to be another turbulent
battle when Pedro Espada Jr., a former state senator who has been
in a heated feud with the party organization, announced that he
would not run for his former seat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Espada's decision, Seabrook's withdrawal from this year's
congressional race represents a major victory for Ramirez. With
Seabrook and Espada no longer candidates, the Bronx Democratic
organization will have little to no substantial opposition for its
incumbents.

EDITORIAL: GOP TRICKERY IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 8:
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform has been declared dead many times by
Newt Gingrich and his eager pallbearers, only to rise again with
more support. But with the House set to open its long-deferred
debate on overhauling campaign finance laws, the speaker has come
up with another strategy to squelch reform in the form of a
parliamentary rule to allow hundreds of amendments. This sneaky
attempt to sow legislative chaos and run out the clock is another
abuse of power by the speaker. But advocates can win by standing up
to the Georgia obstructionist.
</P>
<P>
   The death-by-amendment strategy was all but acknowledged on
Friday by the majority leader, Dick Armey, arch defender of
unlimited special-interest donations. He said Gingrich is
fulfilling his promise of an open debate. But this is a filibuster
in disguise, since Senate-style filibusters are illegal in the
House. Armey betrayed his true feelings when he said he wanted
campaign reform ``done, completed and out of my life by July 4th.''
In other words, he wants it buried and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's pattern of obstruction was first established last
fall. But a revolt by Republicans forced him to schedule a vote for
1998. When the time came to redeem that promise, Gingrich insulted
his colleagues by blocking consideration of the one bill that would
change the system, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays of
Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. Only when the
Shays-Meehan supporters gathered enough signatures on a petition to
bring the bill to the floor did Gingrich relent. The lesson is that
if Republicans and Democrats raise a cry of protest, Gingrich will
back down.
</P>
<P>
   With another election approaching and rivers of special-interest
money flowing into the system, voters are tired of politicians'
excuses. The Shays-Meehan bill would ban the unlimited donations to
political parties known as ``soft money'' and curb fund-raising for
campaign ads run by independent groups. This page has called
attention to another danger to the bill, which is that House
members will push alternatives that do little to change the system
and hope they get more votes than Shays-Meehan. Lawmakers are
beginning to understand, and the Shays-Meehan bill is within reach
of commanding a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Armey and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, will be in charge of
the trial-by-amendment scheme. Among their amendments are every
variety of poison-pill rider designed to repel Democratic votes.
Some of these measures might deserve to be considered on their
merits on another day. For now, their obvious purpose is to delay
Shays-Meehan and confuse the public.
</P>
<P>
   Under the glare of publicity, the tactics of Gingrich and his
colleagues will be seen for what they are, a brazen attempt to
undermine the public demand for an end to the influence-peddling
that passes for campaign finance in America. Supporters of change
are close to having the votes. The speaker's desperate trickery
shows that he knows it. Now is the time for all lawmakers to stand
up and demonstrate that Congress answers to the public, not to
moneyed interests and a devious speaker.
