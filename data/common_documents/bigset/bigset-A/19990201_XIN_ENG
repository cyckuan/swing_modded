<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Bombard Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes Sunday fired
HARM missiles at a radar unit in Mosul in northern Iraq while
patrolling the no-fly zone there, said a statement issued by the
Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a U.S. F-16 fighter jet fired the missiles
at the radar facility near Mosul, the biggest city in northern
Iraq, after being targeted by an Iraqi radar.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at 14:20 local time (1220 GMT). But the
statement did not mention how many missiles were fired or how much
damages were inflicted on the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two U.S warplanes, one AWACS plane, three tanker
aircraft, four transport planes and four commander planes took
off from Incirlik base between 11:30 and 13:30 local time (0930
and 1130 GMT) on Sunday on a patrol mission in the northern no-fly
zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bombardments of Iraqi sites in the no-fly zones have
resumed and become commonplace recently after four days of air
strikes against Iraq in mid December last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its western allies set up two no-fly
zones in northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to
protect the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south
from alleged Saddam's suppression.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of the allied forces stationed in
Incirlik as part of the Operation Northern Watch to patrol the
northern no-fly zone.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: NATO Force Cannot Save Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Of late, the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo was once again brought into the
limelight. From Brussels, seat of the NATO headquarters, to the
U.S. capital of Washington, political and military big shots
almost spoke in one voice: "Only force can save Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
NATO's Saturday authorization of the air strikes on Belgrade
means nothing but one more step forward by the U.S.-led military
alliance on the dangerous track, simply because the unilateral
decision runs counter the United Nations Charter and the norms of
international law.
</P>
<P>
Any military action against a sovereign country should first
get approval from the U.N. Security Council, a 15-member body
which enjoys unshirkable and irreplaceable authority in
maintaining world peace and security. In NATO's case, the move is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
NATO's decision was made on the basis of the controversial
massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak, south
Kosovo. However, the allegation does not hold water as the
alliance reaches the conclusion well before the substantial
kickoff of a full and objective investigation.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, NATO plays prosecutor, judge and executioner at the
same time as it moves to launch military strikes on the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, which is facing an uphill task to defend
its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this case, the move
is illogical. So, how can this judgement become fair and
impartial?
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the Serbian province's
population of 2 million, resorted to force for independence.
Western countries have since imposed one-sided pressure on
Belgrade, rather than making effective peaceful mediation to seek
a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The partial propaganda offensives have in fact not only
interfered in the internal affairs of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, but encouraged the armed provocation and independence
bid by terrorists and separatists in Kosovo, thus steadily
worsening the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Western nations, to a large extent, should be also
answered for the escalating tensions in the Yugoslav province. A
trouble maker cannot be a good policeman in the current world
order, which is not fair and just.
</P>
<P>
With the ultimatum from the West, war is looming large in the
Balkans, known as "the powder kit" in Europe. However, Washington
has been put into an awkward situation after its military action
in Iraq solved nothing. Therefore, it is high time for NATO to
learn some lessons from the U.S. failure and come to realize the
simple truth: military force cannot save Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Economist Delegation to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- In a new step to help warm up
bilateral relations, an Iranian economic delegation will start a
visit to Egypt on Monday, Abdel-Moneim Seoudi, the head of the
Federation of Egyptian Industries said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seoudi told reporters that he will hold talks with the members
of the Iranian delegation during their week-long visit, and will
seek ways of enhancing economic cooperation and investment between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation's upcoming visit to Egypt is "a positive
reaction" to the developments in the bilateral political
relations, Seoudi said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed its diplomatic relations with Cairo in 1979
after Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel, of which Iran is a
staunch opponent.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Mohammed Khatami, a moderate cleric, was elected
Iranian president in August 1997, both Iran and Egypt have
demonstrated their readiness to improve their relations and
exchanged visits by economic, cultural and parliamentary
delegations.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the Federation of Egyptian Industries visited
Iran last March to explore means of boosting bilateral industrial
and trade cooperation. Enidtem

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Congratulates Abdullah as Jordanian New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti cabinet Sunday
congratulated Abdullah Ibn Hussein as the new Crown Prince of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, in a statement after its weekly session, extended
good wishes to the crown prince and the brotherly Jordanian
people, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein last week removed his brother Hassan Bin
Talal as his successor and named his eldest son Abdullah as the
crown prince.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also expressed hope that the Jordanian-Kuwaiti ties will
be further promoted in the interests of both sides, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two Arab countries soured after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when Amman sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A rapprochement process began in May 1997 when Kuwait declared
it "likes to improve ties with all Arab countries except Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two sides exchanged a number of high-level
visits.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said earlier January that he has invited
his Jordanian counterpart Abdul Ilah Al-Khatib to visit Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"If the Jordanian foreign minister comes, everything will be
settled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabah's planned trip to Amman last week was postponed only
because of Hussein's sudden return to the U.S. for further cancer
treatment.

JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday the relationship between Israel
and Jordan will be stable both in the short term and in the long
term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting in
Jerusalem, Netanyahu confirmed he has ordered extra efforts to
strengthen ties with Jordan in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the cabinet meeting also said that
keeping a good relationship with Jordan is a pillar of Israel's
national policy.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that during a phone conversation with
Netanyahu last Friday, Jordanian Crown Prince Abdullah expressed
his willingness to continue King Hussein's peace policy with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hussein returned to the United States last week for a relapse
of cancer only a week after coming home. He replaced his brother
Hassan Bin Talal, who has been crown prince for 36 years,
with his eldest son Abdullah to be the successor of his throne.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat have congratulated the new crown prince and
expressed hopes for Hussein's recovery.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan signed a peace agreement in 1994. Since
then, Hussein has played an important role in the Middle East
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Turkey to Reconsider Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday reiterated Tehran's call on Turkey
to reconsider its cooperation with Israel, which is seen by Iran
as a threat to the region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Speaker of Turkish National
Assembly (parliament) Hikmet Cetin, Rafsanjani said Turkey's
relations with Israel, especially in the security and military
fields, will have negative impacts on the stability and security
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Considering the Turkish people's strong belief in Islam, such
a great Muslim country as Turkey is expected to remain on the side
of the world of Islam, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern about the intervention of foreign
countries in the region and its subsequent negative impacts on
the stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Regional states should be alert against foreign plots in the
region, especially those of the United States and Israel, said
Rafsanjani, who is currently chairman of the State Expediency
Council, an advisory body to the Iranian supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for resumption of trilateral talks
among Iran, Turkey and Syria on regional issues, the Iraqi crisis
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Cetin said in reply that Turkey believes in the preservation of
Iraq's territorial integrity and is opposed to intervention in
the domestic affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign intervention has not weakened the position of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, nor will it be able to do so in future,
rather it has strengthened his position, he added.
</P>
<P>
Extending thanks to Iran for its proposal to resume trilateral
talks on Iraqi crisis, the Turkish official voiced Ankara's
readiness to participate in such talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkey attaches high significance to maintaining and promoting
relations with Iran and will not allow any dissident groups to get
involved in anti-Iran activities on its soil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cetin also called for expansion of technical and economic
relations between Iran and Turkey along with their political ties.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish speaker, who arrived here on Friday for a four-day
visit, also met Iranian First Vice President Hassan Habibi on
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed
Associate Administrator of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), Zephirin Diabre, left here Sunday for Cotonou, Benin,
after concluding a three-day working visit to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Diabre, a Burkinabe, is the first African to hold the position
of UNDP Associate Administrator. He was named recently and assumed
his functions at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Diabre told local press before his departure for Cotonou that
the development projects being undertaken jointly by UNDP and the
Ethiopian government is "fruitful".
</P>
<P>
He noted that UNDP has earmarked over 120 million U.S. Dollars
to support the on-going development efforts in Ethiopia for the
next five years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Proposes to Add "Human Face" to Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 31 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged world business leaders here
Saturday to give a human face to the global market by initiating a
global compact of shared values and principles.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is a fact of life. But I believe we have
underestimated its fragility," the U.N. chief said in a speech
given at a plenary session of the ongoing annual meeting of the
World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
In order to restore social harmony and political stability
following the Great Depression which began in 1929, Annan
recalled, the industrialized countries adopted social safety nets
and other measures designed to limit economic volatility and
compensate the victims of market failures.
</P>
<P>
"The consensus made possible successive moves towards
liberalization which brought about the long post-war period of
economic expansion," he told the 2,000 participants at the WEF
annual meeting at which the participants focused their discussions
on the theme of "Responsible Globalization."
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge today is to devise a similar compact on the
global scale, to underpin the new global economy," Annan said. "If
we succeed in that, we would lay the foundations for an age of
global prosperity, comparable to that enjoyed by the
industrialized countries in the decades after World War Two."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Air Defense Sites Attacked Again By U.S. Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Sunday attacked some air defense sites in northern and southern
Iraq, said an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying 13
formations of enemy planes from Kuwaiti bases and 15 formations
from Saudi bases violated Iraqi airspace at 9:00 a.m. (0600 GMT)
and 15:15 p.m. (1215 GMT) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said these warplanes attacked air defense sites
in Thi-Qar and Missan provinces in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said earlier Sunday that U.S. and British
jets attacked a communications repeater station and a radio
relay facility in southern Iraq, citing their role in aircraft
command and control.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, eight formations of enemy planes violated
Iraqi airspace in the north, said the spokesman, adding they
launched a high-speed anti-radiation missile, called HARM, at a
radar system north of Mosul.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq were imposed by
the U.S.-led western allies after the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south from Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, U.S. jets fired 17 missiles and bombs on Iraqi
defense sites in six incidents around the northern city of
Mosul. It was believed to be the largest number of confrontations
in a single day since Iraq began to challenge the jets patrolling
the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
After the four-day U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq in
mid-December, Iraq announced that it will not recognize the
no-fly zones as they were not authorized by the United Nations.

HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe People's Convention
(ZPC) Sunday expressed concern over the economic hardships in the
south African country.
</P>
<P>
ZPC spokesman Obey Mudzingwa said in a statement that there was
a need for the government to resolve the economic situation as a
matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
"Prices of basic commodities like mealie-meal, cooking oil and
sugar should be kept low in order to avoid starvation and social
strife," he said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in December, 1998, rose to a record level of
46.6 percent, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Mealie-Meal, the country's staple food, has been in short
supply in the past week, resulting in consumers' failing to get
maize-meal in most supermarkets and other retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
Mudzingwa said the recent hikes in educational and examination
fees for higher education would burden an already constrained
worker and should be reversed.

ADDIS ABABA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Vice-Minister
of Transport and Communications, Ayenew Bitewlign, said Sunday
that the century-old Ethio-Djibouti railways should be able to
meet the growing transportation needs especially now when Ethiopia
has re-routed its import- export trade to Port Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Bitewlign made the
remarks when he was opening here the 26th Regular Conference of
the Ethio-Djibouti Railway Company Administrative Council.
</P>
<P>
Bitewlign said measures should be taken to ensure the
implementation of the study made to revitalize the company.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts should be made to strengthen the company with
man-power and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister also called for the realization of the
financial pledge made by the European Union to promote the
services being rendered by the company.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that preparations are underway to undertake a
study on the installation of an additional railway line between
Ethiopia and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the company Ali Abdellah Gadid said at the
meeting that six locomotives have been overhauled with the fund
obtained from the French Development Aid Agency and five of them
have been put into service.

UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has decided to fire one U.N. employee and demote
another who were charged with document forgeries, U.N. officials

</P>
<P>
Their misconduct nearly derailed the reform program of the

The incident, with the involvement of an Iraqi man and a

offenses were not disclosed, the officials said.

A U.N. disciplinary committee recommended the punishment to
Annan, who accepted its advice late last week to fire the Iraqi

<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 31 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called on the international
community to make the right choices if the global markets and
multilateral trading system are to be maintained in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"We have to choose between a global market driven only by
calculations of short-term profit, and one which has a human
face," the U.N. chief said in a speech given at the ongoing annual
meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He also called on governments, corporations, NGOs and
international organizations to make the choice between a world
which condemns a quarter of the human race to starvation and
squalor, and one which offers everyone at least a chance of
prosperity in a healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
The other choice which the international community should make,
Annan said, is "between a selfish free-for-all in which we ignore
the fate of the losers and a future in which the strong and
successful accept their responsibilities, showing global vision
and leadership."
</P>
<P>
He reminded his audience that "the global markets and
multilateral trading system we have today did not come about by
accident." "They are the result of enlightened policy choices made
by governments since 1945," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure you will make the right choice," he told the 2,000
participants at the WEF annual meeting at which the participants
focused their discussions on the theme of "Responsible
Globalization."

CAIRO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANNA -- A Yemeni official has estimated the economic losses
resulting from the abduction of foreigners last month at no less
than 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the General Tourism Authority Abdul Rahman Maiyhoub
said the kidnaping incidents, in which some of the hostages were
killed, have brought disastrous consequences to the Yemeni
tourism, the Arabic Al-Haiyat newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The national airlines and tourist agencies were badly hurt by
the abductions last month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial reports said up to 95 percent of tourists canceled
their planned trip to Yemen in January.
</P>
<P>
JEDDA -- Saudi retail in the holy fasting month of Ramadan was
depressed despite price reductions and other means of
consumer-attracting such as giveaway, quiz and luxuries offered by
trade centers.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Haiyat said Sunday that the retail sales in this Ramadan
rose only 40 percent compared with 200 percent in previous years'
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Water deficit in the Arab region is expected to be
313 billion cubic meters in 2025 in case the current water
policies adopted by the Arab countries remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
If the efficiency in water use rose from 50 percent to 70
percent, about 40 billion cubic meters can be saved to irrigate
2.5 million hectares of farmland, the Arabic daily Al-Alam Al-Youm
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The lastest annual report issued by the Arab Economic Unity
Council said the water resources in the Arab world stand at

France is the biggest investor in Tunis, accounting for 29
percent of the total investment, which was followed by Italy, 21
percent; Germany, 15 percent and Belgium, 5.9 percent, the Al-Alam
Al-Youm reported Sunday.

LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said Sunday that Britain was to enforce the southern
no-fly zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He issued a statement after the British Royal Air Force
attacked Iraqi military sites for the first time since the joint
British-U.S. air strikes in December.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry confirmed reports that two of its Tornado
aircraft were among the eight planes that attacked two Iraqi
communications facilities Sunday after an Iraqi warplane entered
the southern no-fly zone over its territory.
</P>
<P>
"This action by Royal Air Force aircraft demonstrates our
continuing commitment to the humanitarian task of enforcing the
no-fly zone in Iraq," Robertson said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This action sends the clearest possible message to (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein that his provocations will not deflect
us from our aim and that our aircraft will take whatever action is
necessary to defend themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone was established after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's attack was the first time British aircraft had fired
on Iraqi military sites since the four-day-long joint British-U.S.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite its concern over a
possible decline in oil revenues, Iran's Majlis (parliament) on
Sunday approved the budget bill for the new Iranian calendar year
to start on March 21.
</P>
<P>
The balanced budget was approved at about 157.8 billion
U.S. dollars, of which about 62.7 billion dollars are for the
government budget and the rest for state-run companies, banks and
firms.
</P>
<P>
The government is authorized to pay expenditures according to
the budgeted revenue, IRNA said. But many Majlis deputies doubted
if the government can realize the budgeted revenue as the world
oil market has shown little sign of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The new budget expects 12.1 billion dollars from oil incomes at
an average oil price of 11.8 dollars per barrel, including 10.6
billion dollars in crude exports and 1.5 billion dollars from gas
and oil products.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure social justice, the new budget allocated 4.3
billion dollars to food subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis also set aside 5.7 million dollars to help the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami carry out his proposal on
dialogue of civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The budget must be approved by the conservative Guardians
Council before it takes effect.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Attacks on Iraq Air Defense Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes attacked
Iraqi air defense sites in both southern and northern no-fly zones
for the second straight day Sunday, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
In southern Iraq, six U.S. and two British planes fired on two
military sites in response to "Iraqi provocations," according to a
statement released by the U.S. Central Command in MacDill air base
in Tampa, Florida.
</P>
<P>
"The targets were a communications repeater station at Talil
and a radio relay facility at Al Amarah," said Maj. Joe LaMarca, a
Central Command spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said they were targeted because of their role in aircraft
command and control. Destroying the facilities would impair the
ability of Iraqi aircraft to fly in the southern no-fly zone, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the northern no-fly zone, a U.S. Air Force F-16CJ fighting
Falcon launched a high-speed anti-radiation missile (HARM), at a
radar system north of the city of Mosul, according to a statement
from Operation Northern Watch in Incirlik air base, southern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The radar system posed a threat to the F-16 and coalition
forces conducting routine enforcement of the northern no-fly
zone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, U.S. fighter jets fired missiles on Iraqi air
defense sites in six incidents around the city of Mosul. It was
the single largest number of confrontations in a single day since
the confrontations in no-fly zones between Iraq and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has vowed to fight U.S. and
British warplanes entering Iraq air space, saying the no-fly zones
violate international law.

</P>
<P>
Lawrence Collins, representing the Chilean government before
Britain's House of Lords which is currently rehearing Pinochet's
case, argued that the retired general should not be extradited to
Spain to face charges of torture, hostage-taking and murder.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the rehearing on whether Pinochet should enjoy
immunity from prosecution abroad as a former head of state went
into its third week.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the rehearing would end on Wednesday or
Thursday. The panel formed by of seven Law Lords will then take a
few days before announcing their decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Collins told the Law Lords that the current Chilean government,
which had never seeking to hide the facts of what went on between
1973 and 1990 when Pinochet ruled Chile, had "endeavoured to get
out details of these matters".
</P>
<P>
"My instructions are to make absolutely clear that the
Government of Chile does deplore these events but considers that
these are not matters for foreign courts."
</P>
<P>
A panel of five Law Lords ruled in November by three to two
that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution. That decision
opened the way for Pinochet to be extradited to Spain to face
charges of murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
But the judgment was set aside after it emerged that one of the
five judges had very strong links with Amnesty International, the
human right body which had been allowed to make submissions to the
court.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, arrested on October 16 in a London hospital where he
was recovering from a minor operation, is now living under police
guard in a mansion west of London under police guard.

<HEADLINE> "Focus Lanka" Promotion Inaugurated in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Minister of
Industrial Development C.V. Gooneratne on Monday inaugurated the
first segment of the "Focus Lanka" economic promotion drive at
Sydney, Australia, said reports reaching here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed the captains of Australian industry to
become more economically engaged with Sri Lanka, as the country
had continued to maintain its economic growth despite the Asian
currency crisis, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
This comprehensive economic promotional drive, the first of its
kind to be held in Australia, is aimed at attracting greater
Australian investment, finding wider markets for Sri Lankan
products and promoting Sri Lanka as a travel destination.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's High Commissioner to Australia Bandara described
the event as a further expansion of Sri Lanka into Australia which
was already the second largest investor country in the island,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the promotional drive includes an investment
promotion seminar, one to one business meeting, a trade
exhibition, a food festival and cultural show.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka week in Sydney will go on until February 3, while
"Focus Lanka" will move to Melbourne on February 5 and conclude on
 February 11, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income and Spending in U.S. Surge in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Americans' personal income
surged 0.5 percent in December, the best showing in 10 months, the
Commerce Department reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in personal income followed 0.4 percent gains in
October and November, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Personal spending rose 0.8 percent in December, the biggest
increase in seven months, bolstered by last-minute holiday
shopping and a continuing rebound in auto sales following summer
strikes at General Motors. That followed a modest 0.2 percent
increase in November.
</P>
<P>
Income in 1998 rose a healthy 5 percent. The increase rate of
personal income has been at or above that level since 1994, and
last year saw the smallest rise in five years.
</P>
<P>
The robust growth of 6.7 percent increase in wages and salaries
-- the most-watched component of income -- was partly offset by a
23.6 percent plunge in farm owners' income, reflecting the
worldwide economic slump's impact on commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
Spending jumped 5.7 percent in 1998, the largest gain in four
years. It was propelled by a 7.5 percent increase for big-ticket
durable goods, as low interest rates fueled car sales and record
home sales encouraged strong sales of furniture and appliances.
</P>
<P>
Because Americans spent more than they earned, their personal
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income --
went negative in December, the second time in the past year. It
was zero in September, minus 0.1 percent in October, positive 0.1
percent in November and minus 0.1 percent again in December.
</P>
<P>
For the year, Americans saved just 0.5 percent of their income,
the least since 1933, compared with 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The low savings rate came because prosperous Americans spent a
portion of their stock-market gains and tapped their home equity
during a wave of refinancing spurred by the lowest mortgage rates
since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In December, wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent. Service
industries showed a brisk 0.7 percent gain and manufacturing, a
more subdued 0.2 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Spending during the month was led by a 4.2 percent surge for
durable goods, items expected to last three or more years. It was
the largest gain in five and a half years. Spending on services
rose 0.4 percent and on nondurable goods, 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Space Rose Found to Have Different Aroma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists said that
space rose has different aroma from that of rose on Earth,
according to Monday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the International Flavors and Fragrances Inc.
said that an analysis of the molecules of the roses once they were
returned to Earth found a significant change in the chemical
composition that caused a notable but pleasant difference.
</P>
<P>
The roses were aboard the space shuttle with John Glenn last
October in an experiment to determine whether fragrances change in
microgravity.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company sponsored the experiment which uses
a special device to capture the chemical molecules of the scent
produced by the rose plant.
</P>
<P>
On Earth the rose produces an intense green rose aroma but in
space the smell is a more floral aroma which is aesthetically
pleasing, said the scientists.
</P>
<P>
This transformation has created a completely new fragrance
that is not of this Earth, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prosecutors, Lawyers Start to Question Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors and
White House lawyers began to question former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky about her affair with President Bill Clinton and
charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying
to conceal their relationship.
</P>
<P>
The deposition of Lewinsky is taking place at Washington's
Mayflower Hotel, presided over by one Democratic and one
Republican senator and videotaped for viewing by other senators.
</P>
<P>
The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close
friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Lewinsky find a job, will be
deposed, and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal
will be questioned.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anybody to think there's some big bombshell out
there," Bill McCollum, a Republican lawmaker, one of the 13 House
trial prosecutors, said of his expectations from the Lewinsky
testimony.
</P>
<P>
McCollum, interviewed on "Fox News Sunday," said the
prosecutors hoped to nail down "beyond a reasonable doubt that the
president committed a crime" by trying to get Lewinsky to conceal
gifts he had given her.
</P>
<P>
White House lawyers argue that Lewinsky has testified under
oath more than 20 times and has said consistently that she was
never told to lie or offered a job to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
Barring some startling new revelation from the depositions,
Senate Republicans and Democrats have agreed that the final vote
in the trial should come February 12.
</P>
<P>
It takes a two-thirds majority of 67 to convict the president
and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
The trial is to resume Thursday, after senators have had a
chance to review the three depositions. Only then will they decide
whether any of those witnesses will be called for live testimony
in the Senate chamber. Democrats are adamantly opposed to that,
and some Republicans also have said that shouldn't be necessary
unless new information comes out of the depositions that could
change the course of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. At the moment, no one believes there are enough
votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The country's construction
spending surged 1.7 percent in December, the largest gain in six
months, helped by unseasonably mild weather for much of the month,
the Commerce Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Construction spending for all the year of 1998 rose 6.3 percent

<HEADLINE> World Champion Guo Says China Deprived of Two Golds </HEADLINE>

<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, February 1 (Xinhua) -- World Cup
winner Guo Dandan of China said on Monday here that China
delegates would have been deprived of two free style skiing golds
in the Winter Asiad in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The host has the advantage to set up events in the Games,
otherwise China would definitely win two more golds in the free
style aerial jumping skiing competitions," said Guo, who won a
World Cup in 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, who is staging the Fourth Asian Winter Games in
Yongypong, canceled the free style aerial jumping skiing events,
leaving the regional competition without world-class athletes like
Olympic silver medalist Xu Nannan and her Chinese teammate Ji Xiao'
ou and Guo, defending champion in the women's event in the last
edition of the Games.
</P>
<P>
China won the men's and women's golds of the events in Harbin
of China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The host is atop so far in the medal standings with eight golds
in the Winter Asiad, while China is trailing with six golds at
second.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Xu is regretting of missing the glory chance in
the Games. "It's unfair to blame the hosts, but I'm quiet sorry
for not to compete in the Winter Asiad."
</P>
<P>
Xu narrowly missed the first Winter Olympic gold for China when
she took a silver medal with the highest results of the jumping in
the Nagano Olympics last February in Japan.
</P>

"I hope to realize my gold-medal dream in the Salt Lake City
Games in 2002," Xu added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Improve Reception Facilities for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Monday that it plans to improve reception facilities for the
increasing number of refugees flowing into EU crisis areas
including Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Improvements will be made to 76 reception facilities and will
amount to 16.75 million euro (18.92 million U.S. dollars) in
member countries of the union.
</P>
<P>
The funds will also be spent on providing facilities that will
attempt to assist those who are willing to acquire the necessary
skills and means to return home.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of the 76 facilities concern with the reception of
refugees, asylum seekers and displaced people, and 52 concerned
assistants for voluntary return.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, has tried to ensure that particularly vulnerable
groups such as children and women are included in as many
reception projects as possible.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, European commissioner responsible for justice and
home affairs, said that asylum and migration issues are
increasingly becoming a matter of common concern within the 15
member states.
</P>
<P>
In some EU member countries, facilities are not adequate to
meet the influx of refugees, asylum seekers and displaced people.
Major beneficiaries of this improvement plan include Germany,
Spain and Italy where pressures are particularly acute.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Avert Water Crisis in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will be among a small
group of countries which won't face the water crisis throughout
the 21st century, said an international study of water management
released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
David Seckler, the author of the study called "New Report",
said that Thailand would be one of few countries in the world
which would have enough water for humans and crops until 2100.
</P>
<P>
The prediction already took into account the country's rising
population, increased water use and the growing demand for more
food, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report came when major newspapers in Thailand were piling
up stories of drought and water crisis in the countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has appeared to face water shortages in recent months
due to widespread drought. The country has tried to alleviate the
problem through measures, including conducting rain shower
projects in key areas and campaigns to increase public awareness
to preserve water.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the world water demand over the next 100
years would increase drastically with some areas possibly facing
water crisis and upheavals, namely the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, in overall there would not have any severe
water problem in the foreseeable future due to improved irrigation
methods and techniques.
</P>
<P>
Seckler suggested countries facing water problem shift water
from the agricultural sector, which accounts for 70 percent of all
the water used by humans, to industries. New desalination projects
are also recommended to provide enough drinking water in some
cities.
</P>
<P>
"By 2025, given current trend, the world will need 62 percent
more fresh water to maintain the present living standards. The
easiest way to pursue this trend is to improve the irrigation
system and techniques, currently run at only 30 percent
efficiently," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast that Thailand would then become
increasingly important to feed the world, as its neighbors would
face water problem ranking from only 25 percent to nearly 100
percent over the next 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Kills 4,800 Angolans in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan health authorities
said here Monday that malaria is still the number one killer in
the southern African country, killing 4,849 Angolans in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the National Coordination
Office of Malaria Control, some 102,000 cases were recorded in
the hospitals in the past year across the country, and 94,952 of
them were serious ones.
</P>
<P>
The office noted that the figures did not include those cases
out of its control. It was estimated that there are some three
million malaria cases per year in the country with a population
of only 10 million people, with 12,000 people killed.
</P>
<P>
Malaria was prevalent in such provinces as Luanda, Benguela,
Malanjo and Huila because it is rainy and humid, suitable for the
growth of mosquitos while these provinces are densely populated.
</P>
<P>
The anti-malaria office admitted that civil war has severely
damaged the medical equipment, denying many sufferers the access
to early treatment and needed medicines.
</P>
<P>
The sanitary conditions worsened as the war forced a large
number of refugees to pour into the urban areas, helping the
spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, there were 56,838 malarial cases recorded with a
death toll of 3,591.
</P>
<P>
Besides malaria, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and trypanosomiasis
are also major killers in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Diarrhoea killed some 30,000 people in the war-torn country
last year.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government Monday
decided to provide each of 4.2 million card-holding poor families
with 20 kilograms of foodgrains free of cost per month from
January to March this year under the vulnerable group feeding
(VGF) program, the official BSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at an inter-ministerial meeting of the
Special Committee on Post-Flood Foodgrain Procurement and
Distribution Monitoring and Review.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided at the meeting that additional 252,000 tons
of foodgrains were allocated for the program.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the VGF program last year to assist the
destitute families which were badly hit by the flood and got their
VGF cards.
</P>
<P>
The food stock position is now satisfactory with a total of
1.213 million tons of foodgrains at the stock. 16 ships carrying
72,000 tons of rice and 381,000 tons of wheat, under grain and
cash imports, will reach the country this month.

in the July-September period last year, which inundated about
two-thirds of the country and seriously affected over 30 million
people.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already made encouraging
achievements in reducing the sufferings of the flood-affected
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Biswa Ijtema, the
second largest gathering of Muslims across the world, ended on
Monday in Tongi, about 22 kilometers north of the Bangladeshi
capital, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The gathering ended with Akheri Munajat, the day's concluding
prayer, seeking divine blessings for world peace, progress and
prosperity for Muslims and strengthening brotherhood of Muslim
Ummah.
</P>
<P>
Over 2 million people, including devout Muslims from 45 foreign
countries, joined the 34th Biswa Ijtema, the largest Muslim
congregation after Hajj in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
President Shahbuddin Ahmed, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
government officials, members of parliament and political leaders
joined the Munajat, together with diplomats from Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, especially those from the capital and its

by all modes of transports or on foot to attend the Munajat.
</P>

Several hundred small shops of essential goods such as food,
clothes, blankets and shoes were installed, and many temporary

<HEADLINE> China Wins Five Golds, Host Keeps Lead at Medal Tally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGYPONG, South Korea, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China won the
most gold medals of five on Monday but South Korea kept the lead
at the medal table with eight by adding four more today at the
Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Japan joint the gold medal family with the China, South Korea
and Kazakhstan, by taking the women's 5-km cross country skiing
classic through Yokoyama Sumiko.
</P>
<P>
China balanced its gold medals collection in the fields with
two on the snow and three through the skaters Monday, helping
China to collet six gold.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shumei, fifth of the Winter Olympics last February, won the
women's 15-km biathlon without any unexpection. She was followed
by her teammate Liu Xianying and Kazakstan Margarita Dulova.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan won the event at the last Games.
</P>
<P>
But it was unexpected for China when its new national champion
Zhang Qing beat Dmitriy Pozonyakov to win the men's 20-km biathlon.
</P>
<P>
"We never thought Zhang would win the event this time because
Kazakhstan and Japan were stronger than us," said Li Geng, head of
the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
China also took home three gold medals in the short track
speedskating like South Korea did on Monday. However the host won
six of 10 golds awarded in the two-day sport.
</P>
<P>
Both Yang Yang (A) of China and Kim Dong-sung of South Korea
won their second gold medal by adding one more victory in day's
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Indoor Ice Rink in Yongpyong, however, saw most exciting
contests in the men's 5,000m and women's 3,000m relays as China
took the men's, the last short track gold here, while South Korea
won the women's.
</P>
<P>
Japan took the men's silver and South Korea third. Japan also
took the silver in the women's relay. Defending champion China was
disqualified for fouls.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A), who won the 500 meters Sunday, led China a 1-2
win in the women's 1,000m race to become the first athlete to take
two individual golds at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Yang's teammate Wang Chunlu took the silver. But another
Chinese star Yang Yang (S) was disqualified in the four-person
medal final. Wang was followed by South Korea's Kim Yun-mi.
</P>
<P>
"The gold should be ours," said Yang Yang (A), defending
titlist. "The victory was also the outcome of our team efforts."
</P>
<P>
Kim Dong-jung, winner of the men's 1,500m Monday, took the 3,
000m for his second gold. Another South Korean Lee Jun-hwan was
second, followed by China's An Yulong.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1,000m, Feng Kai won the gold. Kim Dong-sung took
the silver after An Yulong, who finished the line in second, was
disqualified. Imai Hideto of Japan took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The argument occurred again on the Indoor Ice Rink in Yongpyong
when China made its third protest in the written form following An
falling down and lost the chance to qualify for the 1,000 meters
final.
</P>
<P>
"It should be a foul by Kim Dong-sung, who used his elbow to
push An falling. Kim should be disqualified," said Chinese coach
Xin Qingshan
</P>
<P>
New star Kim Moon-jung added one gold to South Korea's haul of
medal table when the 17-year-old girl won the 3,000m race by
beating Wang Chunlu and her teammate Choi Min-kyung to second and
third respectively.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also won a gold on the snow as You Hae-min, also 17-
year-old, claimed the Alpine skiing women's S-Giant slalom. The
silver also went to South Korean Yang Woo-Young, and third was
Kazakhstan's Olag Vedyasheva.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan won all but the women's relay in the Biathlon events
at the last Winter Asiad. So far it only took one gold in the
sport and the Games.

<HEADLINE> UK Still Most Expensive Car Market in EU: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain is still the most
expensive car market in the European Union while the Netherlands
is the cheapest, announced a European union survey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on data available to November 1, 1998. The
survey compared prices for the 76 best-selling models of cars
within the 15-nation union. It found that 57 of them carry the
highest price tags in Britain, while 20 of them carry the cheapest
price tags in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Spain, Portugal and Sweden were proclaimed to be joining the
Netherlands as the cheapest market for cars. Overall, however, car
price differentials are on a downward trend, said European
Commission official Krouse Heiber who attributed the trend to a
depreciation of the British pound and the price-cutting measures
taken by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, in an attempt to provide consumers with an
overview on the car market, started conducting surveys in 1993 on
the markets of different European Union member states.

<HEADLINE> Six South Korean Prosecutors Sacked for Taking Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korean state prosecution
authorities Monday sacked six prosecutors after a month-long probe
into a bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 prosecutors and five judges either received money
from or were lavishly entertained by Lee Chong-ki, a lawyer who
was the key figure in what is regarded as the most humiliating
event in the South Korean judiciary history, a spokesman from the
Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office (SPPO) said.
</P>
<P>
Apologizing for the scandal, Prosecutor General Kim Tae-joung
said: "I deeply regret the disappointment caused by the scandal.
The prosecution will devote itself to uprooting all corrupt
practices in order to establish a new work ethic in the legal
community."
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly wiped away tears while reading the statement,
pledging a sweeping reform of the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The scandal should serve as momentum to clear the
irregularities plaguing the legal establishment, and help to
regain public trust in the justice system, he added.
</P>
<P>
The scandal was exposed on January 7 this year when Kim Hyun, a
former chief clerk of lawyer Lee Chong-ki, leaked secret documents
that included a list of hundreds of judiciary officials who
allegedly introduced cases to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chong-ki was arrested on charges of corruption. It's
reported that he admitted that he had paid 118 million won (about
98,000 U.S.dollars) in payoffs to about 100 government, court and
prison officials who introduced 202 clients to him between 1994
and 1997.

<HEADLINE> China, South Korea Split Skating Golds on Final Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGYPONG, South Korea, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China and South
Korea each took home three gold medals on Monday, final day of the
short track speedskating competition, but the host won six of 10
golds awarded in the event at the Winter Asiad here.
</P>
<P>
Both Yang Yang (A) of China and Kim Dong-sung of South Korea
doubled their gold medals when Yang triumphed in women's 1,000m
and Kim won in men's 3,000m in the day's competitions.
</P>
<P>
China called the day with the men's 5,000m relay, the most
exciting contests of the night in the Indoor Ice Rink in Yongpyong,
following the gold of women's 3,000m relay going to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion China was disqualified by fouls in the women'
s part of the relay with Japan took two silver medals in the
events.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A), who won the 500m Sunday, led China 1-2 finish in
the women's 1,000m race, timing 1:45.516, to become the first
athlete to take two individual golds at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Yang's teammate Wang Chunlu took the silver in 1:45.565. But
another Chinese star Yang Yang (S) was disqualified in the four-
person medal final. Wang was followed by South Korea's Kim Yun-mi
at third in 1:45.852.
</P>
<P>
"We deserve the gold medal," said reigning champion Yang Yang (
A) after 1,000m race. "It's the team efforts that win the glory."
</P>
<P>
Kim Dong-jung, winner of the men's 1,500m Monday, took the 3,
000m title for his second gold. Another South Korean Lee Jun-hwan
was second, followed by China's An Yulong.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1,000m, Feng Kai clocked 1:37.194 to win the gold.
Kim Dong-sung took the silver after An Yulong, who crossed the
sprint line at second, was disqualified. Imai Hideto won the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
The argument occurred again on the Indoor Ice Rink in Yongpyong
when China made its third protest in the written form following An
falling down and lost the chance to qualify for the 1,000m final.
</P>
<P>
"It should be a foul by Kim Dong-sung, who used his elbow to
push An falling. Kim should be disqualified," said Chinese coach
Xin Qingshan.
</P>
<P>
New star Kim Moon-jung added one gold to South Korea when the
17-year-old girl won the 3,000m race by beating Wang Chunlu and
her teammate Choi Min-kyung to second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
China and South Korea split 10 gold medals at the last edition
of the Games in Harbin, China, in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Car Robbery Rampant in Uganda's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Car and cash robberies have
been rampant in Uganda's capital city of Kampala since the
beginning of 1999, a senior police officer said here Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Namanya, the regional police commander of Kampala
extra, told a press conference in the central police station that
four-wheel-drive pickups are the hot targets of the armed thugs.
</P>
<P>
The stolen vehicles are often transported to the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) where the tough road conditions require
them, Namanya said.
</P>
<P>
There have been four such vehicles retrieved by police so far
since the start of 1999, he asserted, adding that investigations
of most of the stolen vehicles are still under way.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, some arms are exhibited including
rifles, pistols, live ammunition and grenades.
</P>
<P>
A total of 51 million Shillings (51,000 U.S. Dollars) has been
robbed in the city, the police officer revealed, hoping people to
handle their cash with more care.
</P>
<P>
He also called on civilians to report to the police immediately
and correctly once they are robbed, urging the general public to
cooperate closely with the police against robbery and other
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
He said his men are willing to cooperate with their
counterparts in the DRC in bringing thieves and robbers to book.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the source of arms of the robbers, he said
that some robbers erased the serial numbers on the weapons so you
cannot decide where the weapons are from.
</P>
<P>
However, robbers usually hire their weapons from police
officers, soldiers, security personnel or get them from the above
people by force.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains Competitive Beyond Asian Crisis: Rep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is increasingly
acting as a major metropolitan management and coordination center
for local firms, for business activities in the Chinese mainland
and for multinational companies, the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council said.
</P>
<P>
That is why the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
remains competitive beyond the Asian economic crisis, the council
said in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's future development strategies should continue to
build on such a basis, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report said Hong Kong is already a regional center which
increasingly relies on economic activities that go beyond the
geographic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Its role as a metropolitan center for coordinating, managing
and servicing economic activities that take place beyond its
boundaries has become the dominant influence on the SAR's economic
performance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Hong Kong's future prosperity will depend on the
ability of its companies to maintain and improve their competitive
positions and international linkages to serve local, national,
regional and global markets.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed the need to broaden and deepen the
relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in such
fields as infrastructure, commerce, environmental issues, cultural
and educational exchanges and information sharing.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation and deflation in other economies have widened the
cost differential for many goods and services and so further
adjustment of prices and wages might still be necessary for Hong
Kong to compete, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Economy, Jobs Remain Top Public Concerns in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The economy and the
unemployment situation remain the most concerned issues among the
public in Hong Kong, according to recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
The results came from the bimonthly public opinion surveys
conducted by the Home Affairs Bureau (HAB) of Hong Kong, and the
latest survey was carried out from January 11 to 15.
</P>
<P>
A HAB spokesman said Monday that the economy-related problems
were still the major concern of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
"At 61 percent, it was only five percentage points lower than
the record high set in July 1998 at 66 percent. It was only
marginally higher than the 60 percent recorded in the September
1998 survey," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We can only surmise that this was only a carryover of the
generally depressed public mood across the region resulting from
the Asian financial crisis. Public sentiments could have been
aggravated by news concerning bad debts in local banks,
bankruptcies affecting a number of high-profile Chinese state-
owned companies and the fallout from the Brazilian currency crisis,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 46 percent who mentioned labor-related problems, 96
percent of them mentioned difficulties in finding jobs, or being
laid off or underemployed. In May last year, labor issues were
mentioned by 54 percent of the respondents, topping all other
problems.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed a generally more negative perception
of the overall situation and prospects for immediate improvement.
</P>
<P>
The survey is the 80th in the series. It was carried out by
telephone interview with 1,649 respondents aged 15 to 64 selected
by random sampling, using the residential telephone directories.

On the contrary, Primakov said, it destroyed all hopes for the

Tass reported Monday.
</P>

He stressed that de-privatization in Russia is impossible
because the oligarchs who acquired many enterprises and companies

CAIRO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Some 100 Iranian exporting, manufacturing, industrial
and mining companies are to put on display their products in the
second international trade fair to be staged in Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia from February 20 to March 19.
</P>
<P>
Iran is to set up a 2,000-square-meter pavilion for its
companies, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran sent its companies to the fair aiming at expanding mutual
economic and trade cooperation, absorbing foreign investments and
marketing Iranian-made goods.
</P>
<P>
Iran is to establish a commercial bureau in Dhahran in
the near future to enhance marketing of Iranian commodities on
Saudi markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Palestinian self-rule areas registered a gross
domestic product (GDP) of 4.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, a
3.5 percent growth from that of the 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority Fuad
Hamdi Bassisso told a press conference on Saturday that per capita
GDP declined from 1,430 dollars in 1997 to 1,380 dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
The decline was mainly attributed to the fact that population
growth is greater than the rise in domestic product.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco generated some 804 million U.S. dollars of
revenues from fish exporting in 1998, up by 10 percent from 1997,
the Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The demand for Moroccan fish registered steady increase in the
markets of the European Union (EU), Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the revenues of the maritime fishing sector is
basically attributed to the increase in demand and prices rise in
the international market, particularly with regard to sardines for
EU countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Figures from the Syrian Central Bureau of
Statistics show that Syria's gross domestic product stood at 1,294
billion liras (25.88 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, up 12.2
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The capital volume, in the public and private sectors,
increased to 188 billion liras (3.76 billion dollars) as compared
to 169 billion liras (3.38 billion dollars)in 1997.

the total capital component by some 10.7 percent as compared to

dollars) in 1997 to 93 billion liras (1.86 billion dollars) in
1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Monday it would be hard for Glenn Hoddle to remain in
his position as England coach if his remarks about the disabled
are true as reported.
</P>
<P>
"If he has said what he was reported to have said in the way he
is reported to have said it, then it was very wrong," Blair said
in a television interview. "It would be very difficult for him to
stay. It was very offensive."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle, 41, will have his future as England coach decided by
the English Football Association (F.A.) in the next 24 hours, said
interim chief executive David Davies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The England coach put himself in the flurry of criticism by a
report in Saturday's Times newspaper quoting him as saying that
disabled people were paying for sins in a past life.
</P>
<P>
"You and I have been physically given two hands and two legs
and a half-decent brain. Some people have not been born like that
for a reason. The karma is working from another lifetime," Hoddle
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said his remarks had been misconstrued.

<HEADLINE> China's Spring Season Transport Starts Today (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China's annual large scale
movement of people returning home for the Spring Festival began
today.
</P>
<P>
 Known as the Spring Season Transport, it occurs before and
after the country's biggest holiday.
</P>
<P>
 Those involved are usually migrating laborers, college
students in their winter holidays, people working in other regions
and places returning to their hometowns to visit relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
 In recent years more and more people have traveled during the
Spring Festival holidays and according to sociologists this is
attributed to increasing regional economic exchange and gradually-
improved living conditions.
</P>
<P>
 As a result the Chinese Government has to decide the Spring
Season Transport period every year, within which the country's
transport system will go all out to ensure that the migration goes
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
 The period this year is from February 1 through March 12.
</P>
<P>
 China's transport departments predicted that during the 40-
day period, the passenger transport volume will reach 1.56 billion
arrivals and departures, up 3.6 percent on an annual basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott arrived here Monday for the eighth round of
talks with Pakistani officials on peace and security and
non-proliferation issues.
</P>
<P>
Concluding a three-day similar exercise in New Delhi on Sunday,
Talbott is scheduled to hold talks with Pakistani Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Tuesday morning, in which peace and
security, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
non-proliferation and lifting of remaining U.S. sanctions will be
focused on.
</P>
<P>
"Like the earlier seven round, we look forward to having useful
and productive discussion in our meeting tomorrow," said Shamshad
in his statement on arrival of Talbott on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"During the eight months of our dialogue," he said, "we believe
we have covered a good distance in narrowing down our perceptional
divergence and reconciling our respective concerns and
objectives."
</P>
<P>
"The agenda is not confined to non-proliferation issues alone
but also cover the far deeper issues of peace and security at the
heart of which lies the Kashmir problem which has in fact been the
cause of impelling proliferation in our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "we seek more active engagement of the United States in
finding a just and final settlement of this issue."
</P>
<P>
He also said that "we are not aiming at any signed agreement...
we are only aiming at achieving greater re-conciliation of our
legitimate security concerns with the non-proliferation objectives
of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot pre-judge the outcome of the talks at this stage but
given the convergence of views reflected in the previous rounds we
are hopeful of a very constructive and productive round of talks,"
the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
In the seven rounds of talks Talbott held separately with
Pakistani and Indian officials since May, 1998, when the two South
Asian countries carried out their nuclear tests, some progress has
been made towards the United States's objectives of security and
non-proliferation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has agreed to sign the CTBT by September, 1999, and
Indian Prime Minister Behari Vajpayee has promised that his
country will not block the Treaty from coming into force in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is still far short of the ultimate purpose of
American endeavor: freezing further nuclearization of South Asian
with a view to its returning to a wholly non-nuclear status.
</P>
<P>
The eighth round of talks between Talbott and Indian officials
ended Sunday with an agreement to meet again, but no sign of any
substantive breakthrough was seen.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in Islamabad, Talbott will also call on
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sahrif and Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Talbott will hold discussions with Pakistani
officials on Afghanistan in a bid to oblige the Taliban militia,
through Pakistan's influence, to withdraw its shelter to Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi dissident wanted by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Cases Drops but Commercial Frauds Rises in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of criminal cases
dropped while the number of commercial frauds and drug-related
cases rose in Vietnam in 1998, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, VNA quoted sources from the Police General
Department under Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security as saying
that the people's police throughout the country investigated and
discovered over 35,000 criminal cases involving 49,700 offenders,
arrested 4,200 law breakers involved in 2,050 cases, and
investigated into more than 4,100 criminal rings, arresting more
than 13,600 wrongdoers. The police also arrested or purged 15,550
wanted criminals, including over 3,780 classified as particularly
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The number of robberies dropped by 5.41 percent in 1998
compared to the previous year, that of child kidnappings dropped
by 10.42 percent, and that of deliberately causing injuries
dropped by 5.46 percent.
</P>

However, VNA quoted the police as saying that violations of the
criminal code remained high in 1998, especially in big cities,
which accounted for over one-third of the total criminal cases
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 15,000 economic cases were uncovered, including 2,300
cases of socialist property embezzlement, caused losses estimated

dollars) to public funds. It is a year-on-year increase of three
percent compared to the previous year. The economic police
discovered 1,170 corruption cases which caused losses worth 892.67
billion VND (64 million U.S. dollars) to the state fund last year,
up by 34 per cent compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>
They also detected over 13,000 smuggling cases and commercial
frauds, confiscating illegal goods worth 509.23 billion VND (36.4
million U.S. dollars) and collecting tax arrears and fines worth
137.31 billion VND (nearly 10 million U.S. dollars). The number of
smuggling cases and commercial frauds and the value of confiscated
goods in 1998 rose 51 percent and 70 percent, respectively,
compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- People in southern Somalia are
not only dying for famine caused by droughts and civil war, but
wild beasts are also preying on them in the midst of their search
for food.
</P>
<P>
At least four people were killed and several others were
wounded when famine-displaced people were attacked by a pride of
lions at Didow village, some 50 kilometers northeast of the border
town of EI-Bardeh near Ethiopia in the seriously famine affected
region of Bakol Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ugas Abdi Ugas Hussein Ugas Khalif, a traditional leader of
EI-Bardeh town, Monday told this reporter via VHF radio that the
deceased include a woman and her infant daughter and two elderly
men.
</P>
<P>
The wounded are now being treated in the local treatment center
of the town, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the displaced people put the death number at more than
seven, saying that many more still remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
"The area around Didow village was long known as the den
haunted by lions, but since the civil war spread in the region, no
one had believed that they could still be there," said Abdufatah
Eydarus, another resident in EI-Bardeh.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families mainly women, children and elderly people
have reportedly left their villages in southern Somalia on their
way of crossing the border into Ethiopia in search of food.
</P>
<P>
There is serious food shortage throughout Somalia especially in
the southern, central and northeastern regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 people are said to be suffering from food
shortages, especially in the southern regions of the Horn of
Africa country.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Pledges More Support for Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Monday promised to double state funding for the coal
industry and urged miners to cooperate with the government in
getting over the current difficulties, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The government will raise this year's state subsidy to the coal
industry from 5.8 billion rubles (255 million U.S. dollars) to 10-
12 billion rubles (439-527 million dollars), Primakov told an
extraordinary session of the All-Russia Miners' Congress in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"Unity between trade unions, the government and local
authorities is necessary. Nothing will happen without that,"
Primakov said. "Let's not scare each other, Mutual threats will
yield no results."
</P>
<P>
He also called for "decisive action to improve the situation in
the coal industry," where miners seldom receive their wages more
than once every five months on the average. In some enterprises,
wage arrears have lasted for 12-13 months.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that disgruntled miners resorted to blocking
railroads last year to press the government and their employers
for payment of back wages.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the federal government should take some
blame for the plight of the industry, Primakov pointed his finger
at economic crimes and misuse of funds that have plagued the
sector in recent years. As a result, billions of dollars in coal-
export proceeds failed to return to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"That is the money which should have paid the miners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reiterated that his government's policy of developing
the domestic industry as a top priority. He also listed tax reform,
banking system restructuring, and the improvement of the
investment environment as its main tasks.

<TEXT>

JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's port and
sherry producers will continue to use these fortified wine names
for 12 years if a deal hammered out at the weekend in Davos,
Switzerland, is endorsed by South Africa and the European Union
(EU), Business Day paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and EU
commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro Friday announced a compromise
that would enable the two parties to finalize a final free trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two men would not disclose the details of the compromise.
However, it is understood that while South Africa may retain
"port" and "sherry" as its trade marks, the arrangement will be
reviewed after 12 years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The compromise will have to be ratified by the South African
cabinet and the EU Council of Ministers respectively.
</P>
<P>
The dispute on "port" and "sherry" has been a major obstacle to
the conclusion of the free trade negotiations, which have lingered
for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
The EU insists that South African producers stop using these
terms because only wines produced in Portugal and Spain can be
called port and sherry respectively.

that each home in the sub county eventually obtains a heifer from
the scheme.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- KwaZulu-Natal Premier Ben
Ngubane has been removed from office, South African media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released Sunday, Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Ngubane said that the
removal was made because of poor matric results in the province.
</P>
<P>
"As premier of the province, Dr B.S. Ngubane carries the final
responsibility for the delivery of essential services by the
KwaZulu-Natal government," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"While recognizing that the KwaZulu-Natal government and its
leadership have tried their best to make the province's education
system a successful one, it is clear that this year's matric
results have shown that even their best was objectively not good
enough," it added.
</P>
<P>
The IFP is the ruling party in KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
Provincial education minister Vincent Zulu was also fired.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that South African Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology, Lionel Mtshali, would take over
as KwaZulu-Natal Premier.
</P>
<P>
However, there was speculation that Ngubane would take over
Mtshali's national portfolio, which he held before becoming
KwaZulu-Natal Finance Minister and later Premier.
</P>
<P>
Business Day newspaper quoted sources as saying that the
African National Congress (ANC) top brass was dissatisfied with
Mtshali who, apart from a public spat with his director-general
Roger Jardine, was involved in a row with the United States
government.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi was apparently unhappy with Ngubane's performance
after a dispute concerning casino licenses, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement denied the allegations that Ngubane was
removed because of his handling of gambling in the province.
</P>
<P>
It said Ngubane would sort out this problem before leaving the
province.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister
Ignatius Olisemeka has called on the international community to
take up the responsibility for peace-keeping in Sierra Leone, The
Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks on Saturday evening at a civic
reception organized for him by retired Nigerian ambassadors in
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the international community should deploy a
multi- national force along the borders between Liberia and Sierra
Leone, or in the alternative assist the west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG with logistics.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka noted that the international community must play its
role in the peace-keeping mission in Sierra Lone under Chapter
Eight of the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair for the international community to tie Nigeria's
hands with sanctions and still expect it to keep peace on its
behalf, the minister complained.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Liberian leader Charles Taylor should be
held responsible for the "atrocities" he had been committing in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that "we are fashioning a policy to
contain him (Taylor). We are fashioning a policy to contain the
countries from where they (Liberia) get arms to kill innocent
peace-keeping troops in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Countries mandated by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to midwife peace in Sierra Leone are Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Togo and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka said it was unthinkable that Taylor would be
sabotaging peace efforts in Sierra Leone, considering the efforts,
energy, resources and lives expended in bringing peace to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"No one had imagined that Liberia will turn round to bite the
fingers that fed her," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "Taylor and Peace in Sierra Leone",
The Guardian newspaper said Monday that ECOWAS should summon, as a
matter of urgency, an extraordinary summit to deliberate upon the
Sierra Leone issue and pass a resolution on Taylor's "nefarious
role." The Organization of African Unity (OAU) should take a
similar step, the editorial added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
the incorporation of the Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guiding
ideology in the constitution is required because of prevailing
situations in the country.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the introduction of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
ruling the country by law, and the important role of a non-public
ownership economy in the Constitution of the People's Republic of
China is the common aspiration of the people from various ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks at a special meeting held recently to
solicit opinions of lawyers, economists and scholars on the
amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendments will be of great importance to holding
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhering to the
Communist Party of China (CPC)'s basic line in the primary stage
of socialism and development of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng outlined to the participants the CPC's proposal for
amendments to the constitution. He said the constitution, adopted
in 1982, is a good one in accordance with China's practical
situations, referring to the previous amendments in 1988 and 1993.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lions Prey on Famine Displaced People in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- People in southern Somalia are
not only dying for famine caused by droughts and civil war, but
wild beasts are also preying on them in the midst of their search
for food.
</P>
<P>
At least four people were killed and several others were
wounded when famine-displaced people were attacked by a pride of
lions at Didow village, some 50 kilometers northeast of the border
town of EI-Bardeh near Ethiopia in the seriously famine affected
region of Bakol Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ugas Abdi Ugas Hussein Ugas Khalif, a traditional leader of
EI-Bardeh town, Monday told this reporter via VHF radio that the
deceased include a woman and her infant daughter and two elderly
men.
</P>
<P>
The wounded are now being treated in the local treatment center
of the town, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the displaced people put the death number at more than
seven, saying that many more still remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
"The area around Didow village was long known as the den
haunted by lions, but since the civil war spread in the region, no
one had believed that they could still be there," said Abdufatah
Eydarus, another resident in EI-Bardeh.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families mainly women, children and elderly people
have reportedly left their villages in southern Somalia on their
way of crossing the border into Ethiopia in search of food.
</P>
<P>
There is serious food shortage throughout Somalia especially in
the southern, central and northeastern regions.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 people are said to be suffering from food
shortages, especially in the southern regions of the Horn of
Africa country.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peng said the CPC Central Committee attaches great
importance to the constitution's amendments and drew up the
proposals after collecting opinions from various sectors of
society.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC Central Committee has submitted the proposal to
the NPC Standing Committee for examination. As it has became a
bill of the NPC Standing Committee, it will be submitted to the
upcoming Second Session of the Ninth NPC for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting believed that the incorporation of
major issues of Deng Xiaoping Theory, ruling the country by law
and ensuring basic efficient economic and distribution systems in
the constitution indicates the CPC's further acknowledgment of the
primary stage of socialism and the building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The experts and scholars said the necessary amendments to the
constitution could mobilize and unite people of various ethnic
groups to push ahead the overall building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting put forward a number of suggestions
for amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng thanked the experts for their suggestions and said the
top legislative body will seriously consider them and adopt the
rational ones.
</P>
<P>
He explained that as amending the constitution is of historic
importance, the NPC will only amend the necessary points. He added
that anything not relevant or disputed will not be revised.

SHANGHAI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese journalist has ended
an expedition along the Yangtze River to investigate and report on
the causes and effects of last summer's severe flooding. He
arrived in Shanghai over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Luo Wanxiong, a journalist with the Guiyang Evening News in
southwest China's Guizhou Province, started his trip along the
Yangtze River on October 26 last year to take a personal look at
the results of the flooding in the river's middle and lower
reaches between last summer and autumn.
</P>
<P>
During his 96-day expedition, Luo crossed 11 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions -- Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan,
Yunnan, Chongqing, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and
Shanghai, traveling 7,500 km.
</P>
<P>
Luo is the first journalist to visit the total area affected
along the Yangtze River after the river's worst flooding in more
than four decades last year. Before that, he had walked along the
Yellow River, the second longest in China, on a similar mission.
Luo is the first Chinese who has walked along the two longest
rivers in China.
</P>
<P>
Luo will detail his latest experience in a book with more than
300,000 Chinese characters.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Urged to Take up Responsibility in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister
Ignatius Olisemeka has called on the international community to
take up the responsibility for peace-keeping in Sierra Leone, The
Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks on Saturday evening at a civic
reception organized for him by retired Nigerian ambassadors in
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the international community should deploy a
multi- national force along the borders between Liberia and Sierra
Leone, or in the alternative assist the west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG with logistics.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka noted that the international community must play its
role in the peace-keeping mission in Sierra Lone under Chapter
Eight of the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
It is unfair for the international community to tie Nigeria's
hands with sanctions and still expect it to keep peace on its
behalf, the minister complained.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Liberian leader Charles Taylor should be
held responsible for the "atrocities" he had been committing in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that "we are fashioning a policy to
contain him (Taylor). We are fashioning a policy to contain the
countries from where they (Liberia) get arms to kill innocent
peace-keeping troops in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Countries mandated by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to midwife peace in Sierra Leone are Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Togo and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka said it was unthinkable that Taylor would be
sabotaging peace efforts in Sierra Leone, considering the efforts,
energy, resources and lives expended in bringing peace to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"No one had imagined that Liberia will turn round to bite the
fingers that fed her," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "Taylor and Peace in Sierra Leone",
The Guardian newspaper said Monday that ECOWAS should summon, as a
matter of urgency, an extraordinary summit to deliberate upon the
Sierra Leone issue and pass a resolution on Taylor's "nefarious
role." The Organization of African Unity (OAU) should take a
similar step, the editorial added.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Jiang Zemin's Eight-point Proposal on Reunification Marked in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Monday expressed the hope
that more Taiwan compatriots will come to Hong Kong to see its
actual situation in implementing the principle of "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" with a high-degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
This will help them get a deep and specific understanding of the
rich connotation of "one country, two systems", Jiang said at a
forum here to mark the fourth anniversary of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's speech on the reunification of the motherland and
the 20th anniversary of the publication of the Message to Taiwan
Compatriots by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the unprecedented and creative practice of "
one country, two systems" in Hong Kong has won widespread acclaim
from the international community.
</P>
<P>
This has set an example for the Taiwan compatriots to be the
masters of their own destiny after the country's reunification and
presented a bright future for them to share, along with the
Chinese mainland people and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots after
the reunification, the dignity and honor attained by the great
motherland internationally, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 well-known people from all sectors of society in
Hong Kong attended the forum. Among them were Henry Fok Ying-tung,
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), along with Ulan Mulun
and Wang Fengchao, deputy directors of the Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Zou Zhekai, deputy director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch, presided over the forum.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Fok said that it is the trend of the
times to develop a close economic relationship between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits and no one can stop them from doing so.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and the mainland are as close as flesh and
blood, he said: "We all belong to the Chinese nation and our
cultural tradition, moral concepts, ways of life and modes of
thinking all originate from the vast land of the Chinese nation".
</P>
<P>
No force can change the ties of blood between the people of
both sides and their patriarchal clan systems, feelings and
pursuits cemented through several thousand years of history, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities to set the national interests
above everything else and bury old grudges so as to accomplish a
smooth reunification, achieve the high aims of re-vitalizing the
Chinese nation, and try to bring credit to our ancestors and
benefits to future generations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu's remarks at the forum also focused on the
significance of Jiang Zemin's speech on reunification and the Hong
Kong-Taiwan relationship as well as the duties and obligations
that the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch has in the new period.
</P>
<P>
Others who addressed the forum included representatives from
the CPPCC National Committee, and sectors of the press, education
and enterprises as well as organizations of trade unions, women
and youth.
</P>
<P>
They all appealed to the Taiwan authorities to comply with the
national interests, proceed from the interests of the Taiwan
compatriots, abandon and stop creating "two Chinas", "one China
and one Taiwan". They also condemned the policy of restraining
Taiwan's investment in the mainland and other policies or
activities harmful to the reunification and the interests of the
two sides across the Taiwan Straits so as to realize direct links
of postal, air and shipping services and trade at an early date.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the wish to speed up the process of
political and economic dialogues between the two sides and realize
the reunification through political talks under the one China
principle.

<HEADLINE> Shaky Cease-fire Observed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Government troops and Muslim
rebels Monday observed a shaky cease-fire in Maguindanao, the
southern Philippines, with isolated clashes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency cited a military report as
saying 20 rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under
cover of darkness harassed a detachment of the 37th Marine Corps
in Talayan town at dawn Monday.
</P>
<P>
The marines returned fire with automatic weapons, forcing the
rebels to withdraw after a 30-minute gun battle. But two
government soldiers were wounded in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado described the clash as the
only violation of the two-day-old cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"There were no mortar shellings and things have normalized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado expressed the hope that the cease-fire would hold.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF will resume peace negotiations in
Cotabato City on February 8. The peace talks will last for three
days.
</P>
<P>
During the past three weeks, government and MILF forces clashed
in southern Mindanao, killing more than 30 people and wounding
dozens of others from both sides. The warring parties reached the
cease-fire last Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Premier of S. Africa's KwaZulu-Natal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- KwaZulu-Natal Premier Ben
Ngubane has been removed from office, South African media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released Sunday, Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Ngubane said that the
removal was made because of poor matric results in the province.
</P>
<P>
"As premier of the province, Dr B.S. Ngubane carries the final
responsibility for the delivery of essential services by the
KwaZulu-Natal government," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"While recognizing that the KwaZulu-Natal government and its
leadership have tried their best to make the province's education
system a successful one, it is clear that this year's matric
results have shown that even their best was objectively not good
enough," it added.
</P>
<P>
The IFP is the ruling party in KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
Provincial education minister Vincent Zulu was also fired.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that South African Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology, Lionel Mtshali, would take over
as KwaZulu-Natal Premier.
</P>
<P>
However, there was speculation that Ngubane would take over
Mtshali's national portfolio, which he held before becoming
KwaZulu-Natal Finance Minister and later Premier.
</P>
<P>
Business Day newspaper quoted sources as saying that the
African National Congress (ANC) top brass was dissatisfied with
Mtshali who, apart from a public spat with his director-general
Roger Jardine, was involved in a row with the United States
government.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi was apparently unhappy with Ngubane's performance
after a dispute concerning casino licenses, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement denied the allegations that Ngubane was
removed because of his handling of gambling in the province.
</P>
<P>
It said Ngubane would sort out this problem before leaving the
province.

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Impressive Growth in Housing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain a rational
and stable growth in real estate development and investment this
year, with housing construction continuing to expand along with
the revival of the real estate market, said a senior official here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to Song Chunhua, vice-minister of construction, the
implementation of the housing reform will effectively boost the
country's housing markets.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate individual spending on housing, the commercial
banks will take steps to introduce mortgages and help potential
buyers by perfecting the housing fund-raising system.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China's housing sector has helped spur
on the country's economic development and is rapidly becoming a
major focus in consumer spending. China made remarkable progress
during 1998 by completing housing construction covering 350
million sq.m.,up 10 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country witnessed a 56 percent increase in
housing sold last year, with a record 62 percent increase in sales.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plummet on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed lower on
Singapore Stock Market Monday as the continued volatility and fear
of weaker corporate earnings dragged down the shares.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) declined by 21.27
points to 1,406.87 in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
The total volume was 148.14 million units valued at 267.5
million Singapore dollars (about 158.07 million U.S. dollars).
Falls edged out rises nearly 10 times by 249 to 26 while 146
shares remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
ST Engg topped the actives chart of the day with a turnover of
19.75 million shares. SemCorp was the second most heavily traded
share with a turnover of 8.8 million units. DBS Land was next with
a volume of 4.36 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH 100 headed the ascent of the day with a 30-cent rise to
finish at 19.4 Singapore dollars. It was followed by NatElec that
edged up 15 cents to close at 5.2 Singapore dollars. BATS picked
up 10 cents to end at 4.2 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, multi-media peripherals maker Creative 50
dented the STI as it plunged 280 cents to 22.5 Singapore dollars
after a profit warning for the third quarter. DBS and F &AMP; N
dropped 30 cents and ended at 7.95 and 5.6 Singapore dollars
respectively. SIA retreated 25 cents and closed at 6.85 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the market was volatile with weak underlying
sentiment and thin trading volume, tracking Dow closely and having
no direction of its own.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also attributed Monday's plunge to fears of weaker
corporate earnings in this reporting season.
</P>
<P>
Management officials said the sales during the third quarter
were likely to be sluggish due to the ongoing turmoil in Asia and
Latin America and structural changes.

<HEADLINE> Pump Supplier to Yellow River Diversion Project Chosen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A conglomerate formed by three
Japanese companies has been chosen by China's Wanjiazhai Water
Diversion project developer to be its pump supplier following an
international tender.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed mainly to draw water from the Yellow
River, China's second longest, to north China's water-deficient
province of Shanxi, a major coal reserve area. The project will be
constructed in two stages.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will divert water from the Yellow River to
Taiyuan, the provincial capital. It has an investment of more than
12 billion yuan, of which 400 million U.S. dollars were provided
by the World Bank. The second phase will extend the water channel
from Taiyuan to Datong and Shuozhou.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo Yuhuai, head of the project, five pump
stations will be constructed during the first-phase construction,
which will need 15 vertical centrifugal pumps featuring large flow
capacities, high lifts and other supporting equipment.
</P>
<P>
Five organizations competed in the public bidding and
eventually the conglomerate of the Marubeni Corporation, Ebara
Corporation and Toshiba Corporation won and signed a contract with
the project developer recently, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
The project developer had invited tenders from foreign
construction firms for five other civil engineering works.
Contractors for three of the five works have been chosen and work
has been in progress for 16 months. The job of finding the best
contractors for constructing the two other works is still ongoing.
</P>
<P>
An important part of the Wanjiazhai project, the dam, was
finished and started to generate electricity last October. Work on
the 6-billion-yuan dam began in 1993. It is one of eight power
stations on the Yellow River and is expected to provide 1.2
billion cu.m. of water for Shanxi Province; 200 million cu.m. for
Inner Mongolia, and 2.75 billion kwh of electricity to north China,
annually

<P>
Sources from the China Youth Development Foundation disclosed
that there will be no further Hope Project scholarship recipients
after the current Hope Primary School students graduate.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation is now aiming at higher levels although the
former Hope Project students still have access to scholarships if
they want to continue their high school, university and post-
graduate education.
</P>
<P>
An official from the foundation added: "But only the top 400
outstanding students, who have passed the Hope Project Star
appraisal made every year, will get the scholarships, and only
twenty model Hope Primary schools will receive financial support."
</P>
<P>
"The Hope Project hasn't come to an end, and still needs
financial support from all the sectors of society," stressed Xu
Yongguang, Secretary General of the China Youth Development
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's most influential public welfare undertakings
in the 1990s, the Hope Project has to change its methods of making
donations in accordance with the Chinese government's statement
that by 2000, China will eliminate poverty and make widespread
nine-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Primer Li Lanqing said that China's educational system
should not be dependent on the Hope Project, but on the Chinese
Government.

<HEADLINE> Govt's Major Task to Improve People's Living: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said that the major task of the government is to improve
the standard of people's living when he launched a heifer project
in Mbarara district in southwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the people at the Kashongi sub county headquarters
Sunday, Museveni called on local people to focus on raising
homestead incomes in order to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper Monday quoted the president as saying
that his government will repair and make feeder roads for easy
transportation of produce to markets.
</P>
<P>
The project was launched with 10 million Shillings (10 million
U.S. Dollars) which he said will operate as a revolving fund so
that each home in the sub county eventually obtains a heifer from
the scheme.
</P>
<P>
A similar project, which he introduced in neighboring Ntungamo
district two years ago with 20 in-calf heifers, had provided a
heifer each for 78 homes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told the gathering that the government can now extend
some modest financial assistance for such projects, a result of
the stable economic foundation the government has put in place.

Analysts acknowledge that the education resources allocated by
the government is far from enough, even though the education
budget had increased from 70 billion yuan in 1991 to 250 billion
yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Xu pointed out that the Hope Project, by encouraging non-
government donations to develop education, raised a 1.6 billion
yuan fund, helped over two million dropout children, and
established over 6,000 Hope primary schools, since it started
operation in October, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The China Youth Development Foundation and all provincial level
youth development foundations will continue to raise non-
government funds for advanced programs under the Hope Project and
for the establishment of more Hope primary schools.
</P>
<P>
The foundation will no longer run major campaigns seeking
donations to the Hope Project, but will help to establish direct
contact between the dropout children and donors.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that this new system will help increase the
Hope Project management efficiency, and will better encourage
people to support the Hope Project and the dropout children in
poverty-stricken areas.

HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Enzhu, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said here Monday that after
Hong Kong's return to China, the Hong Kong-Taiwan relationship has
become a special component of cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at a forum here to mark the fourth
anniversary of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech on the
reunification of the motherland and the 20th anniversary of the
publication of the Message to Taiwan Compatriots by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Hong Kong-Taiwan relationship has maintained a
good momentum of development, Jiang said that the government of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has taken
positive measures for the promotion of Hong Kong-Taiwan personnel
contacts and various kinds of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has formulated the relevant principles
and policies which give support and encouragement to the SAR to
continuously maintain and boost its non-governmental exchanges and
cooperation with Taiwan in the economy, culture, science and
technology, as well as personnel contacts based on the one China
principle.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan compatriots and various kinds of enterprises are
welcome and encouraged to come to Hong Kong for investment, trade
and for conducting other industrial and commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
This is of extremely positive significance to facilitating
economic prosperity between Hong Kong and Taiwan and pushing ahead

It will further enhance its links with different sectors in
Hong Kong, widely listening to opinions and suggestions raised by
the people from all walks of life including the Taiwan compatriots
residing in Hong Kong on the development of cross-straits
relations and the promotion of the peaceful reunification, and
doing more work for the smooth development of the Hong Kong-Taiwan
relations and cross-straits relations as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch is willing to provide
assistance for those Taiwan compatriots who come to Hong Kong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that the Taiwan compatriots residing
in Hong Kong will live and work in peace and contentment and score
successes in their business so as to promote Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability and the sound growth of the Hong Kong-
Taiwan relations together with the Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the existing Taiwan organizations stationed in
Hong Kong and their staff members should strictly abide by the
Basic Law and the law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They should neither run counter to the one China principle, nor
conduct activities harmful to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability
and inconsistent with the nature of the registration.
</P>
<P>
They are encouraged and welcome to contribute to maintaining
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, developing Hong Kong-Taiwan
relations and cross-straits relations and promoting the
reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, Jiang said that the publication of the Message to
Taiwan Compatriots by the NPC Standing Committee on January 1,
1979, marked the major readjustment and development of the
policies concerning Taiwan by the Chinese Communist Party and the
Central Government.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), he said, the
strategic concept of "peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems" set forth by the late Deng Xiaoping has been gradually
established in the process of practice, exerting a great influence
on cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the important speech issued by Jiang Zemin on
January 30, 1995, in view of the new situation of cross-straits
relations in the 1990s as a pragmatic document for the settlement
of the Taiwan question during the new period.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng's basic ideology on solving the Taiwan question
has been applied to and developed in Jiang's speech, which is of
great significance and has far reaching influence.
</P>
<P>
The realization of the reunification in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" will fully show the
respect for history and reality and consideration for all sides'
interests, and surely bring about the real blend of the interests
of the whole nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the Hong Kong compatriots and the Taiwan
compatriots residing in Hong Kong to respond to President Jiang's
call to "hold high the great banner of patriotism, uphold
reunification, oppose secession, spare no effort to promote the
expansion of relations between the two sides and facilitate the
accomplishment of the reunification of the motherland".

CHENGDU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite the negative impact of
the Asian financial crisis, southwest China's Sichuan Province
achieved 9.1 percent economic growth last year, a 1.3 percentage
point higher than the nation's average.
</P>

Local officials attributed the growth to Sichuan's active work
in attracting foreign investment, its tapping of markets in Europe,
North America and Africa, and the restructuring of its state-owned
enterprises.
</P>

Last year, Sichuan approved 233 joint ventures and foreign-
funded businesses, which involved 1.58 billion US dollars of
contracting investment and 1.7 billion US dollars of utilized
investment, an increase of 18 percent and 103 percent,
respectively, from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Promote Pork Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
announced Monday that it will provide 6.2 million Australian
dollars (3.9 million U.S. dollars) in grants to promote pork
exports and a review of quarantine procedures on pork imports.
</P>
<P>
Pork Council of Australia, which has led a campaign against the
government, praised the announcement made by Agriculture Minister
Mark Vaile.
</P>
<P>
Vaile said in a statement that 3.5 million Australian dollars
(2.2 million U.S. dollars) would be spent on improving the
international competitiveness and export performance of
Australia's pork export industry.
</P>
<P>
Another 2.7 million Australian dollars (1.7 million U.S.
dollars) will be spent on establishing an export marketing group
to provide new and existing exporters with information and
assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government's restructuring package for Australia's pork
industry is not only providing assistance for those most in need,
but is also helping encourage a far stronger and more
internationally competitive industry," Vaile said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised an independent audit of the Australian
Quarantine and Inspection Service's controls on imported, uncooked
pork.
</P>
<P>
Pork Council President Peter Brechin said the announcements was
long overdue, but very welcome. "This announcement will be an
important part of the restructuring process. The export marketing
programs are particularly innovative."
</P>
<P>
Australia's pork industry has been struggling with low prices
although recent export breakthroughs to Japan have helped
stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry is still pushing for a temporary freeze
on imports to give local producers some breathing space.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar rose
Monday by nearly one-third of a U.S. cent as commodity prices
strengthened and market players focused on a 1.6 billion
Australian dollar (1 billion U.S. dollars) overseas purchase of a
Victorian gas utility.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 63.12 U.S. cents, from 62.82 at
Friday's close, after marking a 63.09 to 63.22 band in local
dealings.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust Australia foreign exchange manager Angelo Gangemi
said the market had focused on the purchase of one of Victoria's
four major gas businesses for 1.617 billion Australian dollars by
Texas Utilities.
</P>
<P>
"If we see this sort of money invested in Australia then there
will be demand for the Aussie. Investors have to bring it into the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also helped by higher prices for
commodities, Gangemi said.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index closed in New York on
Friday at 189.74, up 0.42. The CRB is an index of 17 U.S. futures
markets and although not weighted to Australia's exports, traders
follow it as an indicator for the commodity price-sensitive
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The CRB index was up a little so we expect the currency to
show a little more strength," Gangemi said.
</P>
<P>
Gold was also stronger, with COMEX gold for current delivery
closing up 1.5 at 286.3 U.S. dollars Friday in New York.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Denies Presidential Ambition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has reiterated his denial that he would take part in the
presidential race in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the NTV Itogi program Sunday night,
Primakov said his recent proposal on stability in society to the
speakers of the State Duma and the Federation Council was not in
any way linked to an intention to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal, under which President Boris Yeltsin
would give up his powers to dismiss parliament until the end of
the year and the parliament would stop impeachment proceedings
against the president, was only aimed at achieving "maximum accord
in society."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said "the hullabaloo raised in media" over his
alleged presidential ambition was "an attempt to drive a wedge
between the government and parliament."
</P>
<P>
"To think that I want to consolidate my positions in order to
run in the presidential race is ludicrous," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it was "very pleasant" for him that part of
the population regards him as a possible candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
"But I would not like to take part in the presidential race,"
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov has been seen as the most popular Russian politician
in recent public opinion polls.

<HEADLINE> UAE's Environment Day to Focus on Marine Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will celebrate the Second National Environment Day on
February 4 under the theme "Together to Preserve Our Marine
Environment."
</P>
<P>
Government and private establishments in the different emirates
in the UAE will celebrate the event by organizing environmental
activities targeting all members of society, Mohammed Abdul
Rahman Al Habbai, General Coordinator of the National Environment
Day, said on Sunday in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
He said the UAE was concerned about protecting the environment
from pollution. One of the most important objectives of the
Environment Day is to protect the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Enironment Authority (FEA) had chosen the theme of
marine environment because of waste from ships, the increase of
industrial establishments along the coastline in the region,
extensive fishing, the Gulf War in 1991 and the resulting oil
pollution, and the increase of oil field work, he said.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to prevent marine, land and air pollution, the
UAE had in recent years, banned the transfer of oil by
non-specialized marine facilities and the disposal of waste in the
sea, and issued regulations for fishing and quarantine areas.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is in the process of issuing a law for environment
protection to limit all types of pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities, women's societies, hotels, private companies
and government and semi-government establishments will organize
activities, including exhibitions, lectures, competitions, clean-
up of beaches, and children's TV programs, which will all convey
the theme of the day, he said.

<P>
China introduced its law on environmental protection in 1979,
and stipulated that environmental protection is a basic national
policy at the second national conference on the subject in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that taking care of natural resources and the
environment has become an important factor in relation to the
economic growth and social progress of the country.
</P>
<P>
The severe floods along the Yangtze River last summer struck
alarm bells for ecological protection, Li said, reminding readers
that a sustainable development strategy is a requirement of the
law related to economic growth as well as the natural environment,
and more important, is also a practical requirement for boosting
China's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the environment can never be sacrificed in
favor of economic growth, anywhere and at any time, and that
officials at all levels must carry out to the letter the measures
necessary for improving the environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law in this regard must be strengthened to
coordinate the development of the population and the economy in
tandem with protecting natural resources and the environment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged relevant departments to step up their efforts to
increase the awareness of environmental protection among the
people, especially key officials, in order to make this basic
national policy known across the country.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Territory Exclusion From Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Monday that he is willing to talk with Muslim
rebel leaders to move the peace process forward only if the issue
of territorial integrity is excluded from their discussions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Estrada expressed his willingness to meet
top leaders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), including
its chairman, Hashim Salamat, as long as they do not bring up the
territorial integrity issue as it "can not be compromised to
anyone."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said that when he visits Mindanao in late
February, he may meet leaders of the 12,000-strong MILF, which is
fighting for an independent state in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to meet with them, so long as they do not raise
the issues of territorial integrity and our constitution," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that upon his orders, the police and military have
continued without letup their campaign to go after lawless
elements in the south.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue violating our laws, then we will really apply
the full force of the law against these violators," he said.
</P>
<P>
After fighting for about three weeks in southern Mindanao, the
government and the rebel group reached a new cease-fire last
Wednesday and agreed to start peace talks later this week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientific Circles Sign Ethics Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientific circles
signed a pact here today to ban the plagiarizing of papers and
protect intellectual rights and ethics.
</P>
<P>
A total of 102 scientific societies and 231 academic journals
under the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST),
China's largest scientific organization, promised as signatories
to the pact to boycott activities such as plagiarism, fraud and
altering the records of experiments.
</P>
<P>
The scientific journals will refuse to publish the papers of
those who violate the rules and will mercilessly -- and publicly --
criticize their actions.
</P>
<P>
The essence of science is to seek truth, and any activities
undermining scientific disciplines are not permitted, said Zhang
Yutai, vice-president of CAST.
</P>
<P>
"Such known plagiarizing of papers by returning overseas
scientists should have been exposed and criticized before," said
Zou Chenglu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "
Creating a good scientific atmosphere in China is as important as
improving the working and living conditions in order to attract
back overseas Chinese scientists."
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement should apply not only to academic
societies and journals but to all Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Fan Wenhai, editor of "Biology Bulletin", said that specific
regulations have yet to be drawn up to enforce the pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua)-- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with Gutenberg Martinez, president of the
Chilean Chamber of Deputies, at the Great Hall of the People here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that although China and Chile are geographically far
apart, and different in cultural backgrounds and social systems,
they both face the task of developing their economies and
upgrading their people's living standards, and thus needed a
peaceful and stable external environment.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enjoyed great advantages in developing
bilateral cooperation, Li said, citing the same or similar views
they have on many important international issues, and how their
economies are complementary.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that Martinez' current visit will
further promote mutual communication.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the guest, Li also explained the function of
the CPPCC, China's non-state-owned economy, and the country's
opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Martinez said Chile highly appreciates China's active role in
international affairs, and is willing to join with China to
continue pushing forward bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of his present visit is to reinforce
bilateral communication in the legislative sphere and seek new
channels for economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic globalization, Martinez pointed out
that developing countries should try to seek benefits and avoid
disadvantages during the process, stressing that globalization
should benefit all countries, not just some.

<HEADLINE> Church of Uganda to Stay Neutral in referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Church of Uganda has said that
it will not take sides in the upcoming referendum on the political
system.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Livingstone Nkoyooyo made the remarks Sunday when
addressing Christians at a diocese Cathedral in Masaka in southern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper Monday quoted the archbishop as saying
that the multipartyists and the supporters of the ruling National
Resistance Movement are friends of the Church and therefore it is
better for the Church to be neutral on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, he appealed to the government to give both the
Movement and the political parties equal opportunities to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Church leaders were urged to unite the people because they
belong to different ethnic origins, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the position taken by Nkoyooyo, the Catholic
Archbishop Emmanuel Cardinal Wamala has questioned the usefulness
of a referendum in bringing about harmony and reconciliation among
the people.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has said on several occasions
that the referendum, which will decide on the political system of
the east African country, will be held as scheduled and nobody can
stop it.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is provided for in the Constitution and Ugandans
will decide in 2000 whether to continue with the Movement system
of governance or allow political parties to come back.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Speed up Transit Cargo Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan port authority has
taken a number measures to speed up the import and export transit
cargo movement destined for neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The measures include preferential treatment to importers and
clearing agents, especially from Uganda and Rwanda, at the port of
Mombasa, the East African weekly newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jointly initiated by the Kenya Ports Authority, the Kenya
Revenue Authority and the Kenya Railways Corporation, the measures
also include improved security of transit goods and extensive
rehabilitation and modernization of equipment at Mombasa Port.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper published in three east African
countries, verification procedures on transit cargo have been
reduced and an area has been set aside at the Mombasa container
terminal for storing transit cargo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, transit vehicles are issued with motor vehicle
inspection reports to prevent delays caused by motor vehicle
inspections on the highways.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are all intended to ensure smooth movement of
transit cargo," said Samuel Njoroge, Chairman of the Kenya
International Freight and Warehousing Association.
</P>
<P>
However, Ugandan clearing agents have called for the abolition
of the convey system, saying that it causes unnecessary delays of
cargo shipment.

<HEADLINE> China Spends More on Residential Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China increased its investment
in residential buildings by nearly 30 percent last year in a bid
to improve the people's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that
such investment in the first 11 months of last year reached 152
billion yuan (18.4 billion U.S. dollars), a growth of 29.2 percent
over the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
China's total investment in real estate development between
January and November last year amounted to 249 billion yuan (30
billion dollars), up 18.3 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
With the boom in housing construction, Chinese building
materials factories produced 451.7 million tons of cement and 148.
6 million weight cases of plate glass in the 11-month period, a
rise of six percent and 8.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
As one of the countermeasures to boost demand in the home
market facing the continuous impact of the ongoing Asian crisis,
the Chinese government has moved to increase investment in the
construction of infrastructure, including residential housing and
related projects, across the country.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Men's Biathlon Gold at Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>

<P>
YONGYPONG, South Korea, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Army
man Zhang Qing Monday surpised the event's powerhouse Kazakhstan
and himself by taking the gold medal in the men's 20 kilometer
biathlon on the second day of the Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Zhang, dual gold medalists at the National
Winter Games last month, missed three targets but his fast skiing
time of 59 minutes 53.2 seconds paced him to China's second gold
at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Zhang posted a total time of one hour two minutes and 53.3 seco
nds to Dmitriy Pozonyakov's 1:03:01 and his Kazakhstan compatriot
Dmirtriy Pantov's 1:03:24.8.
</P>
<P>
Liu Heng, head coach of the China's biathlon team, said they
hadn't expected Zhang would snatch the gold from Kazaksatan, who
sent their best biathlon athletes here to defend four titles they
claimed three years ago in the Harbin Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"None of us expected Zhang to win the gold before the
competition," Liu said. "Normally he wasn't as strong as some
first class skiers from Kazakhstan and Japan, but he had an
excellent day."
</P>
<P>
Japan only fielded a second-string team here as their top
skiers are taking part in the Alpine Skiing World Championships
in Colorado, the United States this week.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sharif Government Acts to Quell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government led
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has taken the bold decision of
establishing military courts all over the country in a bid to stem
spiraling terrorism.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Pakistan's history that an elected
government has invoked Article 245 of the Pakistan Constitution
(that provides for the setting up of military courts) in the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government first set up military courts in southern
Sindh Province on November 20 last year after dismissing the
provincial government and imposing direct federal rule to arrest
ethnic, political and factional violence in the provincial capital
of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who himself escaped an attempt on his life early
January, made the announcement for setting up military courts
throughout the country in Lahore last Saturday, days before the
apex court was to hear a set of petitions challenging the setting
up of these courts in Sindh.
</P>
<P>
Speedy justice through military courts across the country and
deweaponization of society have been spelled out by the prime
minister as the immediate priorities of his government which came
to power in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the military courts, to start
functioning soon across the country, will deal with an "iron hand"
with criminals involved in heinous crimes and "the government will
live up to the aspirations of the downtrodden at all costs."
</P>
<P>
Sharif believed that the law and order situation in Sindh,
especially in the provincial capital of Karachi, has improved to a
certain extent since the establishment of military courts there.
</P>
<P>
"We have greatly been encouraged by the experience in Karachi
and now we intend to establish military courts all over the
country to ensure that fair and prompt justice is dispensed to the
people," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision, however, has drawn harsh criticism
from the main opposition party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP),
led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said promulgation of the ordinance to set
up military courts throughout the country is intended to strike
terror to silence dissent and send a signal to the Supreme Court
on the eve of hearings in the historic case.
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance was promulgated in spite of the fact that the
Supreme Court had already stayed execution of death sentences
awarded by the military courts in Karachi and will take up the
case of legality of these courts from Monday," Benazir said in a
statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She also said this has been done despite the apex court's
ruling in the past that military courts could not be established
under the constitution to try ordinary civilians.
</P>
<P>
Syed Talat Hussain, a leading columnist, said in his article,
"the presence of the military courts, or any other type of special
courts established to partake the functions of the normal judicial
system had begun to hit at the base of whole judicial order."
</P>
<P>
Rashed Rahman, another columnist, was of the view that "lacking
the vision and managerial ability to bring in the necessary
reforms to improve and change the existing systems and make them
efficacious, the government is inclined impatiently to bypass them
with parallel dispensions."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif, however, has made it clear that the
establishment of military courts is not an effort to set up a
"parallel judicial system."
</P>
<P>
The government of the Pakistan Muslim League always holds the
judiciary in high esteem and will continue to respect in future,
Sharif said, adding that the government's decision to set up
military courts across the country was taken in the broader
perspective of the overall law and order situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government officials justify the setting up of
military courts on the plea that in the exceptional circumstances,
such as those prevailing in Karachi, the normal system of justice
cannot deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
They quoted some media reports as saying the unabated sectarian
killings claimed lives of some 600 people in 1998 alone in the
country's most populous and politically influential Punjab
Province.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the decision to set up military courts in all
provinces represented the final phase of the government's "war
against terrorism and lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
An all-out campaign would also be launched to seize illegal
arms circulating in the country, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts noted that so far the government's endeavor
to combat terrorism through police and rangers has not achieved
satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
In such a situation, the establishment of military courts
throughout the country has added to the challenges confronting the
government at critical juncture in the nation's history, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Developing States Should Not Rely on Foreign Aid: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has said that people in developing countries
should not rely on foreign aid if they want to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign aid was responsible for decreasing morale and
self-initiatives in developing countries," the ILO representative
in East Africa, Ali Ibrahim, said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The African, a Dar es Salaam-based newspaper, Monday quoted the
ILO official as saying that over-dependence on foreign aid would
only aggravate the poverty problem.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who was touring Kisarawe District in east Tanzania's
Coast Region during the weekend, said that it was high time
developing countries devised means to eradicate poverty motivating
local manpower and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The ILO representative, accompanied by Tanzanian Minister of
Labor and Youth Development, Paul Kimiti, visited an agricultural
project developed by retired soldiers and retrenched civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
Burdened with an external debt of some eight billion U.S.
Dollars, Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world,
with its gross national product (GNP) per capita less than 200
U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim urged the Tanzanians to rekindle self-reliance spirit
and consider foreign aid only as complementary in their national
development, otherwise the country is not likely to make much
progress.

<HEADLINE> China Celebrating Centenary of Discovery of Earliest Character </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China will celebrate the 100th
anniversary of the discovery of the earliest use of characters as
inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences say
that they will spend four years translating inscriptions on some
500 pieces of bones and shells that were found recently. Since
1991, archeologists have unearthed 1,583 pieces of bones and
shells during the excavation of a vault in central China, which
have been identified as the most complete examples of ancient
pictographs.
</P>
<P>
They will provide information about divination and clan life,
says Cao Dingyun, who is in charge of the research.
</P>
<P>
The first bones and tortoise shells with strange character
inscriptions were discovered in 1899 in a village in Hunan
province, where the capital of the Shang dynasty (16th-11th
century B.C.) was located. More than 150,000 pieces have been
unearthed by now, but many of the inscriptions still can not be

<HEADLINE> Official Says No Proof on Marcos Gold Hoard in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it has yet to come up with concrete proof on reports
about the presence of gold allegedly stashed away by the late
President Ferdinand Marcos in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Monday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said reports on the alleged Marcos gold hoard in
the United States have been "coming out every two years or so for
the last 12 years."
</P>
<P>
"We have been looking into that long ago, but we have not come
up with anything solid so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora was reacting to a claim over the weekend by a prominent
businessman that there is some 35 billion U.S. dollars worth of
Marcos gold in the U.S. treasury.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. Embassy has been checking the claim, but has
so far turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said the government is still waiting for the Marcos
family to appoint a single representative from their side before
the government reopens talks on the recovery of their assets.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Apartment Block Fire Kills Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) - Four people were killed in a
fire this morning in the Chinese capital, police sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out around 5:40 am in a four-story residential
complex in the Xibianmen area in downtown Beijing, and was
extinguished by 10:00 am.
</P>
<P>
The four people were too severely burnt to be identified but
police said that they include one child, one man and two women.
They are not necessarily from one family, said police, who based
this information on where their bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
The entire fourth floor was destroyed despite the efforts of
eight fire-fighting units and 42 fire trucks in extinguishing the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still being investigated but police
believe that it might have been faulty electrical wiring or a
cooker.
</P>
<P>
Unlike modern buildings, the old style apartment block which
was put to use in 1955 with wooden frames which make them
vulnerable to fires.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 80 families living in the building are employed by
the Great Wall Optics Apparatus Plant.
</P>
<P>
The local government has set up four teams to investigate the
incident and make arrangements for the victims, an official said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,763 fires were reported in Beijing in 1998,
killing 40 people, injuring 101 and resulting in economic losses
of more than 40 million yuan (about five million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Problems with electrical home appliances are blamed as the
biggest cause of the fires.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Uneasy Over Internet Smut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bahraini government is
increasingly concerned over the devastating impact on children of
easy access to pornographic materials on the Internet, the Gulf
News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The issue has attracted much attention from the Education
Ministry, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays children and adolescents get access to pornographic
materials, which had remained out of their reach, until the
Internet came on the scene, a study on the issue said.
</P>
<P>
Now children mature at a very early age and one of the most
striking examples of this trend is a 13-year-old boy who said he
preferred to stay at home and watch sex materials on the Internet
when asked why he didn't go out with his friends.
</P>
<P>
It is not easy to address the issue of pornography among
students in a conservative, Islamic and eastern society of
Bahrain, especially when sex-related materials on television
programs such as items on AIDS and other sexually-transmitted
diseases are taken into account, the study said.
</P>
<P>
One headmaster said that when teenagers watch pornographic
films they find themselves face to face with a phenomenon which
"they cannot turn into reality for themselves." So they become
frustrated and isolate themselves from others.

<HEADLINE> Staple Food Shortage Continues in Harare's Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of maize meal, the
country's staple food, continued in most suburbs of Harare,
Zimbabwe's capital Sunday with shop owners saying they had not
received any deliveries from the milling companies since last
week.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald reported Monday that there were long queues at
the few shops with supplies as well as at milling companies which
were selling old stock.
</P>
<P>
Residents could be seen battling to buy the available packs of
roller- meal, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The shortage is being attributed by millers to inadequate
deliveries of grain from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB).
</P>
<P>
The GMB has repeatedly assured the nation that there is enough
maize in the southern African country to last until the next
harvest but there have been problems with the distribution which
had been blamed on the National Railways of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
While the slow distribution of maize could be a factor, blame
is also being partly laid on the millers who are alleged to be
reluctant to mill or make any special efforts to overcome slow
deliveries in an effort to force the government to increase maize
meal prices.
</P>
<P>
The Herald also said the age-old adage that "a hungry man is an
 angry man" proved true recently when a hungry customer allegedly
bit the thumb of a Harare food outlet manager.

<HEADLINE> MKO Claims Responsibility for Blasts in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's outlawed Mujahideen
Khalq Organization (MKO) has claimed responsibility for a series
of explosions in northern Tehran on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the Islamic Republic News Agency on
Monday morning that the MKO claimed its agents had attacked the
building of Iranian Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts occurred at the crossing of Shahid Hemmat
highway and Shahid Araqi highway in the north of the capital,
breaking windowpanes of nearby houses and damaged several cars.
</P>
<P>
The source said that through this futile attempt, the MKO tried
to please the global arrogance (the United States) on the eve of
the 20th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the Islamic Revolution ended the rein of the late shah
over Iran, and brought the Islamic clerics to power.
</P>
<P>
The source said the MKO had launched the attack in the vain
hope that they would be able to hit the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was one of the main political groups which had been
fighting against and toppled the shah's regime. But it was banned
in 1981 following its political disputes with the mullahs in power.
</P>
<P>
Based in Iraq, the MKO launched a slew of military attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country, particularly
during the 10-Day Dawn period (February 1-10) each year marking
the victory of the Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Base Lending Rates to Drop to 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRONI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's base lending rates are
expected to drop to 15 percent, the lowest in 13 years, as Kenyan
commercial banks respond to a free-fall in treasury bills, the
East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The lower interest rates will encourage borrowers, particularly
those seeking overdraft facilities to provide working capital and
go for credit, the paper said, adding that the result would be
higher economic growth in all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The T-bills rate hit an all-time low of 9.9 percent at last
Thursday's auction, down from 10.5 percent the previous week. The
rate last recorded 9.9 percent in 1981 and was 26.4 percent last
May.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank of Kenya was the first to announce a reduction of
its base lending rate from19 percent to 17 percent effective on
January 1, 1999, and Standard Chartered Bank followed suit two
weeks later with a similar reduction.
</P>
<P>
The two banks are followed by the Commercial Bank of Africa
whose base leading rate is 18 percent. The National Bank of Kenya
announced last week that it had reduced its base leading rate to
19 percent from February 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the base lending rates which the four major banks
compete fiercely, the rates paid to savers vary widely from bank
to bank.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts have urged the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to
find ways to prevailing on commercial banks to reduce the large
margin between the interest rate they pay for the deposits and the
prime rates they charge the customers.
</P>
<P>
But the CBK argued that its hands are tied because the country
is pursuing a liberalized economy, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Bus Crash Claims 34 Lives in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four people were
killed when a bus plunged into a river-bed on the N3 highway in
the area between Villiers and Warden in the Free State Sunday at
about 7.30 p.m. (17:30 GMT), police confirmed early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to retrieve 34 bodies from the wreckage.
Thirty-one of these were adults and the other three were children.
The only two survivors, Isaiah Ngwabane, 43, and Diko Mzamo, 42,
were admitted to Harrismith hospital," South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted police spokesman Santjie Pieters as
saying.
</P>
<P>
SAPA said that the two survivors are in a stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Pieters said the police had been able to talk to one of the
injured passengers who confirmed that the bus driver lost control
soon after the front tire burst.
</P>
<P>
The driver was among the dead.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were still at the scene in the early hours of
Monday, loading the bodies into trucks to take them to the
mortuary and clearing the scene, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The accident was the worst in the area for years, according to
rescue workers.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Warden ambulance services, Theunis van Niekerk, who
was among the first people to get to the scene, told SAPA the
scene of the accident was shattering.
</P>
<P>
"When we got there three people were thrown out of the bus and
the rest were trapped inside. All the people in the bus were
already dead... It was the worst accident I have ever seen in this
area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Usually when we undertake rescue operations we are used to
people screaming for help, hopeful people, but this time it was
all quiet and saddening. It was awful to see victims with broken
hands, arms and a couple of amputated feet."
</P>
<P>
Van Niekerk said he and his duty staff of three were overawed
by the situation and failed to cope. They had to call for
assistance from other towns.
</P>
<P>
About 15 emergency vehicles from Warden, Harrismith and
Villiers rushed to the scene soon after the accident.
</P>
<P>
The bus was travelling form Kokstad, KwaZulu-Natal to
Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Closes 160 Unlicensed Water Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has shut down 160
unlicensed water companies which were accused by the government of
selling tap water to consumers and trading in people's health,
the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Health Minister Karam Karam on
Sunday on a tour of public hospitals in the country's southern
cities.
</P>
<P>
Karam said that the decision was made after the government's
Central Laboratory confirmed that products samples of these firms
contained bacteria that could prove harmful to people's health.
</P>
<P>
A large number of these companies were merely "filling up
bottles with tap water" and selling them, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that despite the fact that certain influential
political parties and figures were behind some of the companies
concerned, he would not go back on his decision unless he received
assurances that the water they are selling is safe.
</P>
<P>
Except Mona Cool and Nahel, the country's only two licensed
water firms, Lebanon's all 160 unlicensed water companies will be
affected by the government's decision.

The two banks are followed by the Commercial Bank of Africa
whose base leading rate is 18 percent. The National Bank of Kenya
announced last week that it had reduced its base leading rate to
19 percent from February 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the base lending rates which the four major banks
compete fiercely, the rates paid to savers vary widely from bank
to bank.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts have urged the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to
find ways to prevailing on commercial banks to reduce the large
margin between the interest rate they pay for the deposits and the
prime rates they charge the customers.
</P>
<P>
But the CBK argued that its hands are tied because the country
is pursuing a liberalized economy, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Bus Crash Claims 34 Lives in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four people were
killed when a bus plunged into a river-bed on the N3 highway in
the area between Villiers and Warden in the Free State Sunday at
about 7.30 p.m. (17:30 GMT), police confirmed early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to retrieve 34 bodies from the wreckage.
Thirty-one of these were adults and the other three were children.
The only two survivors, Isaiah Ngwabane, 43, and Diko Mzamo, 42,
were admitted to Harrismith hospital," South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted police spokesman Santjie Pieters as
saying.
</P>
<P>
SAPA said that the two survivors are in a stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Pieters said the police had been able to talk to one of the
injured passengers who confirmed that the bus driver lost control
soon after the front tire burst.
</P>
<P>
The driver was among the dead.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were still at the scene in the early hours of
Monday, loading the bodies into trucks to take them to the
mortuary and clearing the scene, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The accident was the worst in the area for years, according to
rescue workers.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Warden ambulance services, Theunis van Niekerk, who
was among the first people to get to the scene, told SAPA the
scene of the accident was shattering.
</P>
<P>
"When we got there three people were thrown out of the bus and
the rest were trapped inside. All the people in the bus were
already dead... It was the worst accident I have ever seen in this
area," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Usually when we undertake rescue operations we are used to
people screaming for help, hopeful people, but this time it was
all quiet and saddening. It was awful to see victims with broken
hands, arms and a couple of amputated feet."
</P>
<P>
Van Niekerk said he and his duty staff of three were overawed
by the situation and failed to cope. They had to call for
assistance from other towns.
</P>
<P>
About 15 emergency vehicles from Warden, Harrismith and
Villiers rushed to the scene soon after the accident.
</P>
<P>
The bus was travelling form Kokstad, KwaZulu-Natal to
Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Citizens Give 10 Percent Spending to Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Figures from the National
Bureau of Statistics show that about 10 percent of Chinese
citizens' living expenditure went to residence and related charges.
</P>
<P>
Citizens in 35 major Chinese cities put an average of 10.01
cent living expenditure for charges on housing and the supply of
water, electricity and fuels in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The charge was highest in Wuhan, capital city of central China'
s Hubei Province, where people had to give 17 percent of their
living expenditure, the bureau said, adding that it accounted for
7.9 percent and 8.1 percent of the living expenditure of citizens
in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more Chinese individuals are buying houses
and apartments on their own, according to the latest figures
offered by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Buildings sold to individuals in the first 11 months last year
amounted to 80.6 billion yuan worth, a surge of 31.8 billion yuan,
or 65 percent, over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Total sales value of commercial buildings between January and
November hit 125 billion yuan, jumping 51 percent on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out a series of housing reforms that
encourage individuals to buy houses and apartments, and several
banks have extended loans to individual house buyers.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Indian Sub-continent Drifting Northward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Geological, geophysical and
seismic studies done on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by Chinese and U.
S. scientists indicate that the Indian sub-continent is drifting
northward.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that this discovery also provides direct
evidence to prove the plate hypothesis and it has been picked up
by the U.S.'s Science magazine. They say the studies proved that
the Indian sub-continent drifted quite a number of times, moving
at least 150 kilometers northward.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Chinese and U.S. scientists have done geodetic
electromagnetic, isotopic, seismic and other studies along a 400-
kilometer section of the earth's crust that is 2 to 100 kilometers
below the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
They set off hundreds of tons of explosive devices along the
400-kilometer section and found at least an 80-kilometer
earthquake zone that came into existence after the first collision
of the Indian and Eurasian continents.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say they believe the discovery could be important
for research on the Himalayas earthquake zone and the occurrence
of earthquakes generally.

<HEADLINE> Developing States Should Not Rely on Foreign Aid: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has said that people in developing countries
should not rely on foreign aid if they want to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign aid was responsible for decreasing morale and
self-initiatives in developing countries," the ILO representative
in East Africa, Ali Ibrahim, said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The African, a Dar es Salaam-based newspaper, Monday quoted the
ILO official as saying that over-dependence on foreign aid would
only aggravate the poverty problem.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who was touring Kisarawe District in east Tanzania's
Coast Region during the weekend, said that it was high time
developing countries devised means to eradicate poverty motivating
local manpower and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The ILO representative, accompanied by Tanzanian Minister of
Labor and Youth Development, Paul Kimiti, visited an agricultural
project developed by retired soldiers and retrenched civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
Burdened with an external debt of some eight billion U.S.
Dollars, Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world,
with its gross national product (GNP) per capita less than 200
U.S. Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim urged the Tanzanians to rekindle self-reliance spirit
and consider foreign aid only as complementary in their national
development, otherwise the country is not likely to make much
progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable output has had rapid
development in China in the past decade, thanks to the use of new
technology, People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that agronomists at the China Academy of Agricultural
Sciences say that the amount of land used for vegetable growing
increased 97.5 percent between 1988 and 1998 and total output grew
101.9 percent from 155 million tons to 313 million tons, per
capita growth from 119 kilos in 1988 to 253 kilos last year.
</P>
<P>
China produced 250 billion yuan worth of vegetables yearly and
people have got away from storing large amounts of Chinese cabbage
in winter, because of the diversity. The newspaper attributed this
change to the aggressive development of vegetable growing
technology, disease prevention, and new storage technique.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that agronomists have improved more than 1,000
types of vegetables in the past decade, greatly increasing
productivity.

OTTAWA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- American Michelle Roark claimed
her second title on the second day of the freestyle skiing World
Cup at Whistler, British Columbia with a gold in women's dual
moguls event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The winner of Saturday's singles event beat U.S. teammate
Brooke Ballachey in the dual final after wins against Norway's
Ingrid Berntsen and Kari Traa in the semifinal and quarter-final
elimination rounds.
</P>
<P>
Competition in the men's dual moguls was marred by controversy
in both the semifinals and finals.
</P>
<P>
Despite a forward tumble on the course after his second jump,
France's Thony Hemery knocked off his semi-final rival Quebec's
Dominick Gauthier and advanced to the final, which he won by
defeating American Alex Wilson.
</P>
<P>
The men's event was further muddied by the disqualification of
American Alex Wilson in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Before his second jump Wilson performed a front flip off the
jump as a tribute to the audience, a manoeuvre which is illegal
under the International Skiing Federation (FIS) rules and
requires an immediate disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Though Wilson argued that the event was over before his stunt,
judges disqualified him and lifted Gauthier into second place.

<HEADLINE> China's Passenger Traffic Rises amid Drop in Freight Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Puts Economic Growth at Over 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's economic growth rate
in the second year (1998-99) of the Fifth Five-Year Plan is
expected to exceed 5 percent against the projected growth rate of
5.9 percent, according to State Minister for Planning Mohiuddin
Khan Alamgir.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier estimated the domestic gross product
(GDP) growth rate at 5 percent following the century's worst flood
that hit the country for over two months last year.
</P>
<P>
All economic indicators have shown a gradual upward trend and
the government predicted the growth rate because the country's
agricultural sector has bounced back after the flood, the state
minister was Monday quoted by The Bangladesh Observer newspaper as
saying at a meeting held here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate would exceed 7 percent in the next three
years of the five-year plan period, he said, adding that even if
the growth rate could reach 6.5 percent in the event of any
unforeseen circumstances, it would be better than the past.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that the total investment in the Fifth
Five-Year Plan was estimated at 1.96 trillion taka (about 40.4
billion U.S. dollars) and a significant portion of the investment
would come from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, 22 percent would come from GDP, 9
percent from domestic resources and 6 percent from remittances
from Bangladeshi expatriates and foreign direct investment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate during the period has been projected at
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has opened the economy to the private sector
which would face the challenge of economic development and it has
also made policy reforms to provide support to the private sector
for infrastructure development, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Cut Independence Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to hold its 51st Independence Day celebrations, due on
February 4, without the traditional tri-services parade, military
sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Instead the role of the forces will be restricted to a
tri-services guard of honor, presentation of arms and a 21-gun
salute by the navy, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the main reason for this limited scale
celebration was that the government did not want to withdraw tanks
and other equipment form operational areas for a parade in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>

<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced here
Monday that it has agreed to provide a 23.3 million U.S. dollar
loan to the Philippines for developing safe water and sanitation
services in small towns.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the bank said it signed a loan
agreement with the Development Bank of the Philippines last week.
</P>
<P>
If the Local Government Unit Urban Water and Sanitation Project
is successfully implemented by the Philippine government, many
residents living in small towns will start getting clean water and
improved sanitation services, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the project will assist selected local government units
that have an average of fewer than 30,000 people, to provide
sustainable water and sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the first of three to be disbursed through the
World Bank's adaptable program loan, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The second loan is contingent on the success of the initial
loan, it added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Studies Exit Tax for Foreign Capital Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is studying an
exit tax for foreign capital repatriation, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying areas including an exit tax in order to
facilitate foreign equity investors to take out the capital they
have brought in probably earlier than September 1 this year,"
Mahathir told a press conference at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Sepang upon his return after attending the World
Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would decide whether or not to impose an
exit tax in a few weeks' time to enable early repatriation of
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, uncertain on the imposition of an exit tax, said
however an exit tax should be favorable to Malaysia and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed capital controls on September 1 last year,
requiring foreign equity investors to lock in capital in the
country for at least one year in efforts to stabilize the stock
market. But after September 1 this year, they are free to take out
their money.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the foreign funds locked in the country
accounted for about 23 percent of the market capitalization of 300
billion ringgit (about 78.947 billion U.S. dollars), which works
out to about 69 billion ringgit (about 18.157 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
There has been high expectation that the Malaysian government
would impose an exit tax to give foreigners flexibility in
repatriating their money earlier than the one-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the government was still not yet certain how
to treat capital brought in and the profits or capital gains made
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the restrictions on currencies only applied to
the ringgit and that all business transactions were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments continued to be welcomed in Malaysia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said what was needed was that currency trading should
be open; be conducted in a fixed place with detailed reports so
that the traders could be identified; reveal how much was
involved; reveal the currencies used; and reveal which country the
traders originated from.

BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen met with Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the Lithuanian
Parliament, here this morning.
</P>

Qian commented that the two countries kept frequent friendly
exchanges since the formation of diplomatic ties and the inter-
parliament contacts also witnessed good development. "
Geographically apart from each other, the two countries, who have
long historic links and have no realistic conflicts, have the
conditions to further promote the cooperation in all fields, in
particular the cooperation in the economic and trade arena in
accordance with the requirements of the market economy," he told
the guests.
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis briefed the Chinese host on the foreign policy of
Lithuania, as well as the cooperation between the two countries
after the establishment of diplomatic relations. He expressed the
hope to speed up the bilateral cooperation in politic and economic
fields and strengthen the exchanges between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Qian's meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
also met with Landsbergis and his party.

<HEADLINE> New Power Unit Goes Into Operation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A new 210-megawatt unit of the
Ghorasal power plant in northeast Bangladesh's Narsingdi district
went into operation on Sunday, press reports here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sixth unit of the Ghorasal Thermal Plant would add 210 mw
to the country's biggest power house feeding the national grid.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying hard to generate more power to meet the
increasing demand of the people for electricity," said Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina while switching on the unit.
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity of power generation in Bangladesh is
3,091 mw, but the available power generation capacity is only
1900-2000 mw against the peak hour requirement of 2300 mw.
</P>
<P>
With the add-on, the Ghorasal Power Center would generate
950-mw electricity, about 30 percent of the installed capacity of
the country's total power plants.
</P>
<P>
The project was implemented at a cost of 6,732.8 million taka
(about 138.8 million U.S. dollars), including 3948.7 million taka
(about 81.4 million dollars) from foreign assistance, officials
said. Russia provided credit for the plant and the rest of the
money came from the Bangladesh government and the Bangladesh Power
Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The government had a plan to increase the total power
generation to over 5,000 mw by the year 2002 against the growing
demand of 4,051 mw, according to G.M. Mandal, energy and power
division secretary of the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's Two Entities Agree to Reduce Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Military leaders of Bosnia's
two entities Sunday agreed to cut the size of their forces on the
basis of a joint security policy at a three-day meeting in
Sarajevo presided over by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Commander-in-Chief of
the Muslim-Croat Army Rasim Delic called for the establishment of
a joint security policy before streamlining the troops to prevent
possible conflicts between the two entities -- the Muslim-Croat
Federation and the Serbs' Republic.
</P>
<P>
He said the security policy should include the "Partnership
for Peace" program to bring Bosnia into the Western integration.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Bosnian Serb Army Momir Talic
said it is possible for Bosnia to reduce its military strength,
expressing hope for concrete achievement in this field.
</P>
<P>
He said that the implementation of the Dayton accord is now
guaranteed by the NATO-led multinational Stabilization Force in
Bosnia, but that the two entities must learn to maintain national
security on their own, which requires, above all, mutual
confidence between them.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister of the Serbs' Republic Manojlo Milovanovic
told the press conference that the prerequisite of the mutual
confidence is to stop "illegal funding for the troops," including
all financial support outside the equipment and training programs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Serbs' Republic, unlike the Muslim-Croat
Federation, has never received any military aid from Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Market Volatility May Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- After climbing steadily for
months, Asian markets saw constant volatility in the first month
of 1999, mainly due to the introduction of the euro and the
outbreak of a financial crisis in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Asia still lacks its own ground for
stabilization, and any bad news from within or outside the region
could easily shake the region's markets in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, an Asian market recovery from around last October to
early January did not reflect the region's actual economic health,
but a false boom led by a stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the weak U.S. dollar policy, the Japanese yen
appreciated nearly 30 percent to 111 yen against the dollar in
early January from a low of 147 last August.
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, helped Asian currencies rebound continuously for
several months and sparked a rally in Asian stocks that defies
conventional logic, as most Asian economies have not climbed out
of a regional crisis yet.
</P>
<P>
However, the introduction of the euro, which has reduced Asia's
dependence on the U.S. dollar, on the New Year's day had pushed
most Asian currencies and stocks to new record highs in six or
seven months.
</P>
<P>
That phenomenon lasted until a Brazil financial crisis shook
the world financial market on January 13. Although the Brazilian
crisis has not caused a panic in Asian markets so far, Asian
currencies and stocks have fluctuated quite often in recent days,
sometimes even 5 percent a day.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, Asian markets lost its own direction.
While most regional currencies followed the lead of the Japanese
yen, Asian stocks traced the course of the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that because Asian markets have not firmed its
ground for a real recovery, outside influence may continue to
affect their direction at least in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Those factors which could easily destabilize Asian markets
include the Brazil crisis, the euro and the Japanese yen, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Of these outside factors, the deterioration of the Brazil
crisis remains a biggest threat to the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
If the 30 percent devaluation of the Brazil currency, the real,
since January 13 would force competitive devaluations of other
Latin American currencies, and if the Brazil crisis prompts a
contagion throughout Latin America, an Asian market tumble could
hardly be avoid, economists said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Asian markets reacted relatively calmly to the
Brazil crisis only because the impact of the crisis on Asia has
not been felt yet.
</P>
<P>
But if an economic collapse in Latin America slows down growth
of the United States and Europe, the major trade partners of Asian
economies, an economic recovery in Asian will be at peril, and
accordingly Asian markets would see a turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Another potential threat to the Asian market stabilization is
the euro. Despite its rousing send-off and powerful political
backing, Europe's new common currency faces plenty of perils in
the months and years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Europe's growth is slowing, unemployment is high, currency
markets remain volatile and the 11 Euroland economies are far from
unified. Speculators might prey on disparities created by the
transition period before 2002.
</P>
<P>
If the euro is hit by any shocks, the world financial markets,
including Asian markets, would become volatile, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the future course of the Japanese yen would also
affect the direction of Asian markets. The appreciation of the yen
in the recent months is attributed to interest rate cuts in the
United States and current-account surplus, but the Japanese
economy is unlikely to come out of a recession this year.
</P>
<P>
Since a stronger yen will inevitablly hurt Japan's economic
growth, Tokyo may not let its currency rise continuously by
intervening in the market. As Asian economies' major creditor and
export destination, Japan's any move will affect the region's
market course, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Number of Street Kids in Indonesia Hits 50,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Street kids in Indonesia have
increased to 50,000 driven by economic crisis, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of vagrant children is on the rise and it's not easy
to get them off the street, Antara News Agency reported Monday
quoting Social Affairs Minister Justika Baharsjah.
</P>
<P>
Justika said on the weekend that many street kids have bad
attitudes and anti-social lifestyles. "And this is related to
crime and disturbances to the society."
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that many street kids work hard and
honestly as singers, shoe polishers and newspaper vendors.
</P>
<P>
"But many others have no employment opportunities, so they have
no money to purchase food. Possibly this scenario prompts them to
commit criminal acts," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said the parents of most street kids lost their jobs as a
result of the economic crisis, and therefore many of the children
are helping their families earn enough to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Justika acknowledged there is no simple solution to the problem
of street kids, as a vast amount of money would be required to
provide welfare to poor families.
</P>
<P>
Reports said, the poor people in Indonesia at the end of 1998
increased to at least 80 million from 22 million in 1997, some 30
million of them experienced absolute poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai narcotics police are
keeping a close watch on xanac, a drug with similar effects as
amphetamine, which is spreading among teenagers frequenting
Bangkok's nightspots.
</P>
<P>
Pol Lt-Gen Komkrij Patpongpanich, Narcotics Suppression Bureau
(NSB) commissioner, was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as
saying that more teenagers are turning to xanac instead of
amphetamine and ecstasy because it is cheaper and has similar
effects.
</P>
<P>
The use of xanac by teenagers was detected several months ago
by nightspot operators.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the problem, he said he has assigned narcotics
policemen to patrol nightspots in popular areas in Bangkok every
night.
</P>
<P>
More information about the drug was also being gathered, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NSB has urged customs officials to help keep a lookout for
xanac as it is classified as a dangerous drug.

stability and economic development."
</P>
<P>
With no clear-cut provincial boundaries, disputes among local
residents are easily sparked, especially along boundaries where
natural resources are abundant.
</P>
<P>
"The task must be taken seriously because today's careless
work will sow the seeds for tomorrow's disputes," Doje was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central government launched the boundary survey in 1996.
By the end of last year, 11,600 kilometers, accounting for 85
percent of the 13,700 kilometers of boundaries assigned for the
year were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Ministry statistics indicate that 47 lines of more than 37,600
kilometers long account for 64 percent of the 69 lines and 58,700
kilometers of boundaries on land that have been surveyed so far.
</P>
<P>
Doje asked all officials involved to guarantee the quality of
the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The survey's procedures must be strictly followed and
documents should conform to standards and be complete."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the survey's results have great value for
the government in many ways, including making comprehensive
development and ecological protection plans.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Official on East Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
decision to offer independence to East Timor was based on
objective reason, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"President B.J. Habibie has looked into the matter more
objectively," the president's political adviser Dewi Fortuna Anwar
told a private television station RCTI on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, however, admitted that from the economic point of view,
independence for East Timor "doesn't make sense."
</P>
<P>
No less than 93 percent of East Timor's provincial budget come
from Jakarta as the territory's revenues can only contribute 3
percent to the budget.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said if
the government's offer to give the troubled province of East Timor
special autonomy were to be rejected, the central government will
let it go (get independence).
</P>
<P>
Military leaders have also expressed their support to the
government decision. The Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen.
Wiranto said that ABRI will be ready to safeguard its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more public figures have stated their
agreement with the government that independence is the best
alternative to resolve the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an ideal, and realistic (solution)," Marzuki
Darusman of the National Commission on Human Rights said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the main factors triggering clashes and unrest
in the former Portuguese colony in recent months is uncertainty
over the solution to the East Timor problem.
</P>
<P>
Sharing his opinion, Ryaas Rasyid, director general at the Home
Affairs Ministry, said independence for East Timor means a
lessening of the burden for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, some opposition parties opposed the government
decision to release East Timor immediately. They said the best
solution is to conduct a referendum in two or three years' time
over the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the U.N. has not
recognized the move.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: More Japanese Aid, Investment Pour in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Since Japan resumed its
assistance to Myanmar in 1992, it has been providing grants-in-aid
for debt relief and other grant aids to the country, standing as
Myanmar's major aid provider.
</P>
<P>
Japan was once the biggest donor to Myanmar in the past.
However, it suspended aid to the country in late 1988 on account
of the then situation until 1992.
</P>
<P>
The resumed assistance is said to be offering in line with the
Japanese government's Official Development Aid (ODA) policy,
taking into account some positive developments in Myanmar in terms
of economic reform among others.
</P>
<P>
The grants-in-aid for debt relief, which have been extended to
Myanmar for several times with an amount ranging from 2 billion
yens (15 million U.S. dollars) to 5 billion yens (37 million
dollars) on each occasion, are aimed at relieving the burden of
debts the Myanmar government owes to the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Other forms of aid, so far extended, helped Myanmar implement
development projects of agriculture, health, rural community and
human resources as well as HIV/AIDS prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also obtaining assistance from Japan in its forest
greening project in arid zone. With the help of Japan's JIFPRO
Group and 10 other organizations, a three-year project from 1998
to 2000 to plant trees as forest reserve protection plantations in
central Mandaly division's Nyaung U township is underway.
</P>
<P>
Under the technical assistance program, Japan is also helping
Myanmar implement a seed bank project in Yezin, Pyinmana in the
central part and a forestry training center and an irrigation
technology center in Yangon and Bago respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the sector of drug control, Japan is among countries which
help Myanmar implement measures to eradicate poppy cultivation in
the country by introducing alternative development programs.
</P>
<P>
With the Japanese government's financial support, a 21-country
seminar on the move was held in Yangon in March 1998, exchanging
information and experiences for substituting poppy with the
alternative programs.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese buckwheat-opium substitute production pilot project
in northern Shan state's Ta Shwe Tang area has proved highly
successful, bringing about the beginning of commercial production
of the crop last December.
</P>
<P>
At a time when its aid is resuming to Myanmar, Japan is also
injecting more investment in the country, reaching 223.56 million
dollars in 20 projects at the end of October 1998 and ranking the
ninth among 23 countries or regions which have a total of 7.089
billion dollars of investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan brought in 20 million dollars' investment in establishing
 Myanmar's first foreign-invested industrial zone -- the
Mingaladon Industrial Zone -- in the north of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructural facilities of the 89-hectare industrial
zone, set up by Mitsui of Japan, was completed in June 1998 after
two years' construction. More Japanese investment is expected to
be mainly obtained to set up enterprises there for further
development.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Nippon Oil Company in development of the
Yetagun Gas Field off Tanintharyi coast along with Britain's
Premier, Malaysia's Petronas and Thailand's PTTEP oil companies
also highlights Japan's investment in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The engagement of the Kajima Corporation in two diversion
tunnel projects of the Paunglaung hydro-electric power station in
central Pyinmana also signifies one of Japan's major investment
projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, there opened so far eight Japanese bank
representative offices in Myanmar with three marine and fire
insurance companies reaching accords with the state-owned Myanmar
Insurance to set up joint ventures respectively.
</P>
<P>
In June, 1996, Japan's Daiwa Institute of Research also set up
a joint venture securities exchange center with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese investments cover manufacturing, hotels and
tourism, real estate, mining, transport and communications, and
livestock and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the establishment of the Myanmar-Japan Economic
Cooperation Committee between the chambers of commerce and
industry of the two countries in February 1998 has further
enhanced their economic cooperation as bilateral ties develop.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Bulls Rebuilding Team with Little Hope This Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls, six-time
NBA Finals champion in eight years, look weak and hopeless to
enter the playoffs this season after eight players left.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult at times, and teams might be
giving us a pounding," said Bill Wennington, one of seven Bulls
left over from last year's championship team.
</P>
<P>
"But we're out there and we're getting paid well to play
basketball and try to win games. Whether it's working out or
not, we still have to be out there, so we have to make the best
of it."
</P>
<P>
Chicago is going through one of the biggest rebuilding efforts
in NBA history. The Bulls didn't just break up, they blew up,
with pieces scattering every way.
</P>
<P>
General manager Jerry Krause decided it was best to clear the
floor and start over with youth. Scottie Pippen went to the
Houston Rockets. Luc Longley was shipped to Phoenix and Steve
Kerr to San Antonio. Dennis Rodman retired, unretired and is now
doing who knows what.
</P>
<P>
That leaves the Bulls with NBA rookie coach Tim Floyd, Ron
Harper, Toni Kukoc, a few free agents with one-year deals, a
couple of extra draft picks and enough cap room for next year's
free agency period.
</P>
<P>
Chicago signed Brent Barry to a six-year, 27 million dollars
deal, making him the cornerstone in the rebuidling process.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a daunting tast," Floyd said. "I'm standing
here in front of six trophies, you've got a Hall of Game coach
and you're replacing and the best basketball player in the world
left your team," said Floyd.
</P>
<P>
Krause said: "It took us six years to get to the level of
winning an NBA championship. If they have some patience again, we
will work extremely hard and hope to get back to that same
level."

<HEADLINE> Italy Warns Against Euro Currency Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian intelligence authorities
Sunday warned against a possible spate of currency counterfeiting
in the euro zone with the introduction of euro coins and
banknotes.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence agency of the Italian Interior Ministry said
the changeover "appears certain to fuel illegal trafficking in
counterfeit currency which will benefit from the inevitable
period of confusion and disorientation" after euro coins and
banknotes are put in circulation on January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British weekly Sunday Telegraph said the
Italian Mafia has already printed millions of fake euro
banknotes, and that Britain's National Criminal Intelligence
Service is in close contact with Italian police authorities who
are taking action on this front.
</P>
<P>
The Italian secret service also cited the prospects of easily
laundering dirty money with the conversion to the new currency.
</P>
<P>
It said fake banknotes could slip into border criminal
activities "linked to the immigration of non-European Union na
tionals as well as laundering illegal earnings through European
markets."
</P>
<P>
It vowed to mount a united fight against counterfeiting, not
only on the anti-crime front but also on the front of raising
public awareness to the issue.

GUIYANG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 primary schools have
been set up in poor parts of southwest China's Guizhou province
in the past eight years to help children resume their education.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the province began Project Hope, a national education
project that helps children who have dropped out of school resume
their education. It has so far got over 30 million yuan in
domestic and foreign donations, which helped 50,000 local
children return to school, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, books, teaching equipment, and VCDs have been
donated to the schools, he said. But, 1.5 million square meters
of the province's school buildings are in urgent need of repairs
and they are asking for more donations.

<HEADLINE> Italy Denies Ocalan's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government on Sunday
denied that Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is "probably"
back in Italy as Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit claimed.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Sunday afternoon the Italian government
categorically ruled out the possibility that Ocalan was back in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini already told the
parliament that Ocalan had been escorted to the border by Italian
security officers and left Italy in a private plane, the Italian
news agency ANSA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Anadolu news agency had reported that Ecevit, in
answering journalists' questions in Ankara Sunday, said that an
unspecified "reliable source" in Italy claimed that Ocalan was
about to arrive back in Italy, but that it was not clear if the
Kurdish leader was planning to stay there or continue on to
another destination.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was cited as saying that there was no doubt that Ocalan
had left Italy but he was supposedly on his way back, "we do not
know why or from where he comes."
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader left Rome on January
16 and now reportedly lives in Russia or an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Rome on November 12 last year under
international arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey after
he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But later Germany said that it will not seek Ocalan's
extradition to Germany, for fear of sparking confrontation
between the Kurdish and Turkish communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish extradition request accused Ocalan of committing a
long list of terrorism and terrorism-related crimes. Turkey
blames Ocalan for the more than 30,000 deaths during his 15-year
armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey's extradition is ruled out by Italian Law, which
prohibits forceful repatriation to countries where the death
sentence is in force.
</P>
<P>
Italy's rejection of Turkish demands for Ocalan's extradition
has caused a rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Germany agreed on November 27 that Ocalan be tried
by an international tribunal supported by the European Union
(EU). But no member of the EU is willing to host the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel
restriction on Ocalan, and on December 23, Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema announced that the Kurdish rebel leader could
leave Italy and "is free to go wherever he wants," ignoring the
extradition request of the Turkish government.

<HEADLINE> Light, Electromagnetic Waves Promote Crop Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a new method which uses artificial light,
electromagnetic waves and sound to promote the rapid growth of
crops.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jingzhi, a professor at north China's Hebei University,
developed a luminescence tube which emits light waves at certain
frequencies to increase crop output by 20-30 percent and reduce
the maturation period by between 7-10 days.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that artificial light used in conjunction
with other physical means including electromagnetic waves can
improve growth hormone and in some cases alter genes in various
crops.
</P>
<P>
The local governments plans to develop the promising "physical
fertilizer" which might possibly replace conventional chemical
fertilizers in some areas during the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The arbitration hearing into
the drug case against American long-distance runner Mary Slaney
was adjourned on Sunday until April, the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) said in Monte Carlo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Slaney's lawyers and the IAAF both agreed to the decision,
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
Rerneri was quoted saying it had been agreed that more time
was needed to examine the case. The hearing began on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Slaney, considered the greatest women's distance runner in
U.S. history, tested positive at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic trials
and was accordingly suspended by USA Track and Field (USATF).
</P>
<P>
But she challenged the ruling and was finally cleared in
September 1997 before IAAF referred the case to arbitration.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The port of Guangzhou, a
leading shipping center in south China, reported an increase in
the cargo volume handled in 1998 in spite of the continuing

<P>
The port handled a total of 78.6 million tons of cargoes and
850,000 TEU (twenty feet equivalent unit) of containers last
year, up four percent and 24 percent on an annual basis,
respectively.

The total business volume ranked third in the nation,
following Shanghai and Ningbo, said Huang Guosheng, director of

greatly from the nationwide anti-smuggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
The port has made a plan to increase this year's cargo volume
to 80 million tons and one million TEU of containers, he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The city has responded to intense competition by expanding

<HEADLINE> Harbin Botanical Garden Attracts Owls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of owls are spending
the winter in a botanical garden in Harbin, capital of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The garden, which covers 130 hectares in the southwestern part
of the urban area, offers a quiet environment and flourishing
trees which have attracted a variety of birds, including owls.
</P>
<P>
The environment is enhanced by the fact local citizens are
fond of birds and no hunting is allowed in the garden, said a
local source.
</P>
<P>
Owls, which are listed under second-class state protection,
catch their prey at night. The birds have keen eyesight which
enables them to hunt at night, with their main prey consisting of
mice. However, poor daylight vision requires owls to depend on
their hearing for safety.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Cuts Key Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Effective Monday, the overnight
rates of the Philippine Central Bank will be reduced across the
board by 0.375 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Business World newspaper Monday, the bank's
overnight borrowing rate will go down from 12.875 to 12.5 percent
and its overnight lending rate from 14.875 to 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the bank has approved a reduction in the
liquid reserve requirement on banks by two percent, from 7 percent
to 5 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The move signals the bank's adoption of an aggressive policy in
handling the country's pestering problem of high interest rates,
which is considered one of the highest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank rate and reserve cuts may have a
negative impact on the peso-dollar exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
A cut in peso deposit rates tends to make peso instruments less
attractive vis-a-vis their dollar counterparts, thus encouraging
local banks to speculate on the foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reducing bank's liquidity reserves is also expected
to free up funds for peso-dollar speculation.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank said that expected inflows of at least 650
million U.S. dollars this month will help stabilize the Philippine
currency.

BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- China's postal system plans to
concentrate on improving its networks and services for a targeted
business income of 36.5 billion yuan this year, Postmaster
General Liu Liqing said recently.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the State Postal Bureau (SPB), which controls
China's postal sector, will not put money into any non-productive
projects this year.
</P>
<P>
The network improvements will include a wide area network and
a local area network, as well as a connection between the two,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Computerization of the postal system is also a priority and
all these goals require the development of software as well, Liu
explained.
</P>
<P>
The SPB is also planning new service standards at their
counters, and delivery and handling time limits, with public
supervision encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The SPB will develop point-to-point parcel deliveries and make
mail-order purchases more convenient, the official said.

<HEADLINE> World Figures Interested in Egypt's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the World
Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland have demonstrated
interest in Egypt's experience and accomplishments in developing
economy, an Egyptian official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Othman, head of Egypt's State Information Service, who is
accompanying President Hosni Mubarak for the forum, also said to
Middle East News Agency that on the sidelines of the economic
forum, Mubarak met with Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange
Richard Grasso Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Grasso said after the meeting that he was keen on meeting
Mubarak to get familiar with Egypt's experience in economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Grasso spoke highly of Egypt's achievements in
bringing down inflation and budget deficit and speeding up
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started economic reforms in 1991 by loosening control
over or privatize state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the economic growth has risen from the then 2
percent to the current 5 percent, inflation fallen from 20 percent
to below 5 percent and budget deficit to less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak also held talks with chairman of the Davos
economic forum Klaus Schwabb on Egypt's economic reforms, which
Schwabb said have spared Egypt economic crisis plaguing other
countries, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Schwabb also discussed the world's economic
situation in light of globalization.
</P>

A total of 40 heads of states, 250 famous politicians and over
1,000 leading businessmen around the world are attending the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Water Shortage Persists in Cyprus Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The recent rainy season has
brought little relief to Cyprus, which entered its fourth straight
year of drought, as reservoir levels have dropped to all-time low.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, an average precipitation
of 256 millimeters has fallen throughout Cyprus since October 1,
1998, the start of the meteorological year.
</P>
<P>
This is 87 percent of normal (294mm) for the period in
question. Rainfall in the 1997-1998 meteorological year as a total
was only 75 percent of normal.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rain has fallen in the central and western
plains. Snow has accumulated in the mountains. As a result, most
of the runoff did not flow into the rivers that feed reservoirs,
90 percent of which are now empty.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 3 million cubic meters of water in
the reservoirs while the annual water demand of the island is
about 140 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Constructions of mobile or permanent desalination plants,
billed as "emergency" measures in a government program, remained
flat on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said they expect the second permanent
desalination plant of the island to be in operation in June 2000,
but informed sources forecast that potable water will not flow out
of the plant before sometime into 2001.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the present water shortage is that
irrigation demands has increased by 20 percent since 1990, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of underground water, which accounts for 80 percent
of Cyprus' water supply, has declined by half since the 1960s due
to overpumping.
</P>
<P>
In face of the serious shortage caused by the continuing
drought, Cyprus' House of Representatives (parliament) has passed
legislation imposing tough sanctions against anyone found wasting
water.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Cyprus government has planned to issue permits for the
construction of four water-devouring golf courses as part of its
campaign to increase tourism. Each course consumes 1,000 cubic
meters water per day, enough to meet the needs of a community of
9,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sees Morocco as Springboard in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Egypt sees Morocco as a
springboard for it to promote foreign trade in Africa, Europe and
America, an Egyptian official in charge of investment said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Rabat for an investment promotion campaign,
Ibrahim Fawzi, head of Egypt's General Authority for Investment,
told reporters that Morocco is a gateway to northwestern Africa,
Western Europe, North and South America in trade.
</P>
<P>
Stressing their sound bilateral relations, Fawzi said there are
"numerous and diverse" prospects and fields of joint investments
between Egypt and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Fawzi will take part in a seminar on
joint investments organized by the Egyptian-Moroccan Business
Council, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official expressed regret that despite the
excellent bilateral political relations, the two countries have
set up only six joint investment companies with a total capital of
126.47 million U.S. dollars, to which Morocco has contributed 9.12
million dollars, or 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, in a campaign to attract foreign investments and to
diversify trade partners, has been exerting efforts to enhance
economic and trade relations with developing countries, the Arab
and African states in particular.
