FBI Report Shows Drop in Crime
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious crimes reported to the police dropped for an
eighth consecutive year in 1999, down 7 percent from the year before and by far
the longest-running crime decline on record, the FBI reported Sunday. The FBI
report showed that all seven major types of crime were down not only nationwide,
but also in each region of the nation, and in suburbs, rural areas and in cities
of all sizes. President Clinton said the report ''confirms that our anti-crime
strategy -- more police officers on the beat, fewer illegal guns and violent
criminals on the street -- is having a powerful impact.''

Rebels Advance Through Sierra Leone Ends
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A rebel advance through Sierra Leone's
interior ended with the rebels ''melting away'' into the jungle, a U.N. official
said Sunday, cooling a clash that involved United Nations forces and a
helicopter gunship from the government. One day after the peace process in this
West African nation seemed doomed, leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front and U.N. officials flew together by helicopter to check out the area where
their forces clashed a day earlier. As many as 500 peacekeepers are believed to
be held by the rebels. Why they were seized remained unclear Sunday.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin pledged to finish building democracy
in Russia and restore the country to its world power status during his inaugural
speech Sunday, which marked the first democratic transfer of power in the vast
nation's history. Moving swiftly to tackle the ailing economy, the country's
biggest problem, Putin's first act was to name economics specialist Mikhail
Kasyanov as prime minister. Kasyanov is a well-regarded moderate who backs
market reforms.

   MOSS POINT, Miss. (AP) -- A chain reaction of collisions involving 16 cars,
two tour buses and two 18-wheelers left at least five people dead, authorities
said. In Wisconsin, a car carrying four teen-agers on a prom-night outing
collided with another vehicle early Sunday and both vehicles burst into flames,
killing the teens and the one person inside the other vehicle. Troopers said the
Mississippi accident happened just after 5 a.m. on Interstate 10 near the
Alabama state line. Fifty to 70 people were involved.

Charges of Fraud in Iran's Elections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-liners said Sunday they had found evidence of vote
fraud in Iran's February elections that were swept by reformers, raising fears
that they would annul victories of candidates who support loosening the
conservative clergy's rule. The suspected fraud was in the capital of Tehran,
where reformists won 29 of 30 seats in the 290-seat parliament. Tehran was the
top prize in a nationwide victory for reformers, who ousted conservatives from
control of the legislature for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution
brought the clergy to power.

<HEADLINE> Actor-producer Douglas Fairbanks Jr. dead at 90  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a rakishly handsome actor
from the earliest days of film who later became a real-life war
hero and friend of royalty, has died. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks died Sunday in Mount Sinai Hospital, said his widow,
Vera Shelton Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks, the son of the swashbuckling superstar of silent
films, made his own mark in some 75 movies, including ''Catherine
the Great,'' ''The Prisoner of Zenda,'' ''Gunga Din,'' ''Little
Caesar,'' ''Sinbad the Sailor'' and ''State Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I never tried to emulate my father. Anyone trying to do that
would be a second-rate carbon copy,'' he once said. ''I was
determined to be my own man, although having the Fairbanks name did
make it easier to get into an office to see someone.''
</P>
<P>
   His stepmother was America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford. His
first wife was Joan Crawford. He said he had affairs with Marlene
Dietrich and Gertrude Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first American officer to command a British
flotilla of raiding craft during a commando operation in World War
II. He served under Adm. Lord Louis Mountbatten, who later
introduced him to his nephew, Prince Philip, the husband of Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks became a favorite of the royal couple, entertaining
them at his home, much to the chagrin of Mayfair society. The first
time they came he had a couple of singers to entertain them --
Maurice Chevalier and Cab Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Entree into the Fairbankses' home is a hundred times more
difficult than getting a ticket for the coronation,'' sniffed one
newspaper columnist.
</P>
<P>
   But Fairbanks and his wife knew how to entertain. When they gave
a spectacular coming out party for their daughter Daphne in 1957,
the queen, Prince Philip and Princess Margaret stayed until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've led an enormously lucky life,'' Fairbanks reflected in
1989. ''I've done what I wanted to do. I worked hard and played
hard, and it was all tremendously rewarding. I just wish it could
go on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said Sunday that ''The queen and
the Duke of Edinburgh will both be sorry to learn of his death.''
</P>
<P>
   The future royal favorite was born in New York City on Dec. 9,
1909 -- the only son of Douglas Fairbanks and his first wife, Anna.
His parents divorced when he was 9, and he lived with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He attended private schools in New York and California and was
tutored in London and Paris. He and his father were not close.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very undemonstrative. There was never an embrace or a
hug. And he was never around -- he'd disappear for months on end.
He'd never remember birthdays or Christmas,'' Fairbanks said of his
father in a New York Times interview.
</P>
<P>
   His movie career began at age 13 with an appearance in ''Stephen
Steps Out.'' The film was not a success, and he resumed his studies
for a time. But in 1925 he made several more films, and the
influential movie magazine Photoplay said that at his studio, ''he
is considered a real bet, with much of his father's charm and
artistry.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his stage debut in Los Angeles in 1927, winning good
reviews. He began getting better movie roles, appearing with Greta
Garbo in ''A Woman of Affairs'' and in a Frank Capra film, ''The
Power of the Press,'' both in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   His career picked up with the coming of sound. In the early
1930s he had a string of film successes, including a showy role in
''Little Caesar,'' and was able to write his own ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I demanded and received approval of cast, story and director.
I don't know how I got away with it, but I did!'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At age 19 he married Joan Crawford, then the quintessential
flapper in films such as ''Our Dancing Daughters.'' They divorced
four years later in 1933. He said they parted because he had many
interests while ''work to her was the only reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said they remained friendly up to her death in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Joan Crawford that I've heard about in 'Mommie Dearest' is
not the Joan Crawford I knew back when,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, he married Mary Lee Epling Hartford, former wife of A&AMP;P
supermarket heir Huntington Hartford. They had three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   A lieutenant, j.g., in the U.S. Navy Reserve, he was called to
active service later that year and served until 1946. He trained
and led commando units, doing convoy service on the dangerous
Murmansk run.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a chestful of medals, including an American Silver
Star, the British Distinguished Service Cross and the French Legion
of Honor. A French commendation said in part:
</P>
<P>
   ''With electric power gone, radio shot away, with German shells
continually straddling or near-missing his ships, he successfully
deployed the unit behind a smoke screen and emerged in a new and
tactically superior position.
</P>
<P>
   ''He closed with the enemy and, after an intense exchange of
fire, both German ships were sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Fairbanks was chairman of the fund-raising
committee for CARE, which sent more than $150 million worth of food
parcels and other goods to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He resumed his film career with ''Sinbad the Sailor,'' one of
the biggest hits of 1946. His last movie was ''Ghost Story'' in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Besides acting, he was involved in a variety of business
enterprises -- from ball point pens to land development, theatrical
copyrights to film production.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he produced 160 episodes of a television anthology
series called ''Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents.'' He starred in
approximately a quarter of the 30-minute programs, which were
filmed in England.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1950s and '60s he appeared in revivals of ''My Fair
Lady'' and ''The Pleasure of His Company'' as well as a variety of
television specials and guest appearances on shows ranging from
''Laugh-In'' to ''Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   He once said of all his accomplishments he was proudest of the
articles and stories he published over the years. He published the
first volume of his autobiography, ''The Salad Days,'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   His second wife died of cancer in 1988. In May 30, 1991,
Fairbanks married merchandiser Vera Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks also is survived by three daughters, eight
grandchildren and six great grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fairbanks said her husband will be buried alongside his
father at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Funeral arrangements were
incomplete. There also will be a memorial service for him in
Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Cars, Tractors in Conflict on Roads  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- As urban sprawl puts more people from cities
and suburbs onto rural highways, they are finding a danger hidden
in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   During spring planting season, tractors with wide tillage
equipment and planters crawl along rural roads. In the fall, the
roads are filled with mammoth, slow-moving combines that farmers
use to harvest their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Add unfamiliar, impatient and even enraged drivers to the mix,
and the results can be deadly accidents without any of the usual
traffic hazards -- bad weather, darkness, hills or curves, alcohol
or youthful inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from the Ohio Department of Highway Safety show the
accidents most often occur in the late afternoon, involve sideswipe
or angle collisions, and are often preceded by motorists trying to
pass as farmers make left turns.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ever want a real thrill ride, take a ride with a farmer
on a tractor on a state highway and have him make a left-hand
turn,'' said Steve Homan, who operates a 200-acre dairy farm near
Chickasaw, Ohio. ''If farm prices don't kill the farmer, these
roads will.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safety Council, 88 people were killed
and 700 to 800 injured in U.S. traffic accidents involving farm
vehicles in 1998, the latest year for which figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis in the Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health
questioned whether motorists realize farm vehicles are turning or
misjudge the speed of the turn. It also said the numbers may
suggest that motorists simply don't realize how slow farm vehicles
move.
</P>
<P>
   Homan theorized that motorists become accustomed to the flashing
rear lights of the farm vehicle and do not notice the turn signal.
</P>
<P>
   William Field, director of Purdue University's agricultural
safety and health program, said the statistics tell him that
motorists are simply driving too fast on rural roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''People just can't stop in time when suddenly they have a
tractor in front of them,'' he said. ''It's like hitting a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger hit home for Homan in October 1998, when he lost a
close friend, Kenneth Wuebker, a 48-year-old father of three.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was making a turn with a tractor, and a young fellow went
around him at the wrong time, flipped the tractor over, and it
killed him,'' said Homan. The other driver was estimated to be
going 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, Homan, 44, was on the road with his tractor and
three cars backed up behind him. The first two drivers were patient
and slowed down, but not the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''He passed me and went halfway in the ditch to get around me,''
Homan said. ''It's definitely getting worse. The traffic has picked
up a lot more. And everybody tends to push the pedal.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Billman, director of safety programs for the Ohio Farm
Bureau, said most farm vehicles can go no faster than 20 mph but
need to use rural highways. Driving them on the side of the road is
usually not an option because of ditches, mailboxes and private
property, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem occurs when the farmer and the motorist
become irate at the same time. ''It ends up being a situation very
similar to road rage,'' Billman said.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's Field said he has noticed more ''Tractor Ahead''
warning signs in his travels around the country. Manufacturers also
are starting to place turn signals higher on farm vehicles so
motorists can see them better, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pope Honors Modern-Day Heroes  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Choosing as his backdrop the Colosseum, the ancient
arena associated with Christianity's first martyrs, Pope John Paul
II paid tribute to those who suffered for the faith in some of the
20th century's cruelest places, among them Soviet gulags, Nazi
extermination camps and Chinese forced labor factories.
</P>
<P>
   As Christianity begins its third millennium, John Paul is
worried that faith might be weakening, and he wanted Sunday night's
ceremony at the Roman monument to give Christians fresh examples of
courageous faithful from modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 20th century, and maybe even more than in the first
period of Christianity, there has been a vast number of men and
women who bore witness to the faith through sufferings that were
often heroic,'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope invited members from other Christian denominations to
join him in the tribute. Orthodox, Anglicans and many Protestant
representatives participated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Countless numbers refused to yield to the cult of false gods
of the 20th century and were sacrificed by Communism, Nazism, by
the idolatry of state or race,'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican did not make public a list of 12,000 names sent in
by bishops throughout the world as candidates to be honored.
Reportedly on the list are Baptist Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the
slain American civil rights leader, and an Italian priest, Giuseppe
Puglisi, who was killed by the Sicilian Mafia after speaking out
against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, whose voice often sounded slurred during the 2{-
hour-long service, used one hand to cradle his head as he listened
to accounts of persecution from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The account of a seminarian in Burundi who survived a 1997
massacre at a seminary in which 40 colleagues were killed was among
the most vivid: ''As we lay in the blood, we prayed and begged
pardon. 'Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are
doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Trappist priest stepped forward to tell of a 1996 massacre in
an Algerian monastery during that North African nation's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A prayer was also said for Oscar Romero, the Salvadoran
archbishop who was assassinated in 1980 after delivering a sermon
asking the military to halt its repressive tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his years preparing for the priesthood as a young
man in Poland during World War II, John Paul said: ''I myself am a
witness of much pain and many trials,'' and he noted that in Dachau
concentration camp alone, 3,000 priests were interned.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Christians honored on Sunday the pope said: ''The names
of many are unknown; the names of some have been denigrated by
their persecutors, who tried to add disgrace to martyrdom; the
names of others have been concealed by their executioners.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope mentioned two modern martyrs by name: Orthodox
Metropolitan Benjamin, from St. Petersburg, martyred in 1922 in the
upheaval that followed the Russian Revolution, and Lutheran Pastor
Paul Schneider, who spoke of his faith to those guarding his cell
in Buchenwald concentration camp.

<HEADLINE> Child of Wartime Rape Seeking Home  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- It's hard to imagine that no one in
Kosovo wants to adopt Arta.
</P>
<P>
   This healthy 3-month-old with pale blue eyes kicks up her toes
when strangers enter the maternity ward at Prizren's hospital,
gurgling cheerfully and grabbing outstretched fingers. She
recognizes the nurses that hover around her white steel crib making
faces, rewarding them with an open toothless smile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, prospective parents pass her by. After all, her history
is known: She is the daughter of an ethnic Albanian teen-ager raped
by a Serb soldier during Kosovo's war.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's father snatched Arta from her weeping
17-year-old mother's bed soon after she was born. Without
discussion, he signed the papers that put her up for adoption and
pointedly told Dr. Fellanza Gjergjizi that she was a child of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Arta was not welcome under his roof, and during the months
since, it has become clear that the only place she is wanted is
this hospital 55 miles south of the capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one really wants these children,'' Gjergjizi said. ''They
say, 'Who knows about the father?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers like Corey Levine of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe describe Kosovo's children of
rape as a ''lost group.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Communities are not going to accept them -- nobody is going to
accept them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how many children resulted from rapes
committed during Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign
of repression in this southern province, a crackdown that ended
after a 78-day NATO air campaign and the arrival of peacekeepers in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Even discounting the fact that the rapist in this case was a
Serb, hated by most ethnic Albanians, the stigma attached to rape
is so strong -- particularly in Kosovo's rural hinterlands -- that
few women will ever reveal they were attacked, much less that a
child resulted. Abortion is available here, and human rights
workers say women have taken advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rights workers point to anecdotal evidence that the
children of rape are out there. Some of the evidence comes from
scattered reports of abandoned infants -- virtually unknown before
the war in this society where extended families traditionally step
in to provide care for children if anything happens to their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. police have noted a handful of cases in recent weeks. In
the capital, Pristina, the U.S. humanitarian group Save the
Children said the main hospital held 24 abandoned children at one
point after the end of the bloodshed, though only nine now remain.
</P>
<P>
   At Prizren's hospital, Gjergjizi said that before the war, she
might have a single case of an abandoned child all year. Since
then, though, she's had nine instances in which mothers simply left
the hospital after giving birth, walking away without a word -- and
without their infant.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the babies, the hospital was able to find adoptive
parents because pediatricians could honestly say they had no
details about the conception.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by the teen-ager's father is what makes Arta's
case different from the 3-week-old girl that lies in the
neighboring crib. For the other girl, no background was offered by
the mother before she left the child behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not her fault that she was born into this situation,''
Gjergjizi said of Arta.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses in Prizren like Lulijeta Bajra, Lule Krasniqi and Igballe
Gygjin have been doing their best to be surrogate mothers, offering
a simple hug to the little girl whose home for now is at the end of
the row by the door.
</P>
<P>
   The other infants may sleep in bare cribs, but Arta's has
decorations: a pink bunny, a purple and green elephant, and a
garland of plastic teething toys. Her crib is also the only one
with a name -- a piece of masking tape with 'Arta' written in large
block letters. She gets to squirm in footed pajamas decorated with
blue kittens. The other kids just get wrapped in white blankets.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses can only offer the little signs of affection, though,
and know their long-term patient should move out soon. Gjergjizi
hopes that Arta can find a home abroad, far from the stigma that
would cloud her future here.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone wants her, please take her, because no one here
will,'' Gjergjizi said. ''She would have a better life outside
Kosovo. No one will know what happened. It's better that way.''

<HEADLINE> Depressed Men Face Heart Risks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- New research gives depressed men something else
to lament: They face an increased risk of dying from heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   While previous research has shown that depression in men and
women is linked to heart disease, a study published in today's
Archives of Internal Medicine found that only men faced an
increased risk of heart disease-related death.
</P>
<P>
   The authors analyzed data from 5,007 women and 2,886 men
enrolled in a 10-year national health and nutrition survey who
initially did not have heart disease. About one-sixth of the women
and one-tenth of the men had clinical depression at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Non-fatal heart disease symptoms occurred in 187 men and 187
women, while 137 women and 129 men died of heart disease-related
causes during the study period.
</P>
<P>
   While the depressed women faced a 73 percent higher
heart-disease risk than non-depressed women, they were not at
greater risk of dying. Among men, those with depression had a 71
percent higher heart-disease risk and were 2.34 times more likely
to die of heart disease than non-depressed men.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have shown that the effect of depression on coronary heart
disease risk differs in men and women,'' wrote the authors, led by
researcher Amy Ferketich of Ohio State University. The reasons for
the difference are unclear, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Depression was measured only at the outset, a major limitation
of the study since it's unknown if some patients developed the
ailment during the study period, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Though they didn't study how depression affected the heart,
previous research has shown that stress hormones that may be
activated in depression can constrict blood vessels and may lead to
artery blockage.

<HEADLINE> James Smithson's Surprising Will  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Englishman's gold that founded the
Smithsonian Institution seemed at times like a castle in the air --
illusive, vaporous, hard to hold on to.
</P>
<P>
   John Quincy Adams said the whole project was as exasperating as
trying to extract something of enduring value from the fangs of a
rattlesnake.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperating, but worth the effort. ''To furnish the means of
acquiring knowledge is ... the greatest benefit that can be
conferred upon mankind,'' the former president wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle took more than a decade to unravel. In July 1835, the
American envoy in London received a copy of an astounding will,
written by James Smithson. It bequeathed an estate valued at a
then-staggering $500,000 to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson was the illegitimate son of an English duke and a
scientific researcher of some repute. He never crossed the
Atlantic, had no known ties to the United States and died in Genoa,
Italy, in 1829. His money came from the estate of his wealthy
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson's will, triggered because his nephew and first heir had
died childless, directed that his estate be used ''to found at
Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an
Establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has a gift horse been examined so skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen argued there was nothing in the Constitution to
permit taking such a gift. Some said democratic America should not
be the steppingstone to immortality for any foreigner. Some called
Smithson a ''whippersnapper vagabond'' acting out of ''posthumous
vanity.'' Sen. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina thought it
''beneath the dignity of the United States to receive presents of
this kind from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the nation should be honored that a native of a
''monarchial country'' should have made the United States the
object of his benevolence.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson found his champion in John Quincy Adams, who had served
as the sixth president of the United States. By then a member of
the House of Representatives, Adams persuaded Congress to accept
Smithson's half-million dollars, a fortune in the late 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   But the second set of questions proved more difficult: What on
earth to do with all that money? What exactly did Smithson mean by
''increase and diffusion?'' And what kind of knowledge did he have
in mind?
</P>
<P>
   Smithson had not spelled it out. Lawmakers could only guess, and
advance their own pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   There were no lack of suggestions. Adams favored a national
observatory, a ''lighthouse in the sky,'' to search out the secrets
of the universe. Others wanted a national university, an
agricultural school, a lecture bureau, an experimental farm, a
publishing house for scientific tracts, a natural history museum, a
chemical laboratory, a teachers college, a botanical garden, a
library or a supply of inexpensive books for primary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Adams opposed any use of the Smithson money for schools or
teachers, saying American children should not be educated with
''foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would rather see ''the whole money thrown into the
Potomac'' than used in such a way.
</P>
<P>
   Adams almost got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson's estate had been converted into English gold coins,
which were shipped to the United States in sacks, melted down and
reminted into American $10 gold pieces. These were invested in
bonds of two new states, Arkansas and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad investment; the two states quickly defaulted on the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress would have let the whole affair die at that
point. Why should their constituents pay for the federal
government's bad investments? they asked.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including Sen. Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, said
that having accepted Smithson's money, the United States now had a
moral obligation to carry out his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was settled by act of Congress in August 1846. The
lost money was replenished by the federal Treasury. The Smithsonian
Institution was established. It would include at first a museum for
national collections, a library, a laboratory and an art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of its future was left open-ended. The institution
itself would decide just how best to provide for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge with a minimum of congressional
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Adams had no doubt the Smithsonian had been set on the right
path.
</P>
<P>
   ''To what higher or nobler object could this generous and
splendid donation have been devoted?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> 'Gladiator' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For movie-goers, all roads led to Rome and
''Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Ridley Scott's spectacle of ancient Roman gore and
glory topped the box office with $32.7 million in its opening
weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The movie starring
Russell Crowe grossed more than the next six movies combined.
</P>
<P>
   ''U-571,'' the top movie for the previous two weekends, dropped
to second place with $7.6 million. The sci-fi thriller
''Frequency'' remained at No. 3 in its second weekend with $6.5
million, while ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' slipped two
spots to No. 4 with $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Gladiator,'' Hollywood's first Roman epic since the 1960s,
Crowe stars as a general who falls into slavery but uses his combat
skills to become a hero gladiator and seek revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Using digital effects, the movie recreates Roman pageantry on a
level that dwarfs such classics as ''Ben-Hur'' and ''Spartacus.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real Roman epic, the kind of spectacle that hasn't
been made in 30-plus years,'' said Jim Tharp, head of distribution
for DreamWorks, which released ''Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie did not approach any records by other pre-summer
blockbusters that had PG or PG-13 ratings. With an R rating and a
running time of 2 hours, 30 minutes, DreamWorks ''thought it would
be very difficult to hit $30 million'' in the opening weekend,
Tharp said.
</P>
<P>
   ''DreamWorks really built up excitement for this movie,'' said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor
Relations. ''The trailers they showed were very effective in
getting audiences psyched, and the movie had all the elements
people were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other big new movie, Kim Basinger's ''I Dreamed of
Africa,'' was a bust with $2.5 million for eighth place. Based on a
real story, the movie follows a woman's adventures and heartbreaks
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in 2,112 theaters, ''I Dreamed of Africa'' averaged a
weak $1,184 per cinema, compared with $11,130 in 2,938 theaters for
''Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Kim got very good reviews, but unfortunately, the film as a
whole did not,'' said Ed Russell, executive vice president for
publicity at Sony, which released ''I Dreamed of Africa.'' ''Adult,
female films like this are really driven by good, solid reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Gladiator,'' $32.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''U-571,'' $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Frequency,'' $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Where the Heart Is,'' $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Love and Basketball,'' $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Keeping the Faith,'' $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''I Dreamed of Africa,'' $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Rules of Engagement,'' $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''28 Days,'' $2.35 million.

<HEADLINE> Editors, Publishers To Meet in NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Member publishers and editors of The Associated
Press gathered today for a report on the news cooperative, a panel
on the 2000 election and talks by Vice President Al Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting and luncheon are attended by executives
representing AP's 1,546 member newspapers. They are the major
events of the first full day of activities of the Newspaper
Association of America's convention.
</P>
<P>
   AP chairman Donald E. Newhouse was to call the meeting to order
and president and chief executive officer Louis D. Boccardi was to
report on the state of AP.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also will include the announcement of election
results for the board of directors, held by all-mail balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi also was to moderate a discussion of political
campaigns with three AP correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the news cooperative also were expected to hear
from Alan Diaz, the photographer who took the AP photographs inside
the house where 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez was seized by federal
agents late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, titled ''A Conversation: Campaign 2000,'' includes
Walter Mears, AP vice president and Washington columnist; Ron
Fournier, chief political writer in Washington; and Marc A.
Humbert, New York State political editor based in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scheduled to speak after the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was the featured speaker at the luncheon following the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There were 10 candidates for six board seats -- five full 3-year
terms and the one year remaining when a member stepped down. Two
candidates ran in a separate election to represent a city of less
than 50,000 population.

<HEADLINE> Judges Prepare To Hear Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The frenzy surrounding Elian Gonzalez is expected
to take a decidedly dry turn this week as the international custody
case goes before the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel is being asked to decide whether the
6-year-old Cuban boy should receive a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than playing on the emotions that have led to protests
across two countries since Elian was discovered floating off the
Florida coast Thanksgiving Day, experts say lawyers will be arguing
the nuts and bolts of law at Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Outsiders often find these arguments very dry,'' said Richard
Freer, a law professor at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no jury so there's no playing of the violin, there's
nobody to make cry,'' Freer said. ''That doesn't mean there's no
emotional appeal sometimes, but this is all about what the law
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges are under no deadline for ruling in the legal battle
that has pitted the boy's Miami relatives against his Cuban father
and the U.S. government. The 136-seat courtroom is expected to be
filled anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, are not required to
attend, and it's unlikely they will. Three of the boy's Miami
relatives -- cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez, 21, and great-uncles
Lazaro and Delfin Gonzalez -- plan to be in the courtroom but won't
be allowed to speak during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel that they need to be there,'' said Armando
Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives. ''This is a very
important point for the them. The government has not listened.
Maybe this court will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives appealed after a lower court threw out a
request for political asylum signed by Elian and filed by Lazaro
Gonzalez. Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he wants to take his son
home to Cuba, and the U.S. government has backed his right to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The government has agreed to give five of its allotted 20
minutes to Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to
argue that the father should be able to represent Elian if an
asylum hearing is granted. The remaining 15 minutes will be used by
government lawyers arguing that the 6-year-old is too young to
apply for asylum without an adult acting in his best interest, and
that that adult is his father, not his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge in Miami had dismissed the asylum petition
because of the boy's age, but the 11th Circuit Court, in agreeing
to hear the appeal, said laws passed by Congress say any alien can
apply for U.S. asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crucial moment for Elian Gonzalez and any others to
have a voice when asking for political asylum,'' said Ramon Saul
Sanchez, a Cuban-American community leader in Miami. ''Everybody is
looking at Atlanta as a decisive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said some Cuban-Americans in Miami had talked of a
caravan to Atlanta to demonstrate outside the courthouse the day of
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have discouraged that because we don't want to look like we
are putting any type of pressure on the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the hearing is expected to take only 40 minutes, a ruling
could take several weeks. But Freer said the case is on an
''expedited appeal track'' and an opinion is likely sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   The court has ordered that Elian remain in the United States
until the judges rule on his appeal. Since federal agents removed
him from his great-uncle's Miami home April 22, Elian has been
staying with his father, stepmother and 6-month-old half-brother at
a secluded plantation in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Serious Crime Decline Continues  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With serious crime down 7 percent last year,
the nation is eight years into its longest-running crime decline on
record, but experts see signs that a bottoming-out is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary figures for crimes reported to police in 1999
extended a trend begun in 1992, the FBI said Sunday. That
eight-year crime decline is now nearly three times longer than the
second-longest decline -- the three years from 1982 through 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But a slowing in 1999 of the crime decline in the nation's
largest cities was seen by Professor Alfred Blumstein of
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and other academic
specialists as a reminder that crime cannot decline forever. ''They
(major cities) are the leaders both on the way up and on the way
down,'' Blumstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report said all seven major types of crime were down not
only nationwide but also in each region of the nation, and in
suburbs, rural areas and in cities of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault were down a combined 7 percent, led by murder and robbery,
both down 8 percent. Rape and assault were down 7 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   The property crimes of burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft
also were down a combined 7 percent, led by an 11 percent decline
in burglary. Auto theft was down 8 percent, larceny-theft 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blumstein said the record eight-year decline ''may be finally
undoing the great rise in crime of the late 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's longest and steepest crime rise -- increases of 10.2
to 13.8 percent from 1965 through 1969 -- came as baby boomers
reached the crime-prone ages of 15 to 25 and ''civil rights and
Vietnam War protests increased distrust of government,'' Blumstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that crime trends may soon flatten out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, murder, the most fully reported crime, was down 2
percent in cities over 500,000 population, but fell by between 7
percent and 14 percent in smaller cities, 12 percent in suburbs and
17 percent in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Blumstein, Professor James Alan Fox of Northeastern
University in Boston noted smaller crime declines in the largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will be the first to reach the bottom,'' Fox said,
pointing out that murders in New York actually rose a bit in 1999,
from 633 to 671.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge is to be sure the numbers don't go back up to
any great degree,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's record prison population provides only ''temporary
relief,'' he added, ''because those people will come out of prison
and many will still have inadequate skills and bad attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said, ''Now is not the time to
become complacent. ... Let's try harder. We must redouble our
efforts by providing alternatives to crime as well as tough
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans pointed proudly to anti-crime measures
they had championed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the report ''confirms that our anti-crime
strategy -- more police officers on the beat, fewer illegal guns and
violent criminals on the street -- is having a powerful impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the House crime
subcommittee, gave credit to strategies developed by local
governments in community policing for which Clinton won federal
funding. But he highlighted a GOP-sponsored law he said has induced
27 states to impose longer prison terms to get more federal money
to build prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
the results ''were largely due to the leadership at the state,
local and federal level of Republicans committed to arresting,
prosecuting and incarcerating violent criminals.'' GOP-backed
legislation has provided $700 million a year for prison
construction, Hatch noted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said further progress could come from passing his
remaining gun-control measures, like child-safety locks and
background checks on gun buyers at gun shows. Hatch, reflecting GOP
opposition that has blocked those measures, noted the crime
reductions came without enacting Clinton's remaining gun proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Academic experts credited both parties' favorite anti-crime
nostrums but also a wider range of factors, including some beyond
the control of politicians, such as the aging of the baby boomers
past crime-prone years.
</P>
<P>
   To that list, Fox added ''evaporating crack cocaine markets and
the violent crack gangs that drove the numbers up in the 1980s,
smarter policing, increased interest in prevention down to the
grass roots, and a better economy giving cities more to invest in
crime control'' and providing jobs for some who might otherwise
turn to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI figures come from more than 17,000 U.S. police agencies
and extend back to 1960.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Ho-Hum Over Biotech Foods  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Europeans and Japanese don't want gene-altered
crops. Frito-Lay, McDonald's and Gerber have rejected them, too.
But grocers say American consumers don't seem to care one way or
the other -- at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a non-issue. They're not even thinking about it,'' said
Richard Ramsey, who runs a Piggly Wiggly supermarket in
Blountstown, Fla. ''I've not heard anything,'' said Dave Eber, who
manages a Marsh store in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   However, support for crops that produce genetically engineered
food is slipping, even if a majority of consumers still back the
technology, according to a poll released at the supermarket
industry's annual convention, which opened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of shoppers surveyed in January said they
would be very or somewhat likely to buy a new variety of produce
that had been genetically engineered to resist insect damage.
That's down from 77 percent in a similar poll four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four percent said in January they were very or somewhat
likely to buy produce that was modified to taste better or stay
fresh longer, compared with 58 percent in 1996. The new survey,
conducted by Research International USA for the Food Marketing
Institute, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the poll's findings said ''consumers are less
inclined to purchase these products'' than they were in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The government has approved approximately 50 varieties of
genetically engineered crops, and gene-altered soybeans and corn
can be found in foods throughout the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of this year's soybean crop and 20 percent of
this year's corn plantings will be of biotech varieties that are
resistant to a popular herbicide or insect pests. Biotech animals,
including leaner hogs and fast-growing salmon, are in development.
</P>
<P>
   A few food processors, including Frito-Lay and Gerber, have
stopped buying genetically engineered ingredients, citing fears
about consumer resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, however, don't realize how widely used these
so-called biotech ingredients have become, said Thomas Hoban, a
North Carolina State University sociologist who tracks consumer
attitudes about food. Nearly four in 10 questioned in the January
poll said they had heard nothing about biotech food.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, ''not only has the support for food and agricultural
biotechnology gone down but also support for medical biotechnology.
... The U.S. is maybe overly positive. It will swing down, maybe,''
Hoban said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who don't want to eat biotech food are expected to
provide a boost to the $6 billion-a-year organic industry. The lone
major grocery chain to reject biotech food so far is Whole Foods
Market, which focuses on natural foods and stands to gain if
consumers turn away from gene-altered products.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech food ''is not as much of an issue nationally as it will
become,'' said James Hopper, senior vice president of natural food
group operations for Tree of Life Inc. of St. Augustine, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who are aware of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
and don't want to be exposed to GMOs will definitely go to
organic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Agah, who designs supermarkets for the 97-store Save Mart
chain in northern California, isn't so sure. What matters most to
consumers is the price and appearance of their food, he said.
Organic food usually costs more than the conventional variety.
</P>
<P>
   ''They like to talk about (organic food), but they don't buy
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the biotech industry say there isn't enough known
about the possible environmental or health risks from genetically
altered plants and animals. They have been demanding tougher
testing standards and mandatory labeling of the products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration last week announced several steps
meant to assure the public that biotech food is safe, including a
more formal process for reviewing new products. But it said
mandatory labeling was not warranted. Food manufacturers fear such
labels would scare away consumers.

<HEADLINE> Fire Shuts Down Los Alamos Lab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE ROCK, N.M. (AP) -- A fire intended to improve the watershed
in Bandelier National Monument was burning out of control late
Sunday near Los Alamos, shutting down the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see the flames up in the mountains,'' said Edwina
Cisneros, who was evacuated from a mobile home park where she was
visiting her parents. ''It didn't look that far away, so we were
pretty scared.''
</P>
<P>
   No injuries had been reported from that fire or another blaze in
south-central New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lab spokesman John Gustafson said the blaze had spread to Water
Canyon on the lab's western boundary near a work site. The site is
where much of the lab's work with high explosives is conducted, but
officials said all explosives had been put in fire-resistant
bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire has not approached any areas where
radioactive materials are stored.

   ''It is not close enough to'' threaten any structures, Gustafson
said. ''But it's close enough (for us) to take some precautionary
moves.''
</P>
<P>
   A news release from the lab said only workers engaged in
emergency response or other critical activities should report to
work Monday.

<P>
   Cisneros, a bank teller in Los Alamos who was with her
2-year-old son Kyle, was sent to the White Rock Baptist Church to
join about a dozen other evacuees. Pastor Chuck McCullough said the
church can hold about 200 people and will refer the people to
church families.
</P>
<P>
   The Bandelier fire, about 70 miles north of Albuquerque, has
burned about 1,000 acres, said State Forestry Division spokeswoman
Terri Wildermuth. Residents in western Los Alamos and some campers
were asked to leave the area.
</P>
<P>
   The monument is known for its ancient Indian dwellings and
artifacts. The National Park Service had planned to burn about 900
acres in the area, but dry, windy conditions pushed it out of
control. It was subdued Saturday, but shifting winds reignited the
blaze Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In south-central New Mexico, another fire in Ruidoso burned an
estimated 400 acres and forced the evacuation of about 150 homes on
Sunday, said Lincoln Zone Interagency Prevention Team spokeswoman
Gwen Shaffer. Winds were blowing the fire away from town, but it
did destroy at least three homes.

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus Projections Look Big  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chalk up another effect of the sizzling
economy: The federal budget is so flush that there should be plenty
of money for lawmakers' election-year spending demands without fear
of dipping into Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about eroding Social Security surpluses limited the
spending President Clinton and Congress approved last year. Now,
budget surplus projections look so big that Republicans could give
Clinton every extra penny he wants -- about $20 billion more than
they prefer -- and still not fret about draining Social Security's
trust funds, which both parties have put off-limits in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   As congressional committees resume writing fiscal 2001 spending
bills this week, it is clear Clinton won't get everything he wants.
But Republicans seem likely to pierce the spending limits they
promised in the budget they pushed through Congress last month,
either by ignoring them or using accounting gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal conservatives concede that without the pressure of
leaving Social Security alone, they can do little to stop a
bipartisan, election-year spending binge.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a handful of us who will throw our bodies in front of
the train, but there will be little hope we will slow that train
down,'' said Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts predict that official estimates to be updated this
summer will project a surplus of $40 billion or more, excluding
Social Security, in fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. That is
easily enough to accommodate the extra spending desired by Clinton
and many lawmakers of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   The plentiful cash should help Republicans achieve their goal:
cast themselves as frugal alternatives to Clinton and Democrats,
then reach the compromises needed to quickly finish the 13 annual
spending bills for various government operations so lawmakers can
go home early for re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer amount of money -- and the lack of the Social Security
factor this year -- is also a tempting kitty.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all this money, it's an automobile without brakes,'' said
Marshall Wittmann, who analyzes Congress for the conservative
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the one-third of the $1.8 trillion budget that
finances programs from soil conservation to space shots --
everything but automatic federal payments such as Social Security
benefits and interest to people holding Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to hold such spending in 2001 to $605 billion,
while Clinton proposes $625 billion. Within those sums, the GOP is
earmarking $4 billion more than the president for defense, while he
seeks $24 billion more than Republicans for domestic and foreign
aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Republicans would underfund education, environment
and other programs in their drive for a tax cut of at least $150
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only place you can look for more money is to do away with
those tax cuts,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., told Republicans at a
Senate Appropriations Committee meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the tax cuts are enacted -- and most are certain to
be vetoed by Clinton -- there would probably still be enough money
to pay for extra spending, either from the surplus or by using
well-worn gimmicks like delaying some spending into the early days
of fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the widespread belief that more money will be found,
Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told his
panel last week not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we ought to say this (difference between Clinton
and Republicans) is an impossible cliff we are running up against
and won't get to the top of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Social Security issue, many conservatives are
searching for new ways to hold down spending.
</P>
<P>
   Some are considering a push to also put Medicare surpluses
politically out of bounds. That could have political appeal similar
to Social Security because the health insurance program for the
elderly also faces demographic pressures from the approaching
retirement of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   But Medicare's trust fund surpluses are much smaller than Social
Security's, averaging a bit over $20 billion annually. That would
have some impact next year, but little over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, conservatives are still searching for ways to keep
the pressure on spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't done as good a job as we need to arguing why we
don't want to increase spending in its own right,'' said Rep.
Patrick Toomey, R-Pa.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Refugees Brace for Hardship  </HEADLINE>
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Dinh Thi Yen, born nine years ago in Hong Kong,
speaks perfect Cantonese, the territory's official dialect. But her
classmates never let her forget she doesn't belong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids beat me up at school because I'm Vietnamese,'' the
second-grader says.
</P>
<P>
   Thi Yen has grown up in the Pillar Point refugee camp,
surrounded by barbed-wire and close to drab warehouses and a
dockyard in a remote corner of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The government is closing the camp May 31, but the refugees
regard that as a mixed blessing. The closure will force 1,100
Vietnamese residents out into the mainstream of Hong Kong, with its
notoriously steep rents and its market for unskilled labor
particularly tight as the territory recovers from a bruising
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The government calls the closure a ''humanitarian solution,''
for both the refugees and their Hong Kong-born children, who have
known no home but the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is better for them to be able to integrate into the
society,'' says Brenda Ku, a camp supervisor with Caritas-Hong
Kong, the Roman Catholic charity that runs Pillar Point. ''They
would really welcome the new policy if they didn't have to worry
about potential financial problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing the camp, which is free to refugees, will officially end
the odyssey of Hong Kong's boat people, the Vietnamese who began
fleeing their homeland when the communist North defeated the
U.S.-backed South in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million Vietnamese fled to neighboring countries on foot
or by boat to escape political persecution and poverty. Hong Kong,
then a British colony, gave unconditional asylum to people awaiting
resettlement in the West until 1988, when it added a screening
process to separate political and economic refugees. The latter
were eventually sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Phan Thi Van's family pawned six gold rings for her 20-day
passage with 40 strangers in a rickety fishing junk on the high
seas in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   She was detained as an economic refugee, an illegal immigrant,
but before she could be deported, Phan married a political refugee
and gained the right to stay in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Now 30, Phan says she and her three children -- ages 1 to 6 --
will have to rely solely on her husband's income as a part-time
construction worker when they leave the camp. And they don't know
where they will live.
</P>
<P>
   A camp bulletin board offers neat rows of notices for low-paying
construction and factory jobs and tiny apartments. One hardly pays
for the other. Factory workers typically earn $500 to 1,000 a
month, but monthly rents for one-bedroom apartments in urban areas
are at least $1,000. Even in outlying districts, small apartments
run close to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Phan's husband takes home the equivalent of $230 each day he
works, but he usually gets only four or five days of work a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried sick. But what can I do?'' Phan says. ''I can't
work because I have to look after the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial worries are not the refugees' only concerns as they
prepare to leave the camp's familiar confines. Discrimination
against the Vietnamese and other migrants such as Filipinos and
Indians is rife in Hong Kong. Refugees complain that shopkeepers
are rude, and the media often poke fun at them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local kids don't play with me,'' Thi Yen says casually as she
dances around a wooden pushcart with her friends.
</P>
<P>
   The government is granting residency rights to the displaced
camp occupants. They had already been free to leave the camp and
work outside, but many chose to stay, despite the camp's
inconvenient location and occasional violence.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the mid-1990s, 5,000 people were packed into the
two- and three-story barracks. Crime was common, and the close
quarters led to sporadic brawls, especially between south and north
Vietnamese. Last June, eight people were injured and a building was
set on fire by a gasoline bomb in a clash at Pillar Point.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter visited recently, the camp was clean and
orderly. Children played tag and soccer while men chatted outside
their houses. Vietnamese music with operatic vocals drifted from
barrack windows. Aromas of sizzling Vietnamese eggrolls and
dumplings filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 223,000 Vietnamese refugees have passed through Hong Kong
since the war ended in 1975. About 144,000 gained asylum abroad,
mostly in the United States, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong granted permanent status to some, but mounting
political pressure and financial strain forced the government to
scrap its asylum policy in 1998. It closed government-run camps and
sent most of the remaining refugees back to Vietnam if they
couldn't show that would put them at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Most Vietnamese still stranded in Hong Kong are classified as
political refugees and theoretically qualify for political asylum
abroad. But realistically, few have prospects of resettling because
they have no relatives to sponsor them or they have criminal
records and drug abuse problems.

<HEADLINE> Expedition Hopes To Raise Submarine  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- On the night of Feb. 17, 1864, a
weird-looking vessel, the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley,
slipped through the waves toward the picket line of Union ships
blockading Charleston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-cranked vessel, crafted of locomotive boilers and
carrying a crew of nine, rammed a spar with a black powder charge
into the wooden hull of the Union blockade ship Housatonic. A
crewman set off the charge and history was made.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunley -- named after New Orleans lawyer Horace Lawson
Hunley, who financed it -- became the first submarine to sink an
enemy warship. But after signaling to shore, the sub also sank,
coming to rest on the muddy bottom off Sullivans Island outside the
harbor's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Hunley is coming home.
</P>
<P>
   A dive team funded by author Clive Cussler found the Hunley in
1995, intact, save for some minor damage. Later this month, work
begins to raise the sub from its watery grave.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has earmarked $3 million, with $2 million more
from a Defense Department program, to help bring the Hunley back to
shore and start restoration work. The total cost of recovering and
preserving the sub is estimated at $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to try to bring up a ship totally intact with a
human crew aboard and bring it up in the exact position it was
sitting on the bottom,'' said state Sen. Glenn McConnell, chairman
of the state Hunley Commission overseeing the project.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to mark the start of the expedition Friday, with
the first boats heading to the recovery site a few days later. The
plan is to raise the Hunley by July 17, before the height of the
hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck is covered by about three feet of sediment in about 30
feet of water. It weighs an estimated eight tons with sediment
inside and came to rest at a 45-degree angle. It will have to be
raised at that angle to keep it from breaking apart.
</P>
<P>
   Divers working in water with near-zero visibility first will
sink hollow pilings on either end and attach a steel truss
lengthwise above the 40-foot-long vessel.
</P>
<P>
   As the sub is uncovered a section at a time, belts attached to
the truss will be slung beneath the Hunley every two feet.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid foam cushions will cradle it in the slings and then the
entire steel superstructure, with the Hunley beneath, will be
raised, put on a barge and pulled up the Cooper River to a
46,000-square-foot conservation building at the old Charleston Navy
Base.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a daunting task to raise a vessel intact,'' said
Maria Jacobsen, head archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   The sediment covering has helped preserve the sub and previous
dives indicate the wrought iron plates appear to be in good shape,
chief conservator Paul Mardikian said.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said tests show the hull is a uniform half-inch thick.
A small window is broken, which allowed the sediment in, but that
was the only major damage readily apparent, he said. Why the sub
sank remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Divers found seams on the submarine were flush, not overlapping,
indicating ''construction far more advanced than anyone thought,''
McConnell said. ''We're dealing with a submarine that was very
hydrodynamically designed and 50 years ahead of its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising money for the complete restoration has stalled for now.
Friends of the Hunley, which had raised about $2.1 million in cash
and other donations, recently suspended fund-raising while debate
raged in the Legislature about the Confederate flag atop the South
Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In that climate, businesses felt donations to help raise a
Confederate submarine ''might be misinterpreted,'' spokesman Mark
Regalbuto said.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation building, part of which became a sound stage
for last year's television movie ''The Hunley,'' could be the
submarine's home for as long as a decade. Once it gets there, the
Hunley will immediately put in a tank of chilled water to prevent
corrosion and deterioration of any remains inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key thing is to very quickly, within 12 hours of raising
the sub, bring it here and put it in the tank and seal it with
water,'' Mardikian said. ''Then you can breathe and say, 'We've got
time to see what we've got.'''
</P>
<P>
   Any crewmen's remains will be buried with military honors in the
Hunley plot of Charleston's Magnolia Cemetery near the graves of
two other crews who died during the sub's testing.
</P>
<P>
   Once preserved, the Hunley will be displayed in a new wing at
the Charleston Museum, a few miles from where the Civil War began
with the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston
Harbor.

<HEADLINE> Skateboarding Goes Mainstream  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBRIDGE, Va. (AP) -- Skateboarder Nathan Hauk was so desperate
to visit the world's largest indoor skatepark that he hawked a
stack of his favorite video games to raise some quick cash.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got up at dawn and drove three hours from the suburbs of
Philadelphia to get in a full day on the ramps, rails and empty
swimming pools of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard about it, I knew I had to get here,'' Hauk, 20,
said as he dripped sweat following a workout on the pool's
8-foot-high walls.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest fantasy playground for the modern
skateboarder: The 61,640-square-foot Vans Skatepark, which opened
last month at the Potomac Mills Mall.
</P>
<P>
   As communities across the country ban skateboarding in town
squares and on city streets, skateboard retailers Vans Inc. has
brought the streets indoors -- and to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Skaters who honed their skills flying off courthouse steps and
scraping across park benches can challenge the kidney-shaped pool,
the 40-foot-wide halfpipe, or the simulated street course with
stairs, ledges and benches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so much like the street it's unbelievable,'' Hauk said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an added benefit: ''No cops,'' said Jordan Wegner,
15, of Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Once an outlaw sport, skateboarding has gone corporate
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million park, the fourth and largest to be built by Vans
opened April 15, following others in Orange, Bakersfield and
Ontario, Calif. Vans plans to open more parks in Milpitas, Calif.,
Houston, Westminster, Colo., Orlando, Fla., Detroit and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Skateboarding has become a multibillion-dollar industry with its
own glossy magazines, fashions, touring competitions and stores,
said Neal Lyons, president of Vans' retail division.
</P>
<P>
   Vans, based in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Fe Springs, has
126 retail outlets across the country that sell sneakers, baggy
shorts and all the other gear necessary to be a fashionable
skatepunk.
</P>
<P>
   Top-notch skating facilities were a logical step, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids are sick of just playing baseball or football or
basketball,'' Lyons said. ''The whole alternative sports movement
is dominant in youth culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Skateboarding is no passing fancy and the sport will continue to
grow along with other ''extreme sports'' such as snowboarding, said
Steven Marotta, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon at the Woodbridge park, the crowds picked
up after school let out.
</P>
<P>
   Posters of skateboarders engaged in various gravity-defying
feats adorned the walls. Music from bands such as Metallica and
Nine Inch Nails blared as errant skateboards clattered and clanged
away from tumbling skaters.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls -- none of whom were seen skating on this
afternoon -- hung out on benches nearby and flirted with pierced and
tattooed skater hunks.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your parents' roller rink.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a few bold moms and dads -- whose children had yet to
reach the age where they are embarrassed by their parents -- hung
out and watched.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Heard of Falls Church brought her 13-year-old son,
Robert, to the park because she liked the policy requiring helmets
and pads. She also liked the fact it was at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can watch him or I can go shopping,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Hitting His Marks for TV  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The forward hatch of Air Force Two operates a
bit like a stage curtain: On the outer side of the threshold, Al
Gore is in pressed pants and hairspray. Inside, the man the Secret
Service code-named ''Sundance'' pads about in flip-flops and short
shorts, with a briefing book or cold Heineken in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Those who hold backstage passes to Campaign 2000 hear the
question a lot: What's Gore really like? Glimpses behind the
curtain offer some surprising answers -- like goofy.
</P>
<P>
   In a receiving line of VIPs at the snowy Rochester, N.Y.,
airport, the vice president encountered the insolent pout of
2-year-old Emily Forth. Instead of saying hello and moving on, Gore
mimicked her pose -- eyes narrowed, lower lip stuck out -- and made a
game of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to count to 10,'' he told the tot, as nervous pilots
waited to get him aboard to begin deicing. ''I bet I can make you
smile before I get to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's playfully stern stare, Emily made it to four before
dissolving in a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Before speeches, Gore regularly does an offstage shuffling dance
-- to loosen up, he explained to aides. In private, he sings country
tunes on-key but with such an exaggerated twang that he can sound
like a baying hound dog.
</P>
<P>
   A master practical joker, Gore approved the wallpapering of a
corridor in the New Orleans Fairmont Hotel with photocopied posters
noting the resemblance between campaign press secretary Chris
Lehane and TV's Eddie Munster.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments, it's easy to see how this famously robotic
politician got his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech control room of Covad, a firm in California's
Silicon Valley, Gore stood at an ''X'' marked in masking tape on
the floor for a round robin of quickie interviews with five local
TV news crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two-camera shoot?'' he asked a pair from KRON-Channel 4 as he
expertly clipped a microphone to his tie and tucked its wire out of
sight. A former journalist, Gore is a pro talking to cameras and
can turn himself on or off as if flipping a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Between interviews, he zoned out, staring into space and
whistling. A loud ''Ahem'' from Lehane roused Gore from his reverie
and he was back, giving KTVU-Channel 2 an impassioned spiel on
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, in the back seat of his limousine, Gore
rattled off Social Security statistics and talking points against
Republican presidential rival George W. Bush, all the while keeping
an eye on the window for people to wave to.
</P>
<P>
   At his foot was the nylon cooler bag his valet keeps at the
ready with a cold soda, hairbrush, spray (Gore is said to be
obsessed with the growing bald spot at his crown) and small bath
towel.
</P>
<P>
   Prone to profuse sweating, Gore learned on New Hampshire primary
night -- when he nearly went on live television with a shred of
tissue pasted to his damp cheek -- that terry cloth is better for
toweling off.
</P>
<P>
   It could be body heat that explains why Gore changes into
running shorts even for brief flights on a plane kept so chilly
that some people wrap themselves in blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it could be vanity.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, he doggedly maintains his marathon runner's legs and
wears his sweaters tucked in at the waist where they show off the
fruits of traveling with an ''Ab roller,'' a set of weights and a
fitness book, ''The Pilates Body.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore sucks in his stomach when he knows cameras are watching and
his ramrod-straight posture -- a ballerina's envy, except that his
is punctuated by size 10{-wide feet -- never slips.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at his private daily schedule reveals ''attire notes''
for each stop so he will never be over- or underdressed.
</P>
<P>
   As his motorcade headed to the Manchester, N.H., American Legion
hall, the candidate had an aide radio ahead to see if veterans
there were wearing their Legion hats. (Gore, who served five months
in Vietnam as an Army reporter, travels with his.) The message that
came back: Only a few hats. ''We recommend he go sans chapeau.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore devours every word written about him and, even weeks later,
can recite a reporter's exact wording in phrases that delighted or
offended him.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest he is entirely self-absorbed. Despite
a host of aides, Gore lugged his grandson's car seat and diaper bag
off the plane after a recent flight.
</P>
<P>
   Markedly unlike President Clinton, Gore considers it rude to be
more than 12 minutes late for any occasion and longtime aides
report never having heard him raise his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He reprimands with low, icy utterances and often evades
questions he doesn't like by questioning his questioner -- menacing
and well-meaning alike.
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton habit does show up in Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the Milford, N.H., Riverhouse Cafe, Gore ate fingers-to-mouth
from the pile of corned beef hash warming on the grill while he
used the kitchen phone to talk with ESPN radio. He waved off the
appalled chef's insistence upon a plate and fork.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Building Becoming Luxury Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Designed by the architects of the Capitol and
the Washington Monument, the city's first marble building -- 161
years old and boarded up for the last five -- will reopen next year
as a luxury hotel with a subsidy from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Preservation goes beyond simple restoration -- it means
realizing a building's full potential as this new plan will do,''
said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The company doing the job, at an estimated cost of $32 million,
will get a federal tax credit of about $3.2 million to restore the
Tariff Building. The trust noted that businesses can earn such
restoration credits for as much as 20 percent of the cost of a
project.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to get a similar credit for restoring private houses,
with a cap of $20,000 or $50,000, is pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many historic houses are in rundown and decaying
neighborhoods,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., a sponsor of
the legislation. ''The restoration and preservation of such houses
is just as important as other types of historic rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope the new hotel will help restore a neighborhood,
once the center of Washington's downtown, that went downhill but is
showing signs of revival. Nearby structures include the National
Portrait Gallery, National Museum of American Art, the Shakespeare
Theatre and the new MCI Center arena for sports and other events. A
department store and other nearby buildings have been closed for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The building that the hotel will occupy once housed the federal
Tariff Commission. For most of the 1800s it was national
headquarters of the Post Office, and the first U.S. stamps, money
orders and post cards were developed there.
</P>
<P>
   The Tariff Building occupies a square block between E and F
Streets and 7th and 8th Streets in the capital's northwest
quadrant. The federal General Services Administration has started a
$5 million cleanup of the three-story structure, including the
massive Greek columns and two historic plaques.
</P>
<P>
   One plaque tells how on the building site in 1845, Samuel F.B.
Morse opened and operated the first public office in the United
States for sending messages by wire. It adds, in quotation marks,
the biblical text ''What hath God wrought,'' the first message
Morse sent from the Capitol to Baltimore the year before, over the
first American intercity telegraph line.
</P>
<P>
   The other plaque tells of Washington's first theatrical
performance in a building on the site, and how Congress met there
after British troops burned the Capitol in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mills, who designed the Treasury Building and the
Washington Monument, drew up the plans for the first part of the
Tariff Building in 1839. Thomas Walter began extending it in 1855,
and later also added the wings and dome to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The government has leased the building for 60 years to the
Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, which has two hotels in San
Francisco and one in Seattle. The group plans to turn the offices
into a 172-room upscale hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant will open in the old courtyard, reached from the
street by the original cobblestone carriageway.
</P>
<P>
   The national trust has scheduled a ceremony to ''unboard'' the
building Thursday, formally opening the door and linking the
project to its Historic Preservation Week, which starts May 14.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Halt Advance in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebel and U.N. leaders insist
there is no cause for alarm after weekend fighting upset Sierra
Leone's fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
   However, hundreds of U.N. personnel were still being held
hostage by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United Front and U.N.
officials flew together by helicopter Sunday to check out the area
where their forces clashed a day earlier in this West African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   No rebel soldiers could be seen along the route in central
Sierra Leone, and there were no signs of violence, said Brig. Gen.
Mohammed Garba, a U.N. deputy force commander. The group traveled
from just outside the capital, Freetown, to the town of Lunsar, 50
miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to assure the general public that there is no cause for
alarm,'' Garba said Sunday. He called the trip a
''confidence-building mission'' following an erroneous U.N. report
the day before that rebels had advanced to Freetown's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the trip was longtime rebel official Col. Laurence
Wormandia, who said the clash between his forces and U.N. soldiers
happened 60 miles east of Freetown, at the key crossroad town of
Rogberi. The government then sent a helicopter gunship to the
fight, and fired ''a substantial amount of rockets at the RUF,''
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wormandia said the advance began Saturday after media reports
filtered back to rebel fighters that Foday Sankoh, the RUF leader
seen as a semi-deity by many of his followers, had been placed
under house arrest in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to come as far as'' Freetown, Wormandia said
Sunday, adding that Sankoh then radioed his commanders and ordered
them to stop the advance. Sankoh was not officially under house
arrest Sunday, but his home was surrounded by U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Garba, who appealed to Sankoh on Saturday to halt his forces,
said the rebels then ''melted away,'' into the jungle after the
rebel leader's calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, hundreds of U.N. personnel have been taken
hostage by the rebels, and at least one is presumed dead following
the clashes, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   The number went up Saturday, when the U.N. said it had had lost
contact with a 200-man peacekeeper unit. If those peacekeepers --
all Zambian -- have been captured by the rebels, it would bring the
numbers of RUF hostages to nearly 500.
</P>
<P>
   Why they were seized remained unclear Sunday, and the rebels
continued to deny they had taken the U.N. staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook suggested that it was the
peacekeepers' moves toward Sierra Leone's diamond-rich regions --
long controlled by the rebels -- that could be at the root of the
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the cause, nerves remained deeply frayed in Sierra
Leone, where an 8-year civil war ended in July with a peace accord
that brought the rebels -- in principle -- into a power-sharing
government.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials insisted that Freetown remained well-protected,
with 2,100 U.N. troops in the capital -- 500 Jordanians and 1,600
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah expressed disappointment
at the way U.N. soldiers ''capitulated'' to rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we have not yet reached the stage where we believe the
U.N. is incapable of fulfilling of its mandate,'' he said in a
speech broadcast on state radio.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to revive morale among the peacekeepers and follow the
crisis more closely, the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations,
Bernard Miyet, was expected to arrive in Freetown on Tuesday,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people, including aid workers, missionaries and
other civilians, have been evacuated in recent days. On Sunday, the
United States and Britain reduced the number of embassy staff and
advised or helped their citizens to leave.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Working On His Legacy  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he is still working on
his legacy and hasn't figured out exactly what he will do to earn a
living once he leaves the White House next January.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting with reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington
from a weekend back home in Arkansas, Clinton quoted the nation's
sixth chief executive, John Quincy Adams, as saying ''there is
nothing in life more pathetic than a former president.''
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be former president smiled as he said it.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted Adams was elected to the House of Representatives
after his presidency and was engaged in public life until he died
in office at age 81.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear that, like Adams, he intends to maintain an
active, useful life after his own presidency ends next Jan. 20,
even though he hasn't figured out all the details.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his presidential legacy will be, he replied, ''I'm
still working on my legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   While in his native state, Clinton attended the wedding of a
White House staff member, guided his motorcade through a scenic
swatch of the Ozark Mountains, stayed Saturday night at the home of
an ailing friend, and gave a pitch for his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, at a reception that raised $100,000 for her New York
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed re-energized during the chat aboard Air Force
One. He ranged through memories of his life, including an
unsuccessful but absorbing turkey hunt in Arkansas, and reflections
on his study of history.
</P>
<P>
   He said he intends to live with his mother-in-law, Dorothy
Rodham, in Little Rock, Ark., while his $125 million presidential
library is being built.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really like her; we really get along great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, he said, is to fly to New York on weekends to be with
his wife at their home in suburban Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear that building his presidential library on a
site near downtown Little Rock overlooking the Arkansas River will
be his immediate priority.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that while he has thought about it ''a little bit,''
he has made no decisions on exactly what he might do to earn money
once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't want to do or say anything on that subject
now that might conflict with his current presidential duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to make my final decision; I've got to keep my
powder dry,'' Clinton said. ''I have too much fun being president,
so I don't want to contemplate my (future) life right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that, when asked, he does give advice to the first lady
about her New York campaign and to Vice President Al Gore about his
run to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   But said reports that he does so in a systematic, organized,
regular and persistent way are inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they ask me my advice, I give it to them,'' Clinton said.
''But it's way overrated.''

Budget Surplus Projections Look Big
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chalk up another effect of the sizzling economy: The
federal budget is so flush that there should be plenty of money for lawmakers'
election-year spending demands without fear of dipping into Social Security
reserves. Worries about eroding Social Security surpluses limited the spending
President Clinton and Congress approved last year. Now, budget surplus
projections look so big that Republicans could give Clinton every extra penny he
wants -- about $20 billion more than they prefer -- and still not fret about
draining Social Security's trust funds, which both parties have put off-limits
in an election year.

Serious Crime Decline Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With serious crime down 7 percent last year, the nation is
eight years into its longest-running crime decline on record, but experts see
signs that a bottoming-out is coming. Preliminary figures for crimes reported to
police in 1999 extended a trend begun in 1992, the FBI said Sunday. That
eight-year crime decline is now nearly three times longer than the
second-longest decline -- the three years from 1982 through 1984. But a slowing
in 1999 of the crime decline in the nation's largest cities was seen by academic
specialists as a reminder that crime cannot decline forever.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A China Airlines pilot suffered a heart

   Capt. G.I. Gueorguiev, 45, lost consciousness about 40 minutes

<HEADLINE> White Farmer Killed in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A white farmer died Monday after
squatters occupying his farm fractured his skull and broke his
arms. Earlier, a top squatter leader urged his followers to round
up Zimbabweans who still hold British passports and kick them out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dunn was attacked Sunday on a farm near Beatrice, 35 miles
south of Harare, and he died early Monday at a hospital, said David
Hasluck, head of the Commercial Farmers Union. Representatives of
the union planned an emergency meeting later Monday, Hasluck said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack -- along with the abduction and beating of two game
scouts on Saturday -- renewed fears among white Zimbabwean farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people in Zimbabwe, especially in rural areas, at the
moment are unsafe,'' Dunn's neighbor, Guy Watson-Smith, told
reporters at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since black squatters led by veterans of Zimbabwe's independence
war began taking over white-owned farms in February, three white
farmers have been killed and at least a half-dozen severely beaten.
President Robert Mugabe has called the land occupations justified
in this former British colony, where one-third of the fertile land
is still owned by 4,000 whites.
</P>
<P>
   Squatter leader Chenjerai Hunzvi urged people attending a
ruling-party rally in Glen Norah, south of Harare, to seek out
British passport holders and force them to leave the country, Voice
of America reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Hunzvi
called the British ''ruthless, cunning people.'' About 20,000 of
Zimbabwe's 70,000 whites are eligible for passports from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   British passport holders who want to stay should share their
land and toss the passports, said Hunzvi, the leader of the
National Liberation War Veterans Association and a ruling party
parliamentary candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police arrested four low-ranking opposition officials
and impounded a truck after a rally by the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change in Masvingo, 180 miles south of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said the truck was at the
scene of a scuffle Friday in which a ruling party supporter
suffered a cut to the head. He said police were questioning the
driver but that he did not know anything about any other
detentions.
</P>
<P>
   At least 18 people have died in political violence that started
in February, when the MDC led the defeat of a referendum on a
revised constitution. Shortly after the vote, mobs and ruling party
militants began staking claims to land on white-owned farms. More
than 1,000 farms are now occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents accuse Mugabe of provoking the land crisis to
intimidate white farmers and other opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The worst economic crisis since independence has fueled support
for the labor-backed MDC ahead of parliamentary elections, expected
to be called within months. The MDC is seen as the biggest threat
to Mugabe's hold on power since he led the nation to independence
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Commercial Farmers Union reported
that squatters on a game ranch in Masvingo province abducted two
game scouts Saturday and beat them severely before releasing them.
</P>
<P>
   The occupiers also indirectly threatened tourists, saying they
would be killed if they were seen on the occupied land, spokesman
Mike Rook said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Player Vanishes in Minn.  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BAKST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A Cuban college baseball player remained
missing today while his teammates said they were trying hard not to
be distracted by his possible defection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to the States to have a sports exchange and academics
exchange, not to have a migration exchange,'' team captain Osmar
Ernesto Fernandez said Sunday through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Miguel Chaoui was last seen getting into a waiting car
outside the Humphrey Terminal at Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport on Saturday afternoon, shortly after the team arrived to
return a visit by the University of St. Thomas baseball team last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The mood Sunday was sedate among members of ''Equipo Caribe,''
or Team Caribbean in English, which is composed mostly of students
from the University of Havana and some students from a technical
institute in the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
   As he toured the state Capitol on Sunday, Fernandez struggled to
explain why his teammate would leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know why he has made this decision,'' said Fernandez,
26, who has known Chaoui since boyhood. ''In Cuba, we have
everything we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said the team was trying to downplay the distraction
as it prepared for a game against St. Thomas at the Metrodome in
Minneapolis on Tuesday. But he acknowledged anger many players felt
upon hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first reaction was rage. We were a little bit upset,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Cuban team, St. Thomas officials or the Immigration
and Naturalization Service had heard from Chaoui since the car sped
off from the airport, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hennes, a St. Thomas spokesman, said the school has been in
contact with the INS, but the agency has limited authority in such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't do much other than wait for phone calls,'' Hennes
said. ''Legally, the guy is in the United States on a 30 day visa,
so he is not breaking any laws. He is away without leave from the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Dease, the president of St. Thomas, who has
worked hard to build connections between his school and the Cuban
people, told reporters Sunday evening that the INS has asked the
university to remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just hoping that the young man will check in with us or
immigration in the next few days,'' Dease said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Cuban team of college players came to the United
States was in 1987 when a national team played several games at the
Metrodome.

<HEADLINE> Skyway Disaster Lives Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG. Fla. (AP) -- On a monsoon-like morning 20 years
ago, a wind-blown freighter rammed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and a
1,400-foot chunk of concrete roadway crashed into the waters of
Tampa Bay taking seven vehicles and a bus with it.
</P>
<P>
   One man survived the 15-story plunge when his pickup bounced off
the ship's bow. Thirty-five others died.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a $240 million single cable-stayed span, which opened in
1987, arches 175-feet over the bay. But the memory of the May 9,
1980, tragedy is still etched in the minds of those who were there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was phenomenal, unbelievable. The storm had been so
ominous. It had blown through and everything was overcast,''
recalled Joe Blasewitz, a state transportation inspector who had
just crossed the bridge minutes before the accident. ''I thought,
'God is looking over me because I got across the bridge.'
</P>
<P>
   Harbor pilot John Lerro was guiding the ill-fated Summit Venture
through a 40-mile run from the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of Tampa
when the 609-foot ship's radar was knocked out by a sudden,
blinding squall.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility was near zero. The ship, battered by torrential rain
and tossed by up to 90 mph winds, was just seven-tenths of a mile
from the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   To do nothing would have meant certain collision with the bridge
for the empty freighter. Lerro decided to ''shoot for the 800-foot
hole,'' the opening in the channel beneath the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   He missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Summit Venture plowed into a pier, shearing a bridge support
during morning rush hour. A section of concrete roadway plummeted
150 feet into the water along with cars and a bus carrying 26
people.
</P>
<P>
   Trucker Wesley MacIntire's pickup truck was pitched off the
bridge and bounced off the bow of the ship. The crew of the Summit
Venture pulled him to safety. He died of bone cancer nine years
later at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Gattus, now 81, remembers the blinding rain and the
Chicago-to-Miami Greyhound bus that passed the car he and three
co-workers were riding in before it just dropped from sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bus went by us and then, there was nothing, just darkness.
We slid to a stop on the metal part of the bridge and got out,''
Gattus said.
</P>
<P>
   The car stopped just 14 inches from the edge of the southbound
span as it dangled out over the choppy water. Gattus recalls
scrambling to safety, fearing more of the bridge would give way or
that unwitting motorists would run them down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got on my hands and knees and put my fingers in the grate as
I climbed so I wouldn't fall,'' he said. ''We started going up the
ramp of the bridge and I'm hollering to the others: 'The cars ain't
going to see us or hear us. We're going to get run down.'''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the mangled wreckage of the towering
twin span bridge with a gaping hole in the southbound span stood as
a grim reminder of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The northbound span served double-duty for two-way highway
traffic until the new bridge opened in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Gattus had no trouble in the following years driving over the
bridge but that wasn't the case for Jim Crispin, who was in the car
with him the morning of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened stuck with him the rest of his life,'' said
Crispin's widow, Mary. ''He never went over the bridge again. He
couldn't do it. There was too much realism -- a busload of people
drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the 33-year-old crippled structure was demolished.
The ends of the bridge were left intact to form fishing piers.
</P>
<P>
   Lerro, the freighter's pilot, lost his pilot's license a month
after the accident. He eventually won back his license but
voluntarily surrendered it and took on a new career -- at a crisis
hot line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sitting at home saying 'Woe is me,''' Lerro said in a
1990 interview. ''But have I forgiven myself for it? I don't know.
I'm not very forgiving of people, including myself. The people who
died, died forever.''

<HEADLINE> Australia, N.Korea Resume Relations  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN THORNHILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Australia restored diplomatic
relations with North Korea on Monday, joining a handful of Western
nations that have established new ties with the reclusive communist
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced the resumption of
diplomatic representation, effective immediately, nearly 25 years
after ties were severed. Officials from the two countries had been
holding meetings on resuming ties since last September.
</P>
<P>
   The development ''is a positive contribution to improved
relations among countries in the Asia-Pacific region and to
strengthening regional linkages,'' Downer said in a statement. ''I
trust it will also add impetus to the spirit of dialogue and
compromise on the Korean peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   Downer said Australia and North Korea would appoint ambassadors
soon. In the meantime, Australia's ambassador in Beijing would be
in charge of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and North Korea set up diplomatic ties July 31, 1974,
but cut them Nov. 8, 1975, in circumstances that have never been
fully explained.
</P>
<P>
   Australia became the second nation this year to normalize ties
with Pyongyang after Italy established relations in January.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the United States have also been in talks aimed at
normalizing diplomatic ties with North Korea, but no accords have
been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement Monday, Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said he would visit South Korea from May 19-21 for
talks to strengthen economic and political ties with that country.

<HEADLINE> Astros 14, Dodgers 8, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jeff Shaw hit Richard Hidalgo with the bases
loaded to force in the go-ahead run and Roger Cedeno added a three-
run homer in a seven-run 10th inning as the Houston Astros beat the
Los Angeles Dodgers 14-8 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Meluskey led the Astros' 17-hit attack with a career-high
five hits, including a two-run single in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner (1-1) was the winner, retiring all four batters he
faced after entering the game with the bases loaded in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw (2-2) hit Hidalgo after walking Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman, who hit a tying homer off Shaw with two outs in
the ninth Friday night, followed with a bloop RBI single over a
drawn-in infield to give the Astros a 9-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey drove in two more with a single off Alan Mills, and
Cedeno followed with his second homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth, Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek homered
against Jose Lima, helping the Dodgers build a 7-4 lead through
four innings. But the Astros tied it in the seventh on pinch-hitter
Russ Johnson's RBI single against Orel Hershiser, and Bill Spiers'
bases-loaded two-run single off Antonio Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who had a chance to earn his 205th victory and fourth
as a reliever after replacing Eric Gagne in the fourth, allowed
three runs and five hits in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was bumped from the starting rotation after a 10-3
loss to the Astros on April 19, when he tied a modern major league
record by hitting four batters. And he didn't stop there -- plunking
Craig Biggio in the sixth and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio was hit for the second time after Johnson's hit. Osuna,
who had elbow surgery in September and last pitched for the Dodgers
on May 16, 1999, went 3-2 on Spiers before giving up a single to
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took advantage of three Houston errors in a five-run
first against Lima, who lost his previous five decisions. The
All-Star right-hander was charged with seven runs -- four earned --
and six hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, whose ERA jumped from 8.42 to 9.53, committed one of the
Astros' four errors.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti and Hidalgo hit back-to-back homers of Gagne in the
Astros' four-run first. Caminiti hit his seventh homer into the
right-field bullpen and Hidaldo followed with his ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lima, who got to bat before he got to pitch, surrendered
Hollandsworth's third homer on his second delivery of the game.
</P>
<P>
   After a single by Grudzielanek, a wild pitch and Gary
Sheffield's walk, Shawn Green advanced the runners with a slow
roller up the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo called off right fielder Berkman on Karros' fly ball and
dropped it for the Astros' first miscue, allowing Grudzielanek to
score.
</P>
<P>
   After Adrian Beltre's RBI single, first baseman Bagwell grabbed
Chad Kreuter's grounder and tried to start an inning-ending double
play, but his throw to second caromed off Beltre's right leg and
into left field as Karros scored the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Lima then fielded Alex Cora's comebacker and also attempted a
double play, but his throw to second was behind shortstop Bill
Spiers and off his glove, allowing Beltre to score.
</P>
<P>
   Karros led off the third with his eighth homer and Grudzielanek
hit his third home run in the fourth for a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Biggio has been hit 158 times, more than any active player.
... Caminiti has hit 17 home runs at Dodger Stadium. The only
opposing players who have hit 20 or more at Chavez Ravine are
George Foster (23), Hank Aaron (22), Mike Schmidt (22), Dale Murphy
(21), Willie Stargell (21) and Dave Kingman (20). ... Lima has
surrendered 16 homers in 39 2-3 innings. ... Spiers committed the
Astros' fourth error, misplaying Cora's grounder in the third.

<HEADLINE> NBA Playoff Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The fourth quarter started in frantic fashion, with
the lead changing hands on almost every basket.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the New York Knicks went cold.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Miami Heat went ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   With head-butting hustle, suffocating defense and two clutch
baskets by Alonzo Mourning, the Heat edged their bitter rivals
87-83 Sunday in the opener of the second-round playoff series. Game
2 is Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of hype leading to the series, the bitter rivals
started with a thriller. The score changed hands 14 times and was
tied 11 times, including at 79, 81 and 83.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we had it won,'' Knicks center Patrick Ewing said.
''We've got to play a little better down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   New York didn't make a basket in the final 5:34, while Mourning
didn't miss in the final minute. First he got inside position
against Ewing, took a feed from Dan Majerle and scored for an 85-83
lead with 41.8 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Miami regained possession when P.J. Brown tipped Allan Houston's
pass, and Mourning swished a 17-footer with 5.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zo was the go-to man,'' Brown said. ''When he took those
shots, I had no doubt they were going in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final 5:34, the Knicks had 10 possessions and scored just
two points -- on free throws by Latrell Sprewell. They went 0-for-5
with four turnovers down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't make your shots when you don't even have a chance to
take the shots,'' said Houston, who made New York's final basket
and finished with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' final three misses -- by Sprewell, Chris Childs and
Larry Johnson -- came with Miami leading 83-81.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terrible execution,'' Sprewell said. ''When you play a team
like the Heat, you can't disappear down the stretch the way we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat played the kind of defense that helped them win the
Atlantic Division, allowing New York just 15 points in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We locked it down,'' Brown said. ''The screws got bolted, and
we screwed them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Sunday, it was the Los Angeles Lakers 105, Phoenix 77,
and Portland 94, Utah 75.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Philadelphia is at Indiana, which leads the series
1-0.
</P>
<P>
Heat 87, Knicks 83
</P>
<P>
   The officials called only five fouls in the opening period, but
after that the game was more characteristic of the bruising
rivalry. Mourning and Charlie Ward butted heads scrambling for a
loose ball in the third period, but both stayed in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Heisman Trophy winner had some flashbacks for me,''
Mourning said with a chuckle. ''It kind of shook me up a little
bit. I didn't play too much football.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who boasted earlier this week that he's the best center
in the Eastern Conference, came out second-best against close
friend Mourning. The Heat center scored his team's final eight
points and finished with 26 to go with six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who sat out practice Saturday because of back spasms,
showed no effects from the ailment and had 17 points and nine
rebounds in 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway, who missed the Heat's first-round sweep of Detroit
because of a sprained left foot, rejoined the starting lineup and
had six points and seven assists in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically Timmy isn't where he wants to be, but he's still a
vital part of this team,'' Mourning said. ''I want him on the floor
with one leg or one arm, because down the stretch he's going to get
the ball to the right people for us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Jamal Mashburn scored 21 points and helped hold Sprewell
to 11. Brown had eight points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a long way to go, man,'' Mourning said. ''I heard a
lot of people saying, 'Zo, you won the battle today.' This series
is far from being over.''
</P>
<P>
Lakers 105, Phoenix 77
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal had 37 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks in
host Los Angeles' rout.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant added 25 points for the Lakers. Penny Hardaway led
the Suns with 25 points, while Cliff Robinson, who battled foul
problems, added 13 and rookie Shawn Marion had 12.	   Phoenix's Jason Kidd,
playing his second game since breaking his
left ankle March 22, was held to three points, seven rebounds and
seven assists.
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazers 94, Jazz 75
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen scored nine of his 20 points in the final nine
minutes as Portland pulled away at home.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone scored 22 points for Utah despite injuring his left
knee on a freak play in the second quarter. Malone was sitting on
the bench when teammate Armen Gilliam dived for a rebound and
crashed into Malone's chair. Malone came out limping slightly in
the third quarter, but played the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Utah has lost its last 12 playoff games in Portland dating to
the 1991 conference semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 105, Suns 77  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal was his usual unstoppable
self after a sluggish start, dominating the middle and scoring at
will.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, coach Scott Skiles figured the Phoenix Suns had a
much bigger problem Sunday: themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaq is Shaq,'' Skiles said after O'Neal scored 37 points,
grabbed 14 rebounds and blocked four shots to lead the Los Angeles
Lakers to a 105-77 victory over the Suns in the opener of their
Western Conference semifinals. ''Our problem was not Shaquille
O'Neal, our problem was our ineptness handling the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles pointed to the 28 points the Lakers scored after 23
Phoenix turnovers, and the four points scored by his team after
only 12 turnovers by Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the game right there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors, of course:
</P>
<P>
   --O'Neal made a shambles of the Suns' inside game on both ends of
the court, making 14 of- 1 shots after a 1-for-7 start and helping
limit Phoenix to 34 points in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   --Phoenix made only 28 of 77 shots (36.4 percent), and a
miserable 3-of-18 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   --The Lakers made 40 of 92 shots (43.5 percent), 4-of-11 from
3-point range, and outrebounded the Suns 52-42.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were in the game at halftime, trailing 46-41. The
Lakers outscored them in the final 24 minutes 59-36.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ran into the No. 1 team in the NBA, and they showed us why
today,'' said Anfernee Hardaway, who led the Suns with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   After the first quarter, that is. The Lakers followed O'Neal's
lead, shooting just 5-of-23 in the opening period. However, thanks
in part to seven Phoenix turnovers, the game was tied 18-18.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good for us because even though we kind of stunk up the
place offensively, we still managed to stay in the game with our
defense,'' said Kobe Bryant, who scored 25 points and put the
clamps on Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns hung tough in the second period, but the game got away
from them in the third, which ended with the Lakers on top 75-60.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix entered the game rested, having eliminated the defending
NBA champion San Antonio Spurs last Tuesday night. The Lakers,
meanwhile, were extended to five games by Sacramento, winning the
finale 113-86 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors turned out to be of little consequence as the
Lakers made it five wins in as many games against the Suns this
season, and 17-3 in the last 20 games between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our players looked tired in the first half, they got
a little bit of an energy boost in the third quarter,'' Lakers
coach Phil Jackson said. ''In the first quarter, I saw Shaq was
struggling a little bit to get up and down the court, and the pace
elevated a little too quick. We had to bring it back down to our
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 will be Wednesday night at Staples Center before the
best-of-seven series moves to Phoenix for Games 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had an explanation for his poor start: too much rest
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried something new last night,'' he said with a smile.
''I went to bed at 11. I usually go to bed at midnight or later. I
haven't gone to bed at 11 for about eight years. I was sluggish, I
picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the Suns -- Luc Longley, Cliff Robinson, Corie
Blount, Oliver Miller and Rodney Rogers -- tried to guard O'Neal,
with a little help from their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   They had no luck at all after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I get the ball in the blue area, there's not much anybody
can do,'' O'Neal said. ''I'm a pretty skillful big guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a point the Suns wouldn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's your MVP of the league. He got off on us, and he has all
year long,'' Skiles said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a way you can stop him, it's just not legal,'' said
Blount, a former Laker. ''He's hitting jump-hooks, turnaround
shots, I give that credit to him. Once he's doing that, you can't
do much.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd and Rogers, two players the Suns need to produce if they're
to have a chance, had unproductive games.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, playing just his second game since breaking his left ankle
March 22, was held to three points, seven rebounds and seven
assists. Rogers, voted the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year, was only
3-of-13 from the field and scored seven points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers have won 21 of their last 22 games at Staples
Center since beating beaten 95-91 by Portland on Jan. 22. ...
Despite the loss, the Suns have won 11 of their last 16 road games,
including one of two at San Antonio in the playoffs. ... The Suns
and Lakers are meeting for the ninth time in the playoffs, and the
first since 1993, when the heavily favored Suns lost the first two
games in a first-round series before winning the final three to
advance. ... Kidd said he hurt his ankle a little the first time he
shot a layup Sunday, but it was nothing serious and he didn't
expect it to be a factor in Game 2. ''I was just favoring it a
little bit, but I think realizing that I can push off it will help
my confidence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 94, Jazz 75  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Someday Karl Malone and John Stockton will
remember a time when they were young men, and when they could beat
the Portland Trail Blazers on their home court.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are fading further into the distance, and each loss
here threatens to push the Utah Jazz greats closer to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our guys didn't come to play,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said
after Sunday's 94-75 Game 1 loss to the Blazers, Utah's 12th
straight playoff defeat in Portland. ''I'll tell you right now, we
didn't come to play, and this series will be over real quick if
they're going to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen scored nine of his 20 points over the final nine
minutes as the Blazers held Utah to just one basket in the first
5:46.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we consider the backbone of our team: playing
defense and shutting teams' offense down,'' Pippen said. ''It took
us three quarters before we could really get a good feel for this
team, but in the fourth quarter, our defense took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anthony added 12 points in the final period, and Damon
Stoudamire finished with 14 points. Arvydas Sabonis had 14 rebounds
and Brian Grant added 10.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's last playoff win here was on April 30, 1988, in Game 2 of
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   While Portland had four days off after its first-round series,
the Jazz were playing on less than two days rest after struggling
past Seattle in Game 5 on Friday night, and their fatigue showed.
</P>
<P>
   Utah missed nine of its first 10 shots in the fourth quarter and
shot 33 percent for the period, slightly worse than the 37 percent
it shot for the game. But Sloan wouldn't have any excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had 24 hours to sleep. That's their own fault if they
can't get the rest and get ready to play. We had too many days off
last week. Now we get a little rest. Who cares? I don't care,
because they get paid to play, and they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers know not to overestimate the value of winning the
opening game; they lost Game 1 to the Jazz in last year's
conference semifinals, then regrouped to win in a grueling six
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a seven-game series, not a one-game series,'' Malone
said. ''We need to make some adjustments and come back and win. We
need more intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone led the Jazz with 22 points despite straining a ligament
in his left knee on a freak play late in the second quarter. Malone
was sitting on the bench when teammate Armen Gilliam dived for a
rebound and crashed into Malone's chair. Malone came out limping
slightly in the third quarter, but played the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who averaged 6.8 points in four regular-season games
against the Jazz, could once again hobble Malone's title chances.
Pippen and Michael Jordan helped the Chicago Bulls beat the Jazz in
the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether these kinds of games were the reason Pippen
was acquired by the Blazers from Houston, Malone snapped: ''I don't
want to hear that,'' followed by an expletive. ''I don't care about
that. End of interview. I'm done here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led 65-61 to start the fourth quarter, but Pippen's
aggressiveness helped put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   His short turnaround jumper extended the lead to 71-63 with 8:36
remaining. Pippen hit a 3-pointer to make it 80-67, and Anthony
sealed it with two free throws, a layup and 3-pointer for an 87-71
lead with 3:48 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greg and the guys that came in the fourth quarter, their
defensive energy was terrific, so we stayed with them and rode them
out,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led 44-34 at halftime and pushed the lead to 13
early in the third, but the Jazz chipped away.
</P>
<P>
   After Malone cleared out with his left arm and hit a layup,
Rasheed Wallace started screaming at the officials and had to be
restrained by teammates. Dunleavy quickly subbed Grant for him, but
before Wallace could leave the court, he said something else and
was hit with a technical.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton made the technical free throw and Malone hit his free
throw to cut the lead to 63-58 with 1:29 left. Utah trimmed it to
four by the end of the quarter, but missed four straight free
throws over the last 35 seconds -- two by Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effort was there, but we just didn't get it done,''
Stockton said. ''We were down by only four entering the fourth, but
we really gave them an opportunity at the end of the third.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thirty seconds of silence were observed before the game in
honor of Blazers assistant coach Bill Musselman, who died Friday, a
month after being diagnosed with bone marrow cancer. ... Malone
slipped to second in playoff scoring average at 29.2. The Los
Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal is at 30.4. ... The Blazers had a
tremendous advantage at the line, hitting 26 of 27 free throws
after making just eight of their first 14. Utah got to the line
just 23 times, hitting 16. ... Portland is 7-0 in seven-game series
when winning the first game.

<HEADLINE> Actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Dies  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- He earned a chestful of medals, wrote stories,
acted in some 75 movies, produced television shows, and served as
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's special envoy.
</P>
<P>
   The rakishly handsome Douglas Fairbanks Jr., the son of the
swashbuckling superstar of silent films, didn't just glide on his
father's coattails: He made his own mark.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks, the star of such films as ''Catherine the Great,''
''The Prisoner of Zenda'' and ''Gunga Din,'' died Sunday, said his
widow, Vera Shelton Fairbanks. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never tried to emulate my father. Anyone trying to do that
would be a second-rate carbon copy,'' he once said. ''I was
determined to be my own man, although having the Fairbanks name did
make it easier to get into an office to see someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Film director Michael Winner, who once met Fairbanks while
working for a local newspaper, remembered the actor as ''a
wonderful representative of a bygone era.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a gentleman adventurer,'' Winner said. ''His was a
cinema where people played by the rules, where the hero was always
well-dressed, well-spoken and impeccably mannered. He typified that
type of leading man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was born in New York City on Dec. 9, 1909 -- the only
son of Douglas Fairbanks and his first wife, Anna. His parents
divorced when he was 9 and he lived with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   His movie career began at age 13 with an appearance in ''Stephen
Steps Out.'' In 1925 he made several more films, and the
influential movie magazine ''Photoplay'' said that at his studio,
''he is considered a real bet, with much of his father's charm and
artistry.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his stage debut in Los Angeles in 1927, winning good
reviews. He began getting better movie roles, appearing with Greta
Garbo in ''A Woman of Affairs'' and in a Frank Capra film, ''The
Power of the Press,'' both 1928.
</P>
<P>
   His career picked up with the coming of sound. In the early
1930s he had a string of film successes, including a showy role in
''Little Caesar,'' and was able to write his own ticket. ''I
demanded and received approval of cast, story and director. I don't
know how I got away with it, but I did!'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At age 19 he married Joan Crawford, then the quintessential
flapper in films such as ''Our Dancing Daughters.'' They divorced
four years later in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   But he said they remained friendly up to her death in 1977.
''The Joan Crawford that I've heard about in 'Mommie Dearest' is
not the Joan Crawford I knew back when,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, he married Mary Lee Epling Hartford, former wife of A&AMP;P
supermarket heir Huntington Hartford. They had three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   A lieutenant, j.g., in the U.S. Navy Reserve, he was called to
active service later that year and served until 1946. He earned an
American Silver Star, the British Distinguished Service Cross and
the French Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first American officer to command a British
flotilla of raiding craft during a commando operation in World War
II. He served under Adm. Lord Louis Mountbatten, who later
introduced him to his nephew, Prince Philip, the husband of Queen
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks became a favorite of the royal couple, entertaining
them at his home, much to the chagrin of Mayfair society. The first
time they came he had a couple of singers to entertain them --
Maurice Chevalier and Cab Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 President Roosevelt appointed him a special envoy to
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and Panama. After the war,
Fairbanks was chairman of the fund-raising committee for CARE,
which sent more than $150 million worth of food parcels and other
goods to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He resumed his film career with ''Sinbad the Sailor'' -- one of
the biggest hits of 1946. His last movie was ''Ghost Story'' in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Besides acting, he was involved in a variety of business
enterprises -- from ball point pens to land development, theatrical
copyrights to film production.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he produced 160 episodes of a television anthology
series called ''Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents.'' He starred in
approximately a quarter of the 30-minute programs, which were
filmed in England.
</P>
<P>
   In his 50s and 60s he appeared in revivals of ''My Fair Lady''
and ''The Pleasure of His Company'' as well as a variety of TV
specials and guest appearances on shows ranging from ''Laugh-In''
to ''Love Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   He once said of all his accomplishments he was proudest of the
articles and stories he published over the years. He published the
first volume of his autobiography, ''The Salad Days,'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   His second wife died of cancer in 1988. In May 30, 1991,
Fairbanks married merchandiser Vera Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Fairbanks is survived by three
daughters, eight grandchildren and six great grandchildren. Mrs.
Fairbanks said her husband will be buried alongside his father at
the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, although funeral arrangements were
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've led an enormously lucky life,'' Fairbanks reflected in
1989. ''I've done what I wanted to do. I worked hard and played
hard, and it was all tremendously rewarding. I just wish it could
go on and on and on.''

White Farmer Killed in Zimbabwe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A white farmer died Monday after squatters
occupying his farm fractured his skull and broke his arms. Earlier, a top
squatter leader urged his followers to round up Zimbabweans who still hold
British passports and kick them out of the country. Alan Dunn was attacked
Sunday on a farm near Beatrice, 35 miles south of Harare, and he died early
Monday at a hospital, said the head of the Commercial Farmers Union. The attack
-- along with the abduction and beating of two game scouts on Saturday --
renewed fears among white Zimbabwean farmers.

Fire Shuts Down Los Alamos Lab
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WHITE ROCK, N.M. (AP) -- A fire intended to improve the watershed in
Bandelier National Monument was burning out of control late Sunday near Los
Alamos, shutting down the Los Alamos National Laboratory. No injuries had been
reported from that fire or another blaze in south-central New Mexico. A lab
spokesman said the blaze had spread to Water Canyon on the lab's western
boundary near a work site. The site is where much of the lab's work with high
explosives is conducted, but officials said all explosives had been put in
fire-resistant bunkers.

Budget Surplus Projections Look Big
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chalk up another effect of the sizzling economy: The
federal budget is so flush that there should be plenty of money for lawmakers'
election-year spending demands without fear of dipping into Social Security
reserves. Worries about eroding Social Security surpluses limited the spending
President Clinton and Congress approved last year. Now, budget surplus
projections look so big that Republicans could give Clinton every extra penny he
wants -- about $20 billion more than they prefer -- and still not fret about
draining Social Security's trust funds, which both parties have put off-limits
in an election year.

Clinton Still Working On His Legacy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he is still working on his legacy
and hasn't figured out exactly what he will do to earn a living once he leaves
the White House next January. Chatting with reporters Sunday as he flew back to
Washington from a weekend back home in Arkansas, Clinton quoted the nation's
sixth chief executive, John Quincy Adams, as saying "there is nothing in life
more pathetic than a former president." The soon-to-be former president smiled
as he said it. And he noted Adams was elected to the House of Representatives
after his presidency and was engaged in public life until he died in office at
age 81.

Rebels Halt Advance in Sierra Leone
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebel and U.N. leaders insist there is no
cause for alarm after weekend fighting upset Sierra Leone's fragile peace
process. However, hundreds of U.N. personnel were still being held hostage by
rebel forces. Leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United Front and U.N. officials
flew together by helicopter Sunday to check out the area where their forces
clashed a day earlier in this West African nation. No rebel soldiers could be
seen along the route in central Sierra Leone, and there were no signs of
violence, said Brig. Gen. Mohammed Garba, a U.N. deputy force commander.

Serious Crime Decline Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With serious crime down 7 percent last year, the nation
is eight years into its longest-running crime decline on record, but experts see
signs that a bottoming-out is coming. Preliminary figures for crimes reported to
police in 1999 extended a trend begun in 1992, the FBI said Sunday. That
eight-year crime decline is now nearly three times longer than the
second-longest decline -- the three years from 1982 through 1984. But a slowing
in 1999 of the crime decline in the nation's largest cities was seen by academic
specialists as a reminder that crime cannot decline forever.

Montreal Expos on Sunday. The Brewers, who entered the game with a majors-worst

Hermanson for the biggest offensive outburst of their 10-game homestand, which
they finished 3-7.

<HEADLINE> Serious Crime Decline Continues  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With serious crime down 7 percent last year,
the nation is eight years into its longest-running crime decline on
record, but experts see signs that a bottoming-out is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary figures for crimes reported to police in 1999
extended a trend begun in 1992, the FBI said Sunday. That
eight-year crime decline is now nearly three times longer than the
second-longest decline -- the three years from 1982 through 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But a slowing in 1999 of the crime decline in the nation's
largest cities was seen by Professor Alfred Blumstein of
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and other academic
specialists as a reminder that crime cannot decline forever. ''They
(major cities) are the leaders both on the way up and on the way
down,'' Blumstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report said all seven major types of crime were down not
only nationwide but also in each region of the nation, and in
suburbs, rural areas and in cities of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault were down a combined 7 percent, led by murder and robbery,
both down 8 percent. Rape and assault were down 7 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   The property crimes of burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft
also were down a combined 7 percent, led by an 11 percent decline
in burglary. Auto theft was down 8 percent, larceny-theft 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blumstein said the record eight-year decline ''may be finally
undoing the great rise in crime of the late 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's longest and steepest crime rise -- increases of 10.2
to 13.8 percent from 1965 through 1969 -- came as baby boomers
reached the crime-prone ages of 15 to 25 and ''civil rights and
Vietnam War protests increased distrust of government,'' Blumstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that crime trends may soon flatten out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, murder, the most fully reported crime, was down 2
percent in cities over 500,000 population, but fell by between 7
percent and 14 percent in smaller cities, 12 percent in suburbs and
17 percent in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Blumstein, Professor James Alan Fox of Northeastern
University in Boston noted smaller crime declines in the largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will be the first to reach the bottom,'' Fox said,
pointing out that murders in New York actually rose a bit in 1999,
from 633 to 671.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge is to be sure the numbers don't go back up to
any great degree,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's record prison population provides only ''temporary
relief,'' he added, ''because those people will come out of prison
and many will still have inadequate skills and bad attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said, ''Now is not the time to
become complacent. ... Let's try harder. We must redouble our
efforts by providing alternatives to crime as well as tough
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans pointed proudly to anti-crime measures
they had championed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the report ''confirms that our anti-crime
strategy -- more police officers on the beat, fewer illegal guns and
violent criminals on the street -- is having a powerful impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the House crime
subcommittee, gave credit to strategies developed by local
governments in community policing for which Clinton won federal
funding. But he highlighted a GOP-sponsored law he said has induced
27 states to impose longer prison terms to get more federal money
to build prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
the results ''were largely due to the leadership at the state,
local and federal level of Republicans committed to arresting,
prosecuting and incarcerating violent criminals.'' GOP-backed
legislation has provided $700 million a year for prison
construction, Hatch noted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said further progress could come from passing his
remaining gun-control measures, like child-safety locks and
background checks on gun buyers at gun shows. Hatch, reflecting GOP
opposition that has blocked those measures, noted the crime
reductions came without enacting Clinton's remaining gun proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Academic experts credited both parties' favorite anti-crime
nostrums but also a wider range of factors, including some beyond
the control of politicians, such as the aging of the baby boomers
past crime-prone years.
</P>
<P>
   To that list, Fox added ''evaporating crack cocaine markets and
the violent crack gangs that drove the numbers up in the 1980s,
smarter policing, increased interest in prevention down to the
grass roots, and a better economy giving cities more to invest in
crime control'' and providing jobs for some who might otherwise
turn to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI figures come from more than 17,000 U.S. police agencies
and extend back to 1960.

	   PARISH, N.Y. (AP) -- A 27-year-old man was sitting in the middle
of a county road when he was struck and killed by a car, state
police said today.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Hirsch of Parish was struck about 2:30 a.m. Sunday on
county Route 26 by a car driven by Frank J. Sobotka, 37, also of
Parish, troopers said.

   Sobotka spotted Hirsch when he crested a hill near an
intersection about 35 miles north of Syracuse, but could not avoid
him in time, said state police Sgt. Dale Crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Sobotka was charged with driving while intoxicated and released
on his own recognizance. Hirsch, too, had been drinking before the
accident, according to friends who said he apparently was trying to

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 65; Dow Down 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower at the start of trading
today as investors worried about rising interest rates and took
some profits from Friday's market rally.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 5.22 at 10,572.64.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 65.02 at 3,751.80 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 8.51 to 1,424.12.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said many investors were selling stocks to capture
short-term gains from a solid rally on Friday, when the Dow rose
165 points and the Nasdaq rose 96 points. With interest rate
worries settling over Wall Street, many investors appeared
reluctant to take significant new positions. Trading was extremely
light.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its next meeting on May 16. The
Fed has raised interest rates five times since last June in a
series of modest, quarter-percentage point hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money. This time around, however, many analysts believe a heftier
increase could mollify investors because it might signify that the
Fed is nearing the end of its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which led Friday's rally, were mostly lower
today. Hewlett-Packard fell 3[ to 133| and Intel fell 3 to 120].
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems fell 3 3/16 to 87 5/16 and PMC-Sierra fell 5}
to 174\.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 102.08 million
shares, behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.83 to 509.01.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.3 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.5 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.7 percent.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The musical comedy classics ''Kiss Me, Kate''
and ''The Music Man'' drew the most Tony nominations today for the
best of the Broadway season. Notably missing from the best musical
category was Disney's lavish version of ''Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' the Cole Porter musical loosely adapted from
Shakespeare's ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' received 12 nominations,
while Meredith Willson's corn-fed remembrance of 1912 Iowa took
eight. They will compete for best musical revival along with
''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and the revue ''Tango Argentino.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's drama about the controversial
meeting of two physicists on opposite sides during World War II,
was nominated for best play.
</P>
<P>
   It will compete for the top prize against ''Dirty Blonde,''
Clauda Shear's warm-hearted biography of sex symbol Mae West; ''The
Ride Down Mt. Morgan,'' Arthur Miller's examination of an
unrepentant bigamist; and ''True West,'' Sam Shepard's savage
comedy about two battling brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' three stories told through dance, was nominated for
best new musical, along with ''James Joyce's The Dead,'' ''Swing!''
and ''The Wild Party.'' In addition to ''Aida,'' the critically
panned ''Saturday Night Fever'' also was passed over in the
category. But ''Aida'' composer Elton John was nominated for best
score, along with lyricist Tim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Also snubbed was Patrick Stewart, star of Arthur Miller's ''The
Ride Down Mt. Morgan.'' Stewart had sparred publicly with the
show's producers over what he perceived as lack of support for the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for best actor in a play, nominators picked the two
stars of ''True West,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly;
Gabriel Byrne, who portrays a dissolute actor in ''A Moon for the
Misbegotten''; Stephan Dillane, the adulterous writer in ''The Real
Thing''; and David Suchet, who plays Mozart's rival in ''Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   A mother-daughter race was set up in the actress category with
Rosemary Harris, who stars in Noel Coward's ''Waiting in the
Wings,'' going against her daughter, Jennifer Ehle, who is in ''The
Real Thing.'' Also nominated were Claudia Shear, who portrays Mae
West in ''Dirty Blonde''; Cherry Jones, from ''A Moon for the
Misbegotten''; and Jayne Atkinson of ''The Rainmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Craig Bierko, the charming con man Professor Harold
Hill in ''The Music Man,'' was nominated for best actor in a
musical. His competition: George Hearn, who appeared in the Stephen
Sondheim revue ''Putting It Together''; Christopher Walken of ''The
Dead''; Mandy Patinkin, who plays a jealous vaudeville performer in
''The Wild Party''; and Brian Stokes Mitchell, who stars in the
revival of ''Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin Mazzie, Mitchell's co-star in ''Kate,'' was nominated for
best actress in a musical, along with Toni Collette of ''The Wild
Party''; Heather Headley, the title character in ''Aida''; Rebecca
Luker, Marian the librarian in ''The Music Man''; and Audra
McDonald, who appeared in ''Marie Christine,'' a retelling of the
Medea legend set in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will be announced June 4 during nationally televised
ceremonies on CBS from Radio City Music Hall with Rosie O'Donnell
as host. O'Donnell had dropped out of last year's telecast, saying
she had too many other commitments.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Moves To Keep Law License  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to keep his law license,
President Clinton has argued that his testimony in the Monica
Lewinsky case was ''not false as he defines that term,'' according
to court papers filed by the conservative group that is seeking
revocation of his license.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer has declined to make public the president's
legal brief to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which must decide
whether Clinton can keep his state license allowing him to practice
law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southeastern Legal Foundation made public today its
rebuttal to the president's argument, and characterized his 80-page
filing submitted in secret several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavine, an official with the Atlanta-based foundation,
said Clinton's filing argues against revocation and contains
language that ''suggests that a sanction no harsher and perhaps
more lenient than a letter of reprimand would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, however, argues the president's admissions during his
impeachment provided enough evidence that he misled courts in the
Lewinsky matter to warrant revocation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is no ordinary Arkansas lawyer. Rather, he is
the president of the United States of America and, as such, is held
to the model rules requiring the higher ethical standard for
attorneys who hold public office, even those who may become
litigants or defendants,'' the group's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's personal attorney, was not
immediately available for comment today, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber
Wright fined the president for contempt for false testimony about
Lewinsky in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1999 ruling, Wright cited 10 alleged lies by the
president that ''no reasonable person would seriously dispute.''
The Southeastern Legal Foundation seized on her 1999 conclusions,
as well as Clinton's own admission he misled people during the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, the president frankly admits the conduct at issue.
Second, the allegations are findings of fact by a federal judge in
a fully and fairly contested litigation as well as by the Congress
in impeachment proceedings,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The group described Clinton's Arkansas Supreme Court filing this
way: ''President Clinton spends the bulk of his 80-page brief
attempting to show that his testimony was not 'false' as he defines
that term.''
</P>
<P>
   The group countered that the American Bar Association rules for
professional conduct ''proscribe misleading conduct'' as the
standard and do not even use the words ''false testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is true as the president asserts in his response,
that 'charges of false testimony under oath with possibly penal
consequences are a serious matter,' the matter before this
committee does not deal with perjury by litigants as that term is
used in criminal law but rather misconduct within the applicable
standards for lawyers,'' the group argued.
</P>
<P>
   To further its case, the group cited the president's legal
filings from the impeachment trial as evidence he has already
admitted to being misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the president did was wrong. ... The simple moral truth
(is) that his behavior in this matter was wrong. ... He misled his
wife, his friends, and our nation about the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the filing said, quoting one of
the president's impeachment filings.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation in Atlanta filed the first
complaint seeking revocation of Clinton's Arkansas law license on
Sept. 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A second complaint arose automatically under state law when
Wright found Clinton in contempt of court on April 12, 1999, for
lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Both complaints focus on Clinton's statements about Lewinsky in
the Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Wright cited Clinton for civil contempt rather than criminal
contempt, thus preserving the authority of the Office of
Independent Counsel, now headed by Ken Starr's successor, Robert
Ray, to pursue criminal charges against Clinton later if Ray
chooses.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 48; Nasdaq Down 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors worried
about rising interest rates and took some profits from Friday's
market rally. Blue-chip stocks shook off early weakness and turned
higher on the surprising strength of financial shares.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 48.27 at 10,626.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 75.82 at 3,741.00 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 4.33 at 1,428.30.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said many investors were selling stocks to capture
short-term gains from a solid rally on Friday, when the Dow rose
165 points and the Nasdaq rose 96 points. With interest rate
worries settling over Wall Street, many investors appeared
reluctant to take significant new positions. Trading was extremely
light.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its next meeting on May 16. The
Fed has raised interest rates five times since last June in a
series of modest, quarter-percentage point hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money. This time around, however, many analysts believe a heftier
increase could mollify investors because it might signify that the
Fed is nearing the end of its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which led Friday's rally, were mostly lower
today. Hewlett-Packard fell 3[ to 133| and Intel fell 3 to 120].
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems fell 3 3/16 to 87 5/16 and PMC-Sierra fell 5}
to 174\.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many analysts expect those technology stocks -- among
the most established and best-capitalized -- to regain leadership of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within this environment of lingering interest rate concerns,
we believe stock selection ought to focus on those companies with
strong earnings momentum,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc. For the most part, Shaughnessy
said, that means technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors remain leery of the volatile technology sector.
Cisco fell 3] to 64] after an article in Barron's said the
company's rapid growth rate could slow if Cisco stops acquiring
companies at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks shook off interest-rate worries and helped the
Dow turn higher. American Express was up 3~ to 150.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 250.01 million
shares, behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.98 to 507.86.

<HEADLINE> Group Urges Japanese Deregulation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The head of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on Monday urged Japan to accelerate
deregulation in sectors such as telecommunications to boost
economic growth, a report said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Johnston, secretary general of the Paris-based group of
the world's wealthiest countries, told reporters in Tokyo that the
sluggish pace of regulatory reform hampered Japan's economy in the
1990s, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's feeble economy over the past decade may be ''the result
of a failure to have effective regulatory reform in many areas,
including the telecommunications sector,'' he said, according to
Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan are currently in a heated dispute
over Japan's phone connection rates, which Washington says are too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was optimistic about the overall state of the Japanese
economy, saying that the economy bottomed out last year and was
moving toward a growth cycle, Kyodo reported.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Presidents Back China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a united stand, three former presidents
today joined President Clinton in giving Congress a strong push to
grant China permanent trade benefits. ''In economic terms, the case
is clear,'' they said in an open letter.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrated by the White House, the two-page letter gives the
Clinton administration more clout to persuade Congress to extend
permanent trade status to China and ease the Asian nation's
long-sought entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agreement to bring China into the WTO is the product of
more than 13 years of tough negotiations conducted by four
administrations, Democratic and Republican,'' Presidents Ford,
Carter and Bush wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It builds upon a series of market-opening initiatives pursued
by every president since the second world war. It will open China's
markets to us without increasing China's access to our market,''
they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Ford and Carter plan to be at the White House on
Tuesday with former secretaries of state and national security
advisers to rally support for the legislation. If the House
approves the measure in a vote expected later this month, Senate
passage is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and the two top House Democratic leaders are
fighting the legislation, suggesting it will hurt U.S. jobs. The
Clinton administration, Republican leaders and U.S. business groups
have been lobbying lawmakers for weeks to get the legislation
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made significant progress, but there's still much work
to be done,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ''The
endorsement of three former presidents should have a significant
impact on members who are trying to make up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The former presidents said failure to grant China permanent
normal trade relations status would ''squander'' the best
opportunity the United States has had in a generation to address
long-standing concerns about China's trading practices.
</P>
<P>
   They also said it would improve U.S.-China relations, make
positive change within China more likely by opening doors to the
information revolution and speeding up reforms that are dismantling
many state controls over the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vote against PNTR will make it far more difficult to attain
these critical goals,'' the presidents wrote. ''It would encourage
deeper tensions between Beijing and Taiwan and diminish our ability
to work for Asian stability.''

<HEADLINE> Bob Hope in Washington for Opening  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legendary entertainer Bob Hope is in
Washington to attend the opening of the permanent Bob Hope Gallery
of American Entertainment in the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's anxious to be here,'' Hope publicist Ward Grant said
today. ''We're anxious to get him here and get some photographs at
the exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope and wife, Delores, arrived Saturday, Grant said. Hope is
scheduled to attend a private reception Tuesday evening at the
library.
</P>
<P>
   Hope's son Anthony, daughter Linda, and singer Connie Stevens
spoke at a press preview of the exhibit today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to going through this collection myself
and reliving and resharing those times and I hope the public feels
the same way,'' Anthony Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Stevens, ''He taught me more than anything to make the
stage my home and the audience my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes 88,000 pages of jokes given to the library
by Hope as well as countless other letters, photos, videos and
other momentos.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hail to the Chief of The West Wing  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Martin Sheen got the hang of being president
pretty quick.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was shooting the final scene for the pilot
episode of ''The West Wing,'' NBC's White House drama in which he
stars as President Josiah Bartlet. The president is in the Oval
Office on a grueling day that seems to be nearing its end. But then
he calls out to his always-within-earshot secretary, ''Mrs.
Landingham! What's next?''
</P>
<P>
   ''The first take I said it with a kind of dread,'' Sheen
recalls. ''Like, 'Omigod, I can't imagine what's going to fall out
of her face now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, who created the series and wrote the script,
dashed up to Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'No, no, no! Bartlet LOVES being president! He LOVES
the pain! He hates to go to bed, he can't wait to get up in the
morning! You've got to ENJOY every part of this job!'
</P>
<P>
   ''And I thought, 'Omigod, yes!' And that was it. That was when I
found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the presidency has been in very good hands, at least
where ''The West Wing'' is concerned. With Sheen presiding over a
splendid ensemble that includes Richard Schiff, Rob Lowe, John
Spencer and Allison Janney, the Bartlet administration resonates
with heart, drive and brainy banter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about a group of people who serve a president and believe
in his agenda,'' says Sheen during a recent visit to Manhattan.
''But it's not a bully pulpit. The opposition voice is always,
always heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we don't always win. Most of the time,'' he says with a
knowing smile, ''we get our butts kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bartlet White House, setbacks and missteps are a way of
life. Even supporters of this liberal Democrat (a New
Hampshire-bred hybrid of Bill Clinton and John Kennedy, Jimmy
Carter and Harry Truman) are on his case, complaining that his
''Practical Idealism'' agenda isn't liberal and Democratic enough.
His approval rating, low since he squeaked into office, has now
sunk to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ''The West Wing'' (which airs Wednesday at 9
p.m. Eastern) is a solid Nielsen winner, a critical favorite and,
in just its first season, it captured a prestigious Peabody Award.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, its star LOVES his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's having more fun than a kid with a refrigerator carton,''
says Aaron Sorkin, speaking from the series' Los Angeles home base.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin needs only to point to the night Sheen delivered a
rousing speech to a banquet room filled with gussied-up extras --
for 11 heady takes. ''He kept saying, 'Let's do it one more
time.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am the acting president,'' Sheen declares, his
ain't-it-grand grin fully deployed. ''I'm having the time of my
life, if the truth be known.''
</P>
<P>
   It could give a guy notions. In an era when actors and politicos
thrive as members of a single super-race, Sheen could be forgiven
if he pondered being president for real. Arrested dozens of times
during political protests, he clearly has feelings about social
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a pacifist!'' he scoffs. ''There's no chance in hell that
I would ever be in the White House. The Republic is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Besides, I'm not interested in politics per se. I'm very
interested in social justice. I don't really believe that many
politicians are changing the world. Civil rights, labor unions, the
peace movement: private citizens taking personal responsibility and
going public. That's when things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's a bit ironic (is it not?) that Sheen is playing the
world's preeminent pol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah,'' Sheen agrees. ''But 'play' is the key word.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he admits to chafing when Bartlet makes a choice he
disagrees with. For instance, in one powerful episode, the
president came face-to-face with the death penalty and refused to
commute an execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had the chance to save a guy's life,'' says Sheen almost
accusingly. ''He knew it was sinful -- to kill anyone is sinful --
and out of political expedience, he chose not to save him.''
</P>
<P>
   But not without remorse. In the final scene, Bartlet receives
his boyhood priest in the Oval Office, who gives him a stern
talking to, then hears his confession.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our president on 'The West Wing' is not Catholic by
accident,'' says Sheen. ''We added that (element) so that he would
have a moral frame of reference, and take personal responsibility
for sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his failings, then, Bartlet is a righteous man. For a
show that prides itself on authenticity, this might strike some
viewers as a fanciful break with Bartlet's real-life counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House has been a source of inspiration for
Sorkin and ''The West Wing,'' which even hired former press
secretary Dee Dee Myers as one of its consultants. Sheen calls the
president ''a hero of mine'' and freely admits to modeling some
facets of his performance on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bartlet keeps his mitts off the interns. And he, unlike

<HEADLINE> Mourners fill cathedral to remember Cardinal O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor's life was celebrated at
a funeral Mass today marked by pageantry, prayer, hope and an
outpouring of love for the man who served the archdiocese's 2.4
million Catholics for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   A massive funeral procession of 800, including priests, 120
bishops and 15 cardinals wound its way through the great bronze
doors of St. Patrick's Cathedral where an estimated 3,500 invited
mourners gathered, including President Bill Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy remembered O'Connor as a priest who
reached out to all. After her husband was killed in a Long Island
Rail Road shooting, McCarthy said she received a letter from the
cardinal, telling her the tragedy would take her on a different
path. She went on to run for Congress and lobby for more stringent
gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what made him a great man,'' she said as she entered
the cathedral. ''He always reached out to ordinary people. It
didn't matter what religion you were. He was truly a shepherd to
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the cathedral, hundreds of people stood
eight to 10 deep, weathering 91-degree heat, some under umbrellas,
to listen to the service over loudspeakers. A Red Cross truck was
stationed nearby passing out water.
</P>
<P>
   Other dignitaries who attended included Vice President Al Gore,
former President George Bush, Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and
ex-Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's closed coffin, covered in a white linen cloth, sat in
the center aisle in front of the majestic church. On top, lay the
cardinal's personal crucifix and a book of the Gospel
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Angelo Sodano, sent by Pope John Paul II to represent
the Vatican, carried O'Connor's staff in the procession. Sodano,
the Vatican's secretary of state, presided at the ceremony, which
according to Catholic guidelines focuses on celebrating O'Connor's
new life in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday of brain cancer. After the service,
an honor guard will carry O'Connor's casket down a narrow staircase
to a crypt beneath St. Patrick's altar, where all previous
archbishops of New York are buried.
</P>
<P>
   His coffin will be placed near that of Pierre Toussaint, a
19th-century Haitian whose cause for sainthood was supported by
O'Connor. That portion of the ceremony will be private, with only
O'Connor's relatives and a small group of church officials present.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor helped plan the funeral, handpicking many of the songs
and prayers. The music included ''Ava Maria,'' sung by Irish tenor
Frank Patterson and ''Lift High the Cross,'' the hymn sung when
O'Connor was installed as head of the New York Archdiocese, which
stretches 4,700 square miles and includes three counties in New
York City and seven north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, hundreds of people filed into St. Patrick's
Cathedral to pay tribute to O'Connor, hours before his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   More mourners had gathered on the steps outside for other
scheduled Masses and a public viewing, which were canceled at 8
a.m. to give church officials and the Secret Service time to secure
the area, archdioceses spokesman Joe Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House this morning, President Clinton praised
O'Connor for his work as a chaplain in the armed services and then
as the leader of the New York archdiocese, the nation's third
largest Catholic diocese. Los Angeles is the largest and Chicago is
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he set a very large role in the life of the church,
and even when he was controversial and when he disagreed with me, I
liked the fact that he was outspoken and he stood up for what he
believed in,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking after the annual Associated Press meeting here,
called O'Connor a friend and said he was supportive during his
wife, Tipper's, campaign to include parental advisories on albums.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, tens of thousands of mourners attended
Masses and the public viewing to say good-bye to O'Connor, who once
said he hoped his epitaph would simply read: ''He was a good
priest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was important for me to be here. I wanted to pray for him
and let him know that he was very kind, good to the poor people,
the Spanish people,'' Yolanda O. Velez said this morning after
walking through the cathedral and past the cardinal's body, lying
in a velvet-lined coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many bishops attending the service was Bishop Edward
Michael Egan, 68, of Bridgeport, Conn., who is said to be a leading
contender to replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Egan's, Raymond Egan, told today's Daily News that
Egan has already been appointed to the post. ''He asked us not to
say anything because O'Connor was so very, very sick,'' he said.
Egan could not be reached for comment by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Henry Mansell, 62, of Buffalo, N.Y., and Bishop Edwin
O'Brien, 60, the military archbishop, also have been mentioned as
possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at the helm of the nation's most prominent
Roman Catholic pulpit, O'Connor placed himself at the center of
some of the country's most heated debates, angering many with his
staunch support of the Catholic church's positions on abortion and
homosexuality even as he charmed many critics with his warm wit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be greatly missed,'' said Leo Gualtieri, of Queens,
after a Sunday service at the cathedral. ''We hope the next
cardinal will follow in his footsteps.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Says Elian Is Being Drugged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. (AP) -- A U.S. senator said he believes Elian
Gonzalez is being drugged to make him more amenable to returning to
Cuba, and called the Maryland compound where Elian is living ''a
concentration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Sunday, Republican Sen. Bob Smith said the
6-year-old is being ''re-educated'' by Cuban visitors to the
compound in preparation for an asylum hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've already found tranquilizer drugs with the doctors. I
think you can reasonably assume that on May 11 the little kid is
going to come say 'I want to go back to Cuba,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's pediatrician, Dr. Caridad Ponce de Leon, was with a
group of Cubans that flew to the United States on April 27 to spend
time with the boy, whose mother drowned during their escape from
Cuba in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state television reported that U.S. Customs agents took
medicines including tranquilizers from Ponce de Leon upon her
arrival. Authorities said Ponce de Leon cannot practice in Maryland
and will get the medications back when she leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs included the sedative phenobarbital, anti-bacterial
medications and an asthma medication.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said they were part of the doctor's regular
medical kit, and they had no information about what she intended to
do with them.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Smith also said he deplored Elian's living
conditions in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, this little boy is in a concentration camp on
American soil,'' he said. ''It's surrounded by Communists. He's got
his Communist playmates there so they can re-indoctrinate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was traveling, did not immediately return telephone
calls Monday.

<HEADLINE> Fire Burns Near Los Alamos  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A forest fire spread to 5,000 acres
today, forcing hundreds of people from their homes and virtually
shutting down the Los Alamos national nuclear lab.
</P>
<P>
   As the blaze burned about half a mile away, most of the
explosive material at the Los Alamos National Laboratory was safely
protected in nonflammable concrete and metal buildings surrounded
by earthen berms, said John Gustafson, a lab spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The closest radioactive materials were about three miles from
the fire, and those materials also were stored in bunkers designed
to keep fires out, the lab said.
</P>
<P>
   Only essential personnel reported to work today at the lab.
Public schools were closed in Los Alamos County, as were most
businesses in the northern New Mexico town.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,000 people were told to leave their homes or had
already fled as the fire burned out of control, said Steve Coburn,
Los Alamos fire marshal.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was burning in mixed conifer trees and thick stands of
ponderosa pine across several canyons at the foot of the Jemez
Mountains, said Stephen Fettig, a National Parks Service wildlife
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set Thursday to improve the watershed in the
Bandelier National Monument, which is known for its ancient Indian
dwellings and artifacts. On Friday, it jumped fire lines and
scorched about 300 acres, 35 of them outside the area intended to
be burned. Firefighters thought they had it under control Saturday,
but shifting wind rekindled the blaze Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong gusts continued today, blowing ash and thick smoke into
Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ash was falling in the trailer park,'' said Corinne
Cisneros, who was evacuated from a her mobile home on the western
edge of Los Alamos. ''From my kitchen window, when it topped the
mountain, you could see the flames and the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, a bank teller, was sent to the nearby White Rock
Baptist Church, where about 60 evacuees were being matched with
church families who volunteered to give them a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said 400 to 600 people were assigned to battle the fire
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   In south-central New Mexico, a fire that started Sunday in
Ruidoso burned at least 3,500 acres and caused the evacuation of
about 150 homes, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Backs China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a united stand, three former presidents
today joined President Clinton in giving Congress a strong push to
grant China permanent trade benefits. The pact also won an
endorsement from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ''In economic terms, the case is clear,'' said Presidents Ford,
Carter and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in a letter to House Banking and Financial Services
Chairman James Leach, R-Iowa, said he believed passage of the
legislation was ''in the interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our markets are already generally open to China and that will
not be altered (by the China trade bill),'' Greenspan wrote in the
letter released by Leach. Greenspan said passage of the bill to
normalize trade relations with China ''will facilitate a further
opening of China's markets to U.S. producers.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-page letter by the three former presidents came as the
White House, which orchestrated release of the letter, sought more
clout to persuade Congress to extend permanent trade status to
China and ease the Asian nation's long-sought entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agreement to bring China into the WTO is the product of
more than 13 years of tough negotiations conducted by four
administrations, Democratic and Republican,'' Ford, Carter and Bush
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It builds upon a series of market-opening initiatives pursued
by every president since the second world war. It will open China's
markets to us without increasing China's access to our market,''
they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Ford and Carter plan to be at the White House on
Tuesday with former secretaries of state and national security
advisers to rally support for the legislation. If the House
approves the measure in a vote expected later this month, Senate
passage is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and the two top House Democratic leaders are
fighting the legislation, suggesting it will hurt U.S. jobs. The
Clinton administration, Republican leaders and U.S. business groups
have been lobbying lawmakers for weeks to get the legislation
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made significant progress, but there's still much work
to be done,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ''The
endorsement of three former presidents should have a significant
impact on members who are trying to make up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The former presidents said failure to grant China permanent
normal trade relations status would ''squander'' the best
opportunity the United States has had in a generation to address
long-standing concerns about China's trading practices.
</P>
<P>
   They also said it would improve U.S.-China relations, make
positive change within China more likely by opening doors to the
information revolution and speeding up reforms that are dismantling
many state controls over the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vote against PNTR will make it far more difficult to attain
these critical goals,'' the presidents wrote. ''It would encourage
deeper tensions between Beijing and Taiwan and diminish our ability
to work for Asian stability.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 108; Dow Off 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as investors took
some profits from Friday's rally. Technology stocks, which fueled
Friday's gains, led the decline today.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 4.57 at 10,573.29.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 108.10 at 3,708.72 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 10.52 at 1,422.11.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said many investors were selling stocks to capture
short-term gains from a solid rally on Friday, when the Dow rose
165 points and the Nasdaq rose 96. With interest rate worries
settling over Wall Street, many investors appeared reluctant to
take significant new positions. Trading was extremely light.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its next policymaking meeting on
May 16. The Fed has raised interest rates five times since last
June in a series of modest, quarter-percentage point hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money. This time around, however, many analysts believe a heftier
increase could mollify investors because it might signify that the
Fed is finally nearing the end of its cycle of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mostly lower today. Hewlett-Packard fell
2\ to 134{ and Intel fell 5 5/16 to 118 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems fell 4 15/16 to 85 9/16 and PMC-Sierra fell 9
5/16 to 170 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many analysts expect those technology stocks -- among
the most established and best-capitalized -- to regain leadership of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within this environment of lingering interest rate concerns,
we believe stock selection ought to focus on those companies with
strong earnings momentum,'' said John H. Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc. For the most part, Shaughnessy
said, that means technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors remain leery of the volatile technology sector.
Cisco fell 4 17/64 to 63 31/64 after an article in Barron's said
the company's rapid growth rate could slow if Cisco stops acquiring
companies at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks shook off interest-rate worries and helped the
Dow contain its losses. American Express was up 4 9/16 to 150
11/16. The financial sector suffered last week as economic data
pointed to continued growth, raising expectations of a sharp
increase in rates.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 515.61 million
shares, behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, decliners led by an 12-to-7 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.05 to 504.79.

<HEADLINE> 'Kate,' 'Music Man' Lead Tony Nods  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Broadway celebrated old favorites such as ''Kiss
Me, Kate'' and ''The Music Man,'' while snubbing Disney's ''Aida''
and combative actor Patrick Stewart as the Tony Award nominations
were announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kate,'' a revival of the Cole Porter musical adapted from
Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' walked off with 12
nominations, more than any other show, followed by Meredith
Willson's ''The Music Man,'' which received eight.
</P>
<P>
   They face each other in the best musical-revival category, along
with new productions of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Tango
Argentino.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the year of double, triple and, in two cases, quadruple
nominations. Susan Stroman, who directed and choreographed both
''Contact'' and ''The Music Man,'' received four nominations, and
will be competing against herself for best choreography and best
director of a musical. Composer and book writer Michael John
LaChiusa picked up four nominations, two each for his musicals
''Marie Christine'' and ''The Wild Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' three stories told through dance, faces ''The Wild
Party,'' ''James Joyce's The Dead'' and ''Swing!'' for best
musical, and is the early favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The winners, chosen by more than 700 theater professionals and
journalists, will be announced June 4 on CBS. Rosie O'Donnell will
serve as host.
</P>
<P>
   Left out of the running for the top musical prize was ''Aida,''
Disney's lavish retelling of an ancient Egyptian love triangle,
although its star, Heather Headley, was nominated, as were its
composer and lyricist, Elton John and Tim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was passed over for his performance as an unrepentant
bigamist in Arthur Miller's ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan.'' The actor
had sparred publicly with the show's producers over what he
perceived as lack of support for the play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mt. Morgan'' did get a nomination for best play, along with
''Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's drama about the controversial
meeting of two physicists on opposite sides during World War II;
''Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's warm-hearted biography of sex
symbol Mae West; and ''True West,'' Sam Shepard's savage 1970s
comedy about two battling brothers that already has had two
productions off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   For actor, nominators picked the two stars of ''True West,''
Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly; Gabriel Byrne, who
portrays a dissolute actor in ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'';
Stephan Dillane, the adulterous writer in ''The Real Thing''; and
David Suchet, who plays Mozart's rival in ''Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Stewart, also shut out of acting nominations were such
names as Derek Jacobi and Roger Rees of ''Uncle Vanya'' and the two
stars of the critically praised ''Copenhagen,'' Philip Bosco and
Michael Cumpsty.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast of ''Dirty Blonde'' -- Claudia Shear, Kevin
Chamberlain and Bob Stillman -- was nominated in various acting
categories.
</P>
<P>
   For best actress, Shear, who plays Mae West in the show, will
compete against a mother-daughter match-up: Rosemary Harris, who
stars in Noel Coward's ''Waiting in the Wings,'' and her daughter,
Jennifer Ehle, who appears in ''The Real Thing.'' Also nominated
were Cherry Jones, from ''A Moon for the Misbegotten; and Jayne
Atkinson of ''The Rainmaker.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower Monday on low volume
as fears over the telecommunications sector hit bourses while
losses on the Nasdaq Composite weighed on technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Markets across Europe fell in early trading, dragged down by
technology and telecom losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is surprising that the markets did start down after Wall
Street's positive close (Friday),'' said Ben Funnell, strategist at
Merrill Lynch. ''But then some of the U.S. data released was not
great and many on Wall Street are beginning to predict'' a
half-percentage point interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom names fell across Europe from the beginning of trade as
the breakdown of merger talks between KPN of the Netherlands and
Spain's Telefonica sapped investor confidence in a sector already
hurt by the high prices of mobile phone licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of negative sentiment out there, and that is
unlikely to change in the near future,'' said Steve Trowbridge,
telecom analyst at Teather &AMP; Greenwood. ''Investors just do not
know what the bill is yet -- there is a lot of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts predict a week of range-trading across Europe,
with little news to push the market either way; although the
European Central Bank Governing Council meeting will provide some
focus on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, was down 4.2 points at
441.3. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 66.6 points at
5,285.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 0.4 percent to 6,216.3;
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 1.6 percent to 7,408.09; Paris'
CAC-40 Index was down 0.5 percent to 6,514.42; Milan's MIBtel Index
was down 0.6 percent; Amsterdam's AEX Index was down 0.2 percent to
668.87.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Talk Reform With Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Two months after ''Super Tuesday'' decided
their presidential primary fight, the vanquished and the victor are
finally meeting. And John McCain still wants to talk reform with
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's said he's a reformer with results,'' McCain says ''That's
his slogan. I'd like to know what those are and how I can be
helpful in achieving a reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said on Monday, the day before the former Republican
rivals' meeting, ''I'm confident we'll have a conversation that
will cover a lot of subjects, none more important than reform,
reform of our Social Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to talking to John about education and campaign
funding reform,'' he added. ''I don't anticipate any changes on his
part or my part, but there's a lot of area for us on which to agree
and I look forward to having that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and the Texas governor are planning to meet without any
of their staff present. The Arizona senator isn't expected to
endorse Bush on Tuesday, but wait until a separate event later in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that whether we have an endorsement tomorrow or not is
really not what's important,'' Bush said. ''What's important is to
sit down and visit. He has said over and over that he's going to
support me as the nominee of the Republican Party and I take him at
his word.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men's primary campaign included sharp disagreement on
rules covering contributions to political campaigns. McCain favors
greater restriction.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in comments to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said anew
that he did not want to be Bush's vice-presidential running mate,
but he wouldn't rule out all possible posts in a potential Bush
administration, such as defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made it clear I'd prefer to stay in the United States
Senate,'' said McCain. But he added, ''For me to start ruling out
every possibility would be just foolish. You can't say I would
refuse to serve in one of those capacities. It's not the same as
vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would urge Bush to appoint Colin Powell, the former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said there would be ''no demands, no negotiation'' with
Bush when they meet privately at a Pittsburgh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes Bush will defeat Vice President Al Gore in
November and will be a ''great president.'' The meeting Tuesday
will help determine how enthusiastically he supports the campaign,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more things that we agree on than we disagree on,
and I believe he would be a good president of the United States,''
McCain said. ''There is no point in me looking back in rancor or
anger or bitterness in the campaign. It's over.''

Tests confirm that 'date rape' drug sickened four Raritan students
<TEXT>
<P>
   RARITAN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- Laboratory tests confirm that the
so-called ''date rape'' drug sickened four students at Hunterdon
Central Regional High School in March, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon County authorities await results from urine tests of
the students before determining whether to file charges, Capt.

<HEADLINE> Grand Marnier Files Trademark Suit  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- To the makers of Grand Marnier liquor, the
proof of their trademark claim against Silver Palate Kitchens Inc.
is right on the label: ''Fudge Sauce Grand Marnier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cressville, N.J.-based Silver Palate does not have
permission to use the Grand Marnier name, according to the
Paris-based maker of the liquor, Societe des Produits
Marnier-Lapostelle.
</P>
<P>
   The French company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit last
month in U.S. District Court here against Silver Palate, seeking
unspecified monetary damages and an order barring Silver Palate
from using the Grand Marnier name.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can't trade on the reputation or the quality without
getting the consent or getting the license,'' Michael S. Elkin, a
lawyer for Marnier-Lapostelle, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Through an aide, Joyce Hunt, Silver Palate president Peter
Harris said Monday that he believes there should be no lawsuit and
that it is an error. Hunt declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Palate is known for its packaged goods and The Silver
Palate Cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   The label on the sauce, reproduced in the lawsuit, describes the
product as, ''A dark rich sauce with lots of Grand Marnier. Perfect
on chocolate, vanilla or orange ice cream. Pour over cream puffs,
eclairs, dessert souffles, cheesecake or fresh berries.''

<HEADLINE> Six Die From Carbon Monoxide Poison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSLYN HEIGHTS, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who disconnected his household
carbon monoxide detector because it kept going off for no apparent
reason came home to find six people -- including three family
members -- dead of fumes from the furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the air conditioner took in carbon monoxide
from the furnace and pumped it through the house while the victims
slept.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrei Kranz, 42, told police he had disconnected the
detector because he thought it was malfunctioning. He returned home
Sunday morning from an overnight hospital shift to find his
parents, his 2-year-old daughter, two house guests and a baby
sitter dead.
</P>
<P>
   Both the air conditioner and the Long Island home's furnace were
left on by mistake after the weather went quickly from cool to hot,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the air conditioner's intake vents was closed and another
was clogged with leaves, so it could draw air only from the room it
shared with the natural-gas furnace, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Foul play was ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors found Kranz sitting on his lawn crying. He had carried
his daughter's body out of the house in an attempt to revive her,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in shock,'' said neighbor Debbi Annunziata. ''He was
hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranz's wife and 17-year-old daughter were visiting relatives in
Romania. The visitors and the baby sitter were from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz, a resident in radiology at Nassau County Medical Center,
was hospitalized in stable condition Monday because of exposure to
carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could have all been so easily avoided,'' neighbor Donna
Bernstein said after learning that the detector had been turned
off.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the death of tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis, killed
when his Long Island cottage was filled with carbon monoxide from a
swimming pool heater in 1994.

   'Love Bug' Virus Suspect Arrested
</P>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine police today arrested a
bank employee who along with his girlfriend is suspected of links
to the ''ILOVEYOU'' computer virus that has overwhelmed networks
around the world. But relatives of the man, Reomel Ramones, said
they believe the real culprit may be a third person who lived in
the couple's apartment -- the girlfriend's unemployed sister, who
recently graduated from a computer school that a U.S. security firm
has been tied to the ''Love Bug'' virus. Investigators raided the
apartment in Pandacan, a lower-middle-class Manila neighborhood,
and seized computer diskettes, wires, telephones and other computer
accessories, officials said. Two FBI agents accompanied the
investigators in the apartment raid, officials said.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is reported to be exploring a
number of possible alternatives to the government's plan for a
company breakup. The company is due to submit its response to the
government on Wednesday. Spokesman Mark Murray said today it is too
soon to talk publicly about what Microsoft will do. But media
reports suggest it will raise the possibility of allowing computer
makers more flexibility in installing and altering the Windows
operating system. Another possibility is that Microsoft also might
suggest offering a version of Windows without the Internet Explorer
Web browser tied to it. The linkage was one of the first charges
leveled at the company by the U.S. Justice Department and 19 state
attorneys general.

   Treasury Urges Low-Cost Banking
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose this
week a $30 million plan to help low-income people open low-cost,
basic bank accounts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
today. An estimated 10 percent of U.S. households do not have bank
accounts. They are predominantly poor and minority and often
elderly or disabled, according to government officials. Among the
reasons: rising bank and ATM fees, the closing of bank branches in
poor city neighborhoods and rural towns, and mistrust of banks in
general. The administration has noted that the ''unbanked''
population often falls prey to storefront check-cashing services
that charge excessive fees.

distributing polymer products, which can be plastics, rubber,
resins and industrial film. Geon's specialty is vinyl plastics.
When combined, the companies expect to benefit from raw materials
savings, market-related opportunities and overhead reductions by

consideration.'' DaimlerChrysler spokesman Eckhard Zanger said
DaimlerChrysler was not in talks with Hyundai on producing small

Nazi-era forced and slave laborers, a German official said today.
The warning from Otto Lambsdorff, Germany's chief negotiator in
talks on a settlement, was part of growing pressure on the
country's industry to quit stalling on the planned $4.6 billion
fund. German industry agreed last December to chip in half the
total, with the government to pay the other half. But companies
have contributed only $1.3 billion, just over half their share.

losses on the Nasdaq Composite weighed on technology stocks.
Telecom names fell across Europe from the beginning of trade as the
breakdown of merger talks between KPN of the Netherlands and
Spain's Telefonica sapped investor confidence in a sector already
hurt by the high prices of mobile phone licenses. The Dow Jones
Euro Stoxx Index was down 4.2 points at 441.3. London's FTSE-100
Share Index fell 0.4 percent to 6,216.3; Frankfurt's Xetra DAX

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 127; Dow Down 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks sank in a quiet session today as
investors worried about interest rates and took profits from a
modest rally on Friday. Technology stocks led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 21.45 at 10,556.41.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 127.07 at 3,689.75 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 14.13 at 1,418.50.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the most significant action in the market came from
investors selling stocks to capture short-term gains from a solid
rally on Friday, when the Dow rose 165 points and the Nasdaq rose
96.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which led Friday's gains, were mostly lower
today. Hewlett-Packard fell 3 to 133} and Intel fell 5 11/16 to 117
11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems fell 5 5/16 to 85 3/16 and PMC-Sierra fell 12
to 168.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco fell 5{ to 62\ after an article in Barron's said the
company's stunning growth rate could slow if Cisco stops acquiring
companies at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the technology sector, investors stayed resolutely on the
sidelines, pondering the upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve,
which is expected to raise interest rates for the sixth time since
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists expect the Fed to raise rates by as much as a
half-percentage point at its next policymaking meeting on May 16.
The last five rate increases have come in a series of modest,
quarter-percentage point hikes.
</P>
<P>
   While some Wall Street analysts believe investors would welcome
a sharper increase as a sign that the Fed is finally nearing the
end of its cycle of rate increases, the uncertainty has contributed
to a sharp drop in trading activity in the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the entrenched optimism in the market, investors will
not be able to ignore a more aggressive Federal Reserve,'' said
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money. Last week, the rate-sensitive financial sector bore the
brunt of investors' worries and fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Today, financial stocks outperformed the broader market as
investors bought them at reduced prices. American Express was up 4
9/16 to 150 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 607.99 million
shares, behind Friday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 9-to-5 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.37 to
502.47.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- Martin Sheen says he encouraged his son
Emilio Estevez not to direct his other son, newly sober Charlie
Sheen, in a movie about the drug-addled porn industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheen told TV Guide that he was impressed by ''Rated X'' and

star as the Mitchell brothers, two San Francisco porn kings.
Charlie Sheen's character snorts cocaine, chugs vodka and smokes
pot.

   ''There were moments where we were shooting that I thought,
'What am I doing, have him re-create all this madness?''' Estevez

   But both brothers said the filming was cathartic.
</P>

   ''I got to vent a lot of rage, a lot of frustration, a lot of

live that way anymore. I am just grateful to be in the game and

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- Michael J. Fox says he's beginning to feel
the effects of Parkinson's disease.

   ''I'm slower than I was. I'm not as dexterous. I'm as strong as
I was, but not as agile,'' he said in TV Guide's latest issue.

   He said he has grown up a lot since he first learned he had the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to get too mawkish about it, but I didn't become a man

   John is pictured sitting down and staring onto the street,

Clinton's 80-page filing with an attorney disciplinary committee of
the Supreme Court of Arkansas as ''attempting to show that his
testimony was not 'false' as he defines that term.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 26-page response, the private group says that the
president's oft-stated admission that he gave ''misleading''
testimony about his relationship with the former White House intern
is grounds enough to disbar him. The private group also argued that
Clinton, as a public official, is subject to more stringent
standards under Arkansas rules of ethical conduct for attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, ''President
Clinton flatly admits that he misled us all, court and public
alike,'' says the group. ''He admitted it on national television
and he admitted it, repeatedly, in his response to this committee's
formal complaints. Even his own lawyers characterized his testimony
as 'evasive, incomplete and misleading.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's personal attorney, noted that the
foundation gets money from conservative billionaire Richard Scaife
and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr helps raise money for
the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''The foundation isn't interested in issues relating to Arkansas
lawyers and legal services, it's just interested in attacking the
president in any way it can,'' he said. ''Releasing its paper to
the public is just another part of the long-running partisan
mudslinging campaign against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's court papers say that in calling for ''a mere
reprimand,'' Clinton ''ignores the plain language of the ... most
obvious, analogous case of presidential misconduct, that of Richard
Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was disbarred by a New York court despite the absence of
criminal conviction or impeachment conviction. He resigned before a
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In their still-unreleased court filing late last month,
Clinton's lawyers reviewed hundreds of attorney disciplinary cases
in Arkansas to suggest ''that a sanction no harsher and perhaps
more lenient than a letter of reprimand would be appropriate,''
foundation president Matt Glavin said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ''is no ordinary Arkansas lawyer,'' the group said in
its filing. ''Rather, he is the president of the United States of
America and, as such, is held to the model rules requiring the
higher ethical standard for attorneys who hold public office, even
those who may become litigants or defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''What goes unacknowledged'' by Clinton ''is the tremendous
damage that his misconduct has caused to the courts and legal
profession in Arkansas and throughout the country,'' the group
added. ''It is that consequence of the president's misconduct that
he must particularly answer for.''
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that Clinton paid $90,000 and never challenged a
civil contempt finding by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber
Wright that he lied when he denied a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky and testified he couldn't recall being alone with the
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Imposing fines for civil contempt ''does not mitigate the need
to protect the integrity of the legal system,'' said the group,
which filed the first complaint seeking revocation of Clinton's
Arkansas law license on Sept. 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A second complaint arose automatically under state law when
Wright found Clinton in contempt on April 12, 1999, for lying about
his sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Both complaints focus on Clinton's statements about Lewinsky in
the January 17, 1998, deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.

<HEADLINE> Boccardi, Gore Address AP Members  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Plans to enhance The Associated Press' state
news coverage and Internet presence were announced today by Louis
D. Boccardi, president and chief executive officer, at the news
cooperative's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was attended by executives representing AP's 1,546
member newspapers on the first full day of the Newspaper
Association of America's convention. The meeting also featured a
panel on the 2000 election and talks by Vice President Al Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   AP Chairman Donald E. Newhouse called the meeting to order, and
Boccardi reported on the state of AP.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi assured the convention that the coming year would bring
''an ever-stronger world and national news report; further
exploration of the opportunities and challenges the Internet
presents, (and) sharper focus on better performance on all
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi specifically mentioned the AP's state reports as a
target for enhancements. The company is adding two new
Chicago-based positions in that regard: a writing coach, the AP's
third, and a deputy director of state news.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited the introduction of a Web site called the AP
Election Center, ''for online readers who want as much detail as
they can get on the candidates, the issues and the campaigns, from
the White House to this interesting little thing we've got going on
in New York state this year.'' He was referring to the U.S. Senate
race between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Several other initiatives related to the Internet were mentioned
by Boccardi, including forthcoming delivery of the state reports in
a format that enables editors of online editions to post them
easily to newspaper Web sites, and the addition of Web site
addresses at the bottom of many AP stories.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, told the
executives that he would accept invitations from any newspaper to
debate likely GOP opponent George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president added that he would keep ''an open mind'' on
whether current FCC regulations banning dual ownership of a
newspaper and a television or radio station in a single market
should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore said he would consider revising estate tax laws that
make it difficult for families to maintain ownership of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the news cooperative also heard from Alan Diaz,
the photographer who took the AP photographs inside the house where
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez was seized by federal agents late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the raid, ''I had the instinct, the hunch,
that something was going to go down,'' Diaz said. When the raid
began, he immediately sprinted into the house and set up in the
room where the boy was being hidden in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   His overriding memory of the raid? ''All I could hear, and all I
could remember, was Elian crying,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi also moderated a discussion of political campaigns with
three AP correspondents. The panel, titled ''A Conversation:
Campaign 2000,'' includes Walter Mears, AP vice president and
Washington columnist; Ron Fournier, chief political writer in
Washington; and Marc A. Humbert, New York State political editor
based in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert, talking about the New York senate race between Giuliani
and Clinton, said the battle between the two was already
''intense'' -- and it promised not to let up.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to be so sick of seeing Rudy Giuliani and Hillary
Clinton ads on television that come November, you probably won't
want to vote for either of them,'' Humbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, the featured speaker at the luncheon following the
meeting, spoke about some of the most controversial areas of
foreign policy in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   She said the upcoming vote in Congress on whether to create
normal trade relations with China ''may well be the most
significant economic and national security decision Congress faces
this year.'' On the conflict in the Balkans, she said she was
certain U.S. involvement had been ''the right thing,'' but added:
''We admit we made a mistake when we said our forces would be out
of there in a year. It was an artificial deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about recent scandals at the State Department over
security lapses, she said: ''I was both angered and embarrassed ...
On behalf of all employees of the state Department, I'm
humiliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the meeting began with the announcement of election
results for the board of directors, held by all-mail balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Four incumbents and three new members were elected to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to new terms were John J. Curley, chairman and CEO,
Gannett Co. Inc., Wilmington (Del.) News-Journal; Newhouse,
president, Advance Publications Inc., Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger;
John W. Madigan, chairman, president and CEO, Tribune Co., Chicago
Tribune and Orage Quarles III, publisher, Raleigh (N.C.) News &AMP;
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   New members are Walter E. Hussman Jr., president and CEO, WEHCO
Media Inc., Arkansas Democrat-Gazette; Julie Inskeep Walda,
publisher, Fort Wayne (Ind.) Journal Gazette; and Sue Mayborn,
president and publisher, Temple (Texas) Daily Telegram. Walda was
selected to fill one year left in the term of Richard J.
Harrington, who is stepping down. Mayborn was selected to represent
a city of less than 50,000 population.

<HEADLINE> Funeral recalls Cardinal O'Connor as great churchman  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor's life was celebrated at
a funeral Mass today marked by pageantry, prayer, hope and an
outpouring of love for the man who served the archdiocese's 2.4
million Catholics for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon
rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit,
and an outrageous sense of humor, all of which he used in the
service of preaching,'' Cardinal Bernard Law, of the Archdiocese of
Boston, said during the homily.
</P>
<P>
   Law, a close friend of O'Connor's, said the cardinal was so
dedicated that in the last weeks of his life, though his sight had
failed and his speech was slurred O'Connor was still able to recite
''with strength and conviction'' by memory the Eucharistic prayer,
where gifts of bread and wine are offered symbolizing the body and
blood of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much was the Mass a part of his life that when some things
began to fade, the Eucharist did not,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly three-hour service began with a procession of 800,
including hundreds of priests, 120 bishops and 15 cardinals, making
their way through the great bronze doors of St. Patrick's Cathedral
where an estimated 3,500 invited mourners gathered, including
President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As she entered the church, U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy remembered
O'Connor as a priest who reached out to all. After her husband was
killed in a Long Island Rail Road shooting, McCarthy received a
letter from the cardinal, telling her the tragedy would take her on
a different path. She went on to run for Congress and lobby for
more stringent gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what made him a great man,'' she said as she entered
the cathedral. ''He always reached out to ordinary people. It
didn't matter what religion you were. He was truly a shepherd to
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the cathedral, hundreds of people stood
eight to 10 deep, weathering 91-degree heat, some under umbrellas,
to listen to the service over loudspeakers. A Red Cross truck was
stationed nearby passing out water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew Cardinal O'Connor. He was a man gifted by God with
wisdom and understanding,'' said Joan Gray Jangarathis, of Short
Hills, N.J., who attends regular Sunday Mass at St. Patrick's. ''I
had to be here today. It's the Mass of resurrection and God gives
us hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dignitaries who attended included Vice President Al Gore,
former President George Bush, Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and
ex-Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's closed coffin, covered in a white linen cloth, sat in
the center aisle in front of the majestic church. On top, lay the
cardinal's personal crucifix and a book of the Gospel. Many during
the 45-minute processional placed a hand on the coffin as they
passed by.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Angelo Sodano, sent by Pope John Paul II to represent
the Vatican, carried O'Connor's staff in the procession. Sodano,
the Vatican's secretary of state, presided at the ceremony, which
according to Catholic guidelines focuses on celebrating O'Connor's
new life in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Sodano offered the service ''as a sacrifice of praise to
almighty God who has given us in the person of the Archbishop of
New York such a generous and faithful pastor.'' He called O'Connor
a great churchman whose name would be forever etched in the annals
of the Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hearts are heavy with sorrow at his passing,'' Sodano said
but urged those gathered to recall a prayer that says: ''Lord, we
do not complain because you have taken him from us but rather we
will thank you for having given him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first reading from the Bible's Old Testament was offered by
Mother Agnes Donovan, head of the Bronx-based Sisters of Life, an
order of nuns founded by O'Connor 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday of brain cancer. At the end of the
service, an eight-man honor guard solemnly carried O'Connor's
casket through the church, allowing mourners to pray and offer a
final good-bye. The church erupted in applause as the casket was
taken down a narrow staircase to a crypt beneath St. Patrick's
altar, where all previous archbishops of New York are buried.
</P>
<P>
   His coffin will be placed near that of Pierre Toussaint, a
19th-century Haitian whose cause for sainthood was supported by
O'Connor. That portion of the ceremony will be private, with only
O'Connor's relatives and a small group of church officials present.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor helped plan the funeral, handpicking many of the songs
and prayers. The music included ''Ave Maria,'' sung by Metropolitan
Opera soprano Heidi Grant Murphy and ''Lift High the Cross,'' the
hymn sung when O'Connor was installed as head of the New York
Archdiocese, which stretches 4,700 square miles and includes three
counties in New York City and seven north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, hundreds of people filed into St. Patrick's
Cathedral to pay tribute to O'Connor, hours before his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   More mourners had gathered on the steps outside for other
scheduled Masses and a public viewing, which were canceled at 8
a.m. to give church officials and the Secret Service time to secure
the area, archdioceses spokesman Joe Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House this morning, President Clinton praised
O'Connor for his work as a chaplain in the armed services and then
as the leader of the New York archdiocese, the nation's third
largest Catholic diocese. Los Angeles is the largest and Chicago is
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he set a very large role in the life of the church,
and even when he was controversial and when he disagreed with me, I
liked the fact that he was outspoken and he stood up for what he
believed in,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking after the annual Associated Press meeting here,
called O'Connor a friend and said he was supportive during his wife
Tipper's campaign to include parental advisories on music albums.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, tens of thousands of mourners attended
Masses and the public viewing to say good-bye to O'Connor, who once
said he hoped his epitaph would simply read: ''He was a good
priest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was important for me to be here. I wanted to pray for him
and let him know that he was very kind, good to the poor people,
the Spanish people,'' Yolanda O. Velez said this morning after
walking through the cathedral and past the cardinal's body, lying
in a velvet-lined coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many bishops attending the service was Bishop Edward
Michael Egan, 68, of Bridgeport, Conn., who is said to be a leading
contender to replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Egan's, Raymond Egan, told today's Daily News that
Egan has already been appointed to the post. ''He asked us not to
say anything because O'Connor was so very, very sick,'' he said.
Egan could not be reached for comment by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Henry Mansell, 62, of Buffalo, N.Y., and Bishop Edwin
O'Brien, 60, the military archbishop, also have been mentioned as
possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at the helm of the nation's most prominent
Roman Catholic pulpit, O'Connor placed himself at the center of
some of the country's most heated debates, angering many with his
staunch support of the Catholic church's positions on abortion and
homosexuality even as he charmed many critics with his warm wit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be greatly missed,'' said Leo Gualtieri, of Queens,
after a Sunday service at the cathedral. ''We hope the next
cardinal will follow in his footsteps.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Urges Low-Cost Banking  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a $30
million plan to help millions of low-income people open low-cost,
basic bank accounts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 percent of U.S. households, or some 10 million
families, do not have bank accounts. They are predominantly poor
and minority and often elderly or disabled, according to government
officials. Among the reasons: rising bank and ATM fees, the closing
of bank branches in poor city neighborhoods and rural towns, and
distrust of banks in general.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has expressed concern about this ''unbanked''
population for some time, saying they often fall prey to storefront
check-cashing services that charge excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''First Accounts'' plan will be proposed to
Congress this week, Summers said in a speech to the Consumer
Bankers Association, an industry group. It would provide subsidies
such as tax incentives to banks, thrifts and credit unions to offer
low-cost, ''no frills'' checking accounts for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working together, we should ensure that all low-income
Americans have access to the types of financial products that the
rest of us take for granted,'' Summers said. ''All individuals
should be able to cash their checks without paying high fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks also would get subsidies for expanding ATM machines in
poorer neighborhoods, a service which banks have complained is too
expensive, and Internet banking for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes a public education campaign for
financial literacy in poorer communities.
</P>
<P>
   During congressional debate last year on major banking
legislation, some liberal Democrats, led by Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., pushed for an amendment that would have required banks to
offer low-cost accounts for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal, by contrast, wouldn't require banks to
offer the accounts but would give them a financial incentive to do
so. It may have stronger prospects for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is ''something we'll take a look at,'' said David
Runkel, a spokesman for Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman of
the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said his
group supports the Clinton proposal but added: ''It's a shame that
we actually have to pay the banks to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said
many banks have been offering basic checking accounts for years but
that it is difficult to get low-income people to use them.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska, W.Va. Primaries Are Tues.  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Two top Republican state officials are
battling it out in Tuesday's primary for a chance to fill the seat
being vacated by the only Democrat in Nebraska's congressional
delegation -- Sen. Bob Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Don Stenberg and Secretary of State Scott Moore
are expected to lead the GOP primary race, which is now down to
four candidates after two deep-pocketed contenders stopped
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The winner is likely to take on former Gov. Ben Nelson, who left
office in 1999 with an 80 percent approval rating after two terms.
He faced token opposition in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In other races Tuesday, former University of Nebraska football
coach Tom Osborne, the most popular person in this football-crazy
state, has two opponents in a GOP congressional primary.
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood faces a
painting contractor, a housewife and an unemployed construction
worker in the GOP primary. Underwood, 77, was so confident that he
did not campaign and planned to spend election night watching a
minor league baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic West Virginia race was for the House seat
being left by Rep. Bob Wise, who is running in the Democratic
primary to challenge Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   Four Democrats are vying for the seat Wise has held since 1982 --
including Secretary of State Ken Hechler, an 85-year-old former
congressman whose political career dates back to the New Deal. He
faces popular state Sen. Martha Walker, Harrison County
Commissioner Beth Taylor and lawyer Jim Humphreys, who spent $3
million of his own money and leads in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will take on Republican Shelley Moore Capito, a
member of the state House of Delegates and the daughter of former
Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., the state's only three-term governor.
</P>
<P>
   There are also presidential primaries Tuesday in Nebraska and
West Virginia, but both are essentially meaningless since Al Gore
and George W. Bush have sealed their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, Republicans were giddy when Kerrey, a rare Democrat
in the conservative state, declined to run for a third term. Kerrey
instead will become president of New School University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg, who recently defended Nebraska's ban against so-called
partial birth abortions before the Supreme Court, had been running
for the Senate for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey's decision also prompted Moore, one of Stenberg's
most prominent backers, to enter the race. Moore has raised
$224,000 this year, compared with $144,000 for Stenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Agribusinessman David Hergert and former state Sen. John DeCamp
are also on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nelson's popularity, the Republicans -- who tried to woo
him to switch parties in 1998 -- know he can be beat. Nelson lost a
Senate race in 1996 to Chuck Hagel.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne considered running for the GOP Senate nomination but
instead decided to seek the House seat held by Republican Bill
Barrett, who is retiring after five terms.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's opponents, longtime state GOP leader John Gale and
state Board of Education member Kathy Wilmot, have tried not to let
the former coach's celebrity hinder their campaigns. And the race
has mainly focused on the issues -- namely the struggling farm
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters clearly are fascinated with Osborne, who coached
Nebraska for a quarter-century and led the Cornhuskers to three
national championships in the 1990s. He would face Democrat Rollie
Reynolds in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people in the state of Nebraska have had a chance to
see me operate up close and personal for 25 years,'' Osborne said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hailed by friends and followers at a touching
funeral Mass, Cardinal John O'Connor arrived Monday at his final
resting place beneath St. Patrick's Cathedral -- completing his
journey from local priest to the nation's most prominent Roman
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton headed a long list of dignitaries attending
the funeral Mass for O'Connor, who came to New York in 1984 from
Scranton, Pa. O'Connor proved a perfect fit in the media capital of
the nation, serving as Pope John Paul II's American point man.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made this pulpit unique in the history of the Catholic
Church in the United States,'' said Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston,
a close friend and confidante of O'Connor for the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon
rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit and
an outrageous sense of humor -- all of which he used in the service
of preaching,'' Law said in a heartfelt homily.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, though Vatican secretary of state Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, sent his condolences to O'Connor's family. Speaking at the
start of the service, Sodano -- who carried the late cardinal's
staff into the church -- sounded a theme of celebration rather than
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord, we don't complain because you have taken him from us,''
Sodano told a hushed crowd of 3,500 inside the great Manhattan
cathedral. ''But rather we will thank you for giving him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass combined pageantry and prayer, opening with a 45-minute
procession of O'Connor's fellow clergy. Each passing priest gently
touched the cardinal's coffin, which was draped with a white linen
cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the priests wore special vestments designed for the
pope's 1995 visit to New York. Among those in attendance was Bishop
Edward Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., the perceived front-runner to
replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, O'Connor's dark wood casket was
splashed with holy water, symbolic of the sacrament of baptism. It
was then carried by pallbearers to a crypt beneath the altar where
O'Connor had preached most Sundays for the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The church erupted in spontaneous applause for the cardinal just
before the casket disappeared from the church. A one-legged boy,
propping himself up on small crutches, stood clapping in the aisle
as the casket went past.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was involved in planning the funeral, handpicking many
of the songs and prayers. The recessional hymn, ''Lift High the
Cross,'' was performed when O'Connor was installed as head of the
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was often most at ease among the sick and poor of his
2.4 million member flock, but his funeral prompted an outpouring of
high-profile mourners at the invitation-only Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Attending were Clinton and his wife, Hillary; former President
George Bush; presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush;
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan; U.S. Senators Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer; Gov. George Pataki; Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani; and 15 cardinals from the Vatican, the United
States and four other countries.
</P>
<P>
   There were also those whose lives the cardinal had touched. U.S.
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy was a Long Island housewife in 1993 when her
husband was killed and her son critically wounded by a gunman on
the Long Island Rail Road.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal sent her a letter offering his sympathy but
promising the shootings would change the path of her life. McCarthy
was subsequently elected to Congress as an antigun candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what made him a great man,'' she said. ''He always
reached out to ordinary people. It didn't matter what religion you
were. He was truly a shepherd to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, on a sweltering 91-degree day, hundreds of
people stood 8-to-10 deep behind police barricades as the funeral
Mass was broadcast over loudspeakers. Over the previous four days,
tens of thousands of New Yorkers visited O'Connor's open casket to
pay their final respects.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, died last Wednesday after a lengthy battle with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, an honor guard carried O'Connor's casket down a
narrow staircase to a crypt beneath St. Patrick's altar, where all
previous archbishops of New York are buried.
</P>
<P>
   His coffin was placed near that of Pierre Toussaint, a
19th-century Haitian whose cause for sainthood was supported by
O'Connor. That portion of the ceremony was private, with only
O'Connor's relatives and a small group of church officials present.

<HEADLINE> Dog days of spring for zoo animals as heat wave continues  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE, N.J. (AP) -- The goats hid under a wooden
walkway, cowering from the midday sun. Tosh, a 350-pound Bengal
tiger, lolled around in the shade, pausing only for an occasional
dip in his pool.
</P>
<P>
   In another corral, the emus waited for zookeeper Sheri Hickok to
spray them down. Then the big flightless birds stepped into the
puddles that the water had made to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   So it went Monday at the Cape May County Park &AMP; Zoo, where
animals shifted into slow motion and zoo visitors doused themselves
with bottled water to keep cool. As a spring heat wave beat on for
a third day, living things big and small did their best to cope
with 90-degree temperatures and high humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ''They definitely don't like the heat, especially happening this
early in the season,'' said Hickok. ''Most of these animals, you've
got to give them a little help. We hose down the birds of prey, and
we make little mud puddles for the pigs, because they don't sweat
and they need help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The panda bears hate the heat. They don't like being hosed or
misted, either, so we put ice blocks in their cages so they can rub
up against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo enthusiasts, who paid $1 for bottled water, used much of it
on their own heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to stay in the shade and drink plenty of water,''
said Jedon Lilliston of Oceanview, who was with her 4-year-old son,
Johnny. ''We've already been in the sprinkler at home, so we
decided to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The animals, meanwhile, took a smarter approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is that saying? 'Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in
the noonday sun?' Animals are smarter than people. When it gets
hot, they get in the shade,'' said Bill Sturm, director of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgeton, workers at the Cohanzick Zoo were fighting a
similar battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bears and tigers have air conditioning in their buildings,
so they're OK,'' said zoo curator John Swank. ''For the reindeer,
we provide misters, which spray water. For the chinchillas, we
freeze two-liter bottles of water and put them in their cages. They
can rub against them if they want. But generally, all the animals
are much less active in the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlantic City International Airport, a 90-degree high
tied a 36-year-old record for May 8, according to the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''This heat is above normal, but not unusual,'' said
meteorologist Bill Christ. ''Normally, we should be in the high 70s
at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   No relief is in sight until Wednesday or Thursday, he said.

<HEADLINE> Wet Outlook Dampens Grain, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices tumbled Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after forecasts called for significant rain
in the central United States this week.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend rains set previously bullish investors back on their
heels to start the week, and a selloff ensued when midday forecasts
said as much as two inches of rain might fall on the Midwest this
week. The soggy weather would wash away some of the concerns about
a severe drought impact this year.
</P>
<P>
   Corn took the biggest fall, with America's top crop already
largely planted and particularly vulnerable to dry soil conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also plunged, but less steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat was pressured by the declines in corn and soybeans as well
as the wet forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery fell 4 cents to $2.68} a bushel; July
corn fell 7\ cents to $2.41 a bushel; July oats fell 1} cent to
$1.23\ a bushel; July soybeans fell 7 cents to $5.59 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures retreated.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle fell .05 cent to 68.57 cents a pound; August
feeder cattle rose .40 cent to 85.17 cents a pound; June lean hogs
fell .48 cent to 74.17 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .68
cent to 93.57 cents a pound.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a year of inflation of political claims by
both parties, Republicans had an unusual reaction to a recent
primary election in Indiana. They basically surrendered in their
effort to knock out first term Democratic Rep. Baron Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a not a targeted race we're now looking at for the
fall,'' said Jim Wilkinson, a spokesman for the GOP campaign
committee. As if to underscore the point, the GOP issued a written
statement that spoke enthusiastically of its chances for victory in
other Indiana contests. It omitted mention of Hill's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP had long touted Hill as a potential victim, but
congressional party leaders' hopes soured when Kevin Kellems, a
former aide to Sen. Richard Lugar, lost the nomination. Some GOP
strategists view the winner in the primary, Michael Bailey, as too
much a one-note candidate to defeat Hill. Bailey is a longtime
anti-abortion crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ''I encourage Christians to invade politics,'' Bailey said
recently. ''Every time we run, we force the party a little bit to
the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has become known for graphic anti-abortion commercials
depicting images of dead fetuses. In victory, he pledged to broaden
his campaign platform, and said he will advocate gun rights and
oppose free trade and legal recognition of homosexual unions.
</P>
<P>
   A gain of six seats would give Democrats control of the Senate.
Like several other states, Indiana has enough competitive races to
assure plenty of attention from the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insist they have a chance to defeat three-term
incumbent John Hostettler. Hostettler will face Paul Perry, a
surgeon who largely financed his own campaign, in November. Perry
defeated John Hamilton, a nephew of ex-Rep. Lee Hamilton, to win
the Democrats' nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''His profile on the issues fits the distict,'' Erik Smith,
spokesman for the Democratic Campaign Committee, said about Perry,
who opposes both abortions and gun control. ''Hostettler has not
had to run against a candidate who is this conservative before.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans issued a statement saying Perry's views on health
care and other issues ''are extreme and out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Another oddity in a fiercely contrested election is the growing
number of lawmakers running without major party opposition. The
list now totals 36, divided equally between Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to escape major party opposition include Republicans
John Linder of Georgia and three GOP members from Alabama: Sonny
Callahan, Bob Riley and Spencer Bachus.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Bud Cramer of Alabama is without a GOP opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of legislation to grant permanent normal trade
relations to China are counting on last week's vote on a different
subject to boost their cause. Democratic strategists say they
expect that the vote to establish trade rules with Africa will ease
the way for senior Democratic on the House Ways and Means
Committee, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, to join supporters of
the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel is officially uncommitted, but a spokesman, Dan Maffei,
said ''getting Africa helps, insofar as it frees (him) up to focus
on the pros and cons of granting PNTR to China.'' Maffei said the
New Yorker also is closely following an effort by Rep. Sander
Levin, D-Mich., to include in the legislation a commission to
monitor China's record on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Africa trade bill, expected to clear the Senate this week
and be signed by President Clinton, would to give economically
struggling sub-Saharan nations better access to American markets
and open up trade with Caribbean states as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel is in line to become chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, with access over taxes, trade and welfare issues, should
Democrats win the House in November's elections. The party's two
top leaders in the House oppose the China trade measure.

<HEADLINE> Pair swap driving duties during 20-mile chase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- A man and a woman heading to court on
Monday stole a truck and led officers on a 20-mile chase that
reached speeds of about 100 mph before crashing, the Middlesex
County sheriff said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, who switched driving duties during the chase,
sideswiped several vehicles while speeding up the New Jersey
Turnpike, before the truck flipped at exit 13, Sheriff Joseph C.
Spicuzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Orlando Santiago and Stacey A. Berman had suspended
driver's licenses, and Santiago had a prior conviction for eluding
police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago attempted to run and was caught; Berman was injured, he
said. Both were taken to University Hospital in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a 20-year-old from Rahway, suffered a severe cut on
her right arm was admitted, hospital spokesman Rogers Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, a 27-year-old, from Union, had a cut left wrist and was
released into the custody of sheriff's officers and taken to the
Middlesex County Jail, Spicuzzo said. Numerous charges are being
considered against both, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were to appear in East Brunswick Municipal Court on drug
charges when ''they apparently changed their mind'' and stole a
pickup truck loaded with grass clippings that was parked at an
apartment building by the township complex, Spicuzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, two of his investigators driving nearby on Route 18
northbound heard about the theft on their police radio, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the hot line message came on the air, they found
themselves right behind the truck,'' Spicuzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Berman was driving at the time, and she refused to pull over for
the investigators, who pulled alongside, yelled and showed their
badges because they were in an unmarked station wagon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They followed the truck onto the turnpike at exit 9, notified
state police and saw Santiago take over the driving, Spicuzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They started to reach some high speeds, and over the radio I
ordered them to back off,'' the sheriff said. ''I just wanted them
to keep them in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   After sideswiping three or four cars, the blue 1994 Ford F250
pickup flipped by exit 13, he said.

<HEADLINE> No Upper Limits on Cancer Tests  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The advice sounds unequivocal: Get a cancer
test, it could save your life. Indeed, Pap smears, mammograms and
other cancer screenings do save thousands of lives by detecting
cancer early enough to treat, even cure.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the push to get more people tested is a tricky
question: When are you old enough to quit routine cancer screening?
</P>
<P>
   It's such a murky issue that most cancer guidelines don't even
mention it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't gotten that much attention,'' says Dr. William C.
Black of Dartmouth Medical School, who analyzed federal health
statistics to conclude the life-saving benefits of cancer screening
fall to a startling low around age 75 and continue dropping with
each birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The small benefit of screening in the elderly may be
outweighed by the harms: anxiety, additional testing and
unnecessary treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough issue, and one growing in importance as the
population ages, says Dr. Robert A. Smith of the American Cancer
Society, which hasn't set upper age limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any way that we can make cancer screening more rational and
still ensure the best outcome for the majority of individuals at
risk is worth pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer organizations generally agree on when screening starts:
Pap smears to detect cervical cancer begin around age 18, and
mammograms to spot breast cancer start at 40. Colon cancer tests
start around 50, as do PSA or ''prostate specific antigen'' tests.
People are urged to start screening sooner if cancer runs in the
family or they have other high risks.
</P>
<P>
   Left unanswered is when people become too old to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the very sick skip the tests. But many elderly people
are active and healthy. The average 75-year-old has about 12 years
of potential life left; some will hit 100.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of getting cancer increases with age. But so does the
risk of other killers; the elderly are most likely to die of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, screening tests are becoming better, able to
detect the very tiniest tumors -- ones that may never grow fast
enough to truly threaten an elderly person. Yet treating those
tumors can cause serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Black used mortality statistics to analyze life expectancy of
people who undergo breast, cervical and colon cancer screening.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up mammograms or the fecal occult blood test for colon
cancer would cost the average 75-year-old only nine days of life,
Black reported in last month's journal Effective Clinical Practice.
Quitting at age 80 cost five days of life.
</P>
<P>
   The average woman who gives up Pap smears at age 75 would lose
three days.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, 50-year-olds getting mammograms live on average
43 days longer than those who skip the tests, Black reported.
</P>
<P>
   Remember those numbers average the whole population -- the vast
majority of people screened get the good news that they don't have
cancer, thus diluting the overall impact of tests that can save
individuals' lives. Instead, the important finding is the dramatic
age difference that shows the tests' importance wanes with time,
Black stressed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first study to cast such doubt. University of
California, San Francisco, researchers have argued there's no
evidence to recommend continued mammograms for most women 70 and
older, yet one study found 50,000 women ages 85 and older still get
regular mammograms. It's not just a breast cancer issue -- whether
to treat prostate cancer in very old men is a huge controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer society's Smith cautions against quitting screening
just because you reach a certain age, saying healthy elderly people
in particular can benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But Black urges elderly Americans to thoroughly question their
doctors: Will taking this test help me live longer, given my
medical history? Are there signs I'm a good candidate to skip a
certain test? For example, reaching 65 or 70 without catching the
human papillomavirus that causes most cervical cancer might make
skipping Pap smears an easy choice.
</P>
<P>
   Make an informed decision, understanding that screening may
require more tests or biopsies to separate cancer from a benign
tumor, and that some tumors may never prove lifethreatening, Black
says.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges he's raising a controversial issue. ''I'm not
looking for trouble, I'm just trying to talk straight.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Iranian Jews Confess to Spying  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- Two more defendants confessed Monday in the
trial of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel, officials
said, while their lawyers were shown the state's evidence for the
first time in the closed-door proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The new confessions raise to five the number of defendants who
have reportedly admitted to espionage. But defense lawyers have
questioned the admissions before the Iranian revolutionary court,
where there is no jury and the judge is also the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Western nations have also expressed concern about the fairness
of the proceedings, while Israel has denied the spying charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern city of Shiraz on Monday, defendant Nasser
Levihaim told the court he was the No. 2 man of the spy ring and
asked for clemency, provincial judiciary chief Hossein Ali Amiri
said. Amiri would not identify a ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   Levihaim, 50, who worked for the national power company, was
motivated by ideological reasons and ''love for the promised
land,'' defense lawyer Esmail Naseri said after the closed hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he held a position of authority and was not
responsible for gathering information himself,'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramin Farzam, a 27-year-old store clerk, appeared before the
court for the first time Monday to say he was paid by the Jewish
state to spy but was caught before he could relay any information.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious relatives waited outside the courthouse in Shiraz, 550
miles south of the capital, Tehran, as Farzam, Levihaim and
defendant Shahrokh Paknahad, who confessed last week, attended the
day's session.
</P>
<P>
   Paknahad, 30, told reporters Monday that he sent information he
had gathered to Israel either by ''transmission equipment'' of an
unspecified kind or through Iranian Jews clandestinely traveling to
Israel. Iran bans contact of any kind with Israel, its arch foe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's treatment has been fair,'' Paknahad said. ''I was
not beaten, and I was not under pressure during the investigation
and trial. My confessions were voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recording broadcast on state-run Tehran television on
Monday, Paknahad said his missions were ''to recruit new agents to
spy for Israel and collecting information for sabotage.'' Unshaven
and wearing a gray prison suit, he said he collected information
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war when he was completing military
service, mandatory for all Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Another defendant, shoe salesman Dani Tefilin, has said he spied
for Israel, and a fifth, store clerk Ramin Nematizadeh, confessed
in court, according to his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Naseri, the defense lawyer, has said the defense is based on
proving that no classified information had changed hands. He says
none of the defendants had access to secret information.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw the evidence for the first time today, but cannot
comment on it because it involves state secrets,'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys for the 13 Jews asked Monday that the hearings
in their case be open, but a judiciary official said the judge in
the closed-door trial was unlikely to agree to the request. Amiri
told reporters that the judiciary, which is dominated by
hard-liners, would ''not surrender to any political pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawyers demanded the trial be opened to all reporters, and
the judge said he will consider it,'' Amiri said. ''But I don't
think he'll accept and open the trial sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began last month, is expected to last a few
more weeks. It comes amid a power struggle pitting moderates loyal
to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami against hard-liners opposed
to the president's reformist policy, which favors rapprochement
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to death, the
maximum penalty for passing secret information that damages
national security. Two Jews were hanged three years ago on similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has a policy of fierce opposition to Israel. About 80,000
Jews lived in Iran before the 1979 Islamic revolution; 25,000
remain today. Jews are generally allowed to practice their religion
freely, but like all Iranians, they cannot travel to or have any
contact with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Low-Cost Bank Accounts Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a $30
million plan to help millions of poor people open low-cost basic
bank accounts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of U.S. households, or 10 million families, do
not have bank accounts. They are predominantly poor and from racial
or ethnic minorities and often are elderly or disabled. Among
reasons they give for failure to have accounts are rising bank and
ATM fees, the closing of bank branches in poor city neighborhoods
and rural towns and general distrust of banks.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators have worried for some time about the people
without accounts, who often fall prey to storefront check-cashing
services that charge excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Consumer Bankers Association, an industry group,
Summers said the so-called ''First Accounts'' plan will be proposed
to Congress this week. It would provide subsidies such as tax
incentives to banks, thrifts and credit unions that offer low-cost,
''no-frills'' checking accounts for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working together, we should ensure that all low-income
Americans have access to the types of financial products that the
rest of us take for granted,'' Summers said. ''All individuals
should be able to cash their checks without paying high fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks also would get subsidies for expanding the numbers of ATM
machines in poorer neighborhoods, a service that banks have
complained is too expensive, and Internet banking for lower-income
people.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes a public education campaign for
financial literacy in poorer communities.
</P>
<P>
   During congressional debate last year on major banking
legislation, some liberal Democrats, led by Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., pushed for an amendment to require banks to offer
low-cost accounts for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal, by contrast, wouldn't require banks to
offer the accounts but would give them financial incentives to do
so. It may have stronger prospects for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is ''something we'll take a look at,'' said David
Runkel, a spokesman for Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the
House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said his
group supports the Clinton proposal but added: ''It's a shame that
we actually have to pay the banks to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said
many banks have been offering basic checking accounts for years,
but it is difficult to get low-income people to use them.

<HEADLINE> 3 Ex-Presidents Back China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton turned up the pressure on
Congress to grant permanent trade status to China, recruiting three
former presidents and a highly respected Republican central banker
to stand with him in staunch support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush on Monday wrote an open letter
backing legislation to grant permanent normal trade relations to
China. Shoring up support on the right, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said he too is behind the measure, which would ease
the communist nation's long-desired entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''In economic terms, the case is clear,'' the former presidents
wrote in their two-page letter released by the White House. ''The
agreement to bring China into the WTO is the product of more than
13 years of tough negotiations conducted by four administrations,
Democratic and Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ford and Carter will join President Clinton, Vice
President Al Gore, former secretaries of state, including Henry
Kissinger, and former national security advisers at the White House
to rally support for the legislation. And the Democratic Leadership
Council is to deliver to Clinton a national petition in support of
PNTR signed by more than 140 state and local elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and the two top House Democratic leaders are
fighting the legislation, suggesting it will hurt U.S. jobs. The
Clinton administration, Republican leaders and U.S. business groups
have been lobbying lawmakers for weeks to get the legislation
passed.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves the measure in a vote expected later this
month, Senate passage is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidents said granting China permanent trade
benefits would build upon market-opening initiatives pursued by
every American president since World War II. ''It will open China's
markets to us without increasing China's access to our market,''
the presidents said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who soon begins his fourth term as Fed chairman, said
China's membership in the WTO would promote economic development in
China and help lift the country's poor out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 5 letter to House Banking Committee Chairman Rep. James
Leach, R-Iowa, Greenspan also said permanent trade relations would
ease political liberties inside the nation of 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   ''History has demonstrated that implicit in any removal of power
from central planners and broadening of market mechanisms as would
occur under WTO is a more general spread of rights to
individuals,'' Greenspan wrote. ''Such a development will be a far
stronger vehicle to foster other individual rights than any other
alternative of which I am aware.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Democratic Whip Daniel Bonoir of Michigan,
a leading opponent of extending permanent most favored nation
status to China, said opinion polls show three-quarters of
Americans oppose the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bonoir and about a dozen members of his working
group against the legislation, will hear from actress Goldie Hawn,
who will express her concerns about China's human rights offenses
in the ongoing debate over trade, Bonoir's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidents disagree, saying a vote for PNTR will
soften U.S.-China relations and make positive change within China
more likely by opening doors to the information revolution and
speeding up reforms that are dismantling many state controls over
the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vote against PNTR will make it far more difficult to attain
these critical goals,'' the presidents wrote in their open letter.
''It would be read in China as a vote for confrontation and as an
argument for hunkering down, instead of continuing to reach out.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Development Bank Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK McDOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) -- The Asian Development Bank has
become the latest victim of protests and new scrutiny that has
dogged the big multilateral economic institutions since the World
Trade Organization's debacle in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the bank concluded a three-day annual meeting in a
luxury hotel that resembled an armed camp, ringed by an estimated
2,000 riot police to keep out about 1,200 mostly poor Thais
protesting that bank-funded projects like dams have ruined their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has a 13 percent stake in the bank,
signaled during the meeting that it is not prepared to put up more
money in a new capital increase, saying the bank should make better
use of the funds it has.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal put Washington and similarly minded European members
of the board of governors on a collision course with Japan, which
also has a 13 percent stake and dominates the bank's management.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has urged the bank to be more selective in the loans
it makes to developing countries and not compete with lending
better made by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were papered over in end-of-conference notes
issued by Tadao Chino, the bank's Japanese president, saying that
governors had agreed to go ahead with a study of the bank's
resources and needs, while also agreeing the institution needed to
be more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's mission is to reduce poverty in Asia, where it says
some 900 million people live on less than one dollar a day. Critics
charge it with being more comfortable with doing deals with
governments and big business than consulting with the people it
intends to help.
</P>
<P>
   The same criticism has been leveled the past six months against
the WTO, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank -- the
international economic institutions on which the ADB is modeled.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin M. Truman, the U.S. Treasury's assistant secretary for
international affairs, told the board Sunday that ''we must find
concrete ways to strengthen popular participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was driven home by daily protests outside the
delegates' hotel. Fire trucks with water cannon were parked next to
Mercedes-Benz cars and tour buses ferrying the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators came from a coastal area south of the
capital, Bangkok, where the ADB is helping fund a mammoth
wastewater treatment plant to clean up pollution from barely
regulated industries that sprouted over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers, who make their living mostly from fishing and
farming, see the location of the facility as punishment for a mess
they didn't make.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters demanded that the ADB stop funding the project
and, echoing anti-globalization demonstrations, cease making loans
that increase the indebtedness of poor countries or harm farmers
and the poor in the name of financial restructuring and reform.
</P>
<P>
   The ADB claims that millions of people will benefit from the
treatment plant but has admitted its consultations with the
villagers were poor.
</P>
<P>
   Chino sent them a letter Sunday, promising the bank would study
their demands and meet their leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said they wanted a better answer Monday, before
the bank delegates went home. On Monday, when they got the same
letter, they burned it, lit firecrackers and dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Weeraporn Sopa, 33, leader of a farmers' confederation from
Thailand's poor northeast, said the demonstration built on the
protests he attended in Seattle in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to warn the ADB and organizations like it they should
listen to us,'' Weeraporn said. ''When you still have a conscience,
you can control the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the unrest that derailed the WTO meeting, the United
States has shifted next year's ADB gathering from its original
venue -- Seattle -- to Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformer Warns of Vote Chaos  </HEADLINE>
By HASSAN SARBAKHSHIAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A pro-reform candidate warned Monday that
annulling parliamentary vote results in Iran's capital -- where
reformists won an overwhelming majority -- could lead to chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers fear hard-liners in the Islamic clerical government
aim to overturn election victories of pro-reform candidates,
particularly after the Guardian Council, which oversees elections
and is controlled by the conservatives, claimed large discrepancies
in voting in Tehran. Reformers won 29 of Tehran's 30 seats in the
Feb. 18 voting for the Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''An annulment would lead to political chaos,'' Mohsen Armin,
one of the top winners in Tehran, warned in a speech at Tehran
University on Monday. ''Any talk of annulling the results for
Tehran is a joke, because the consequences of doing that would be
so great that no group or faction can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments from members of the Guardian Council about the Tehran
results have been contradictory, with some leading members saying
annulments are possible and others considering them unlikely. On
Monday, a top official on the council was quoted as saying he did
not expect annulments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the result of the vote recounting, I do not expect the
(Tehran) result to be nullified,'' Ayatollah Gholam-Reza Rezvani,
head of the central supervisory board for monitoring elections, was
quoted as saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran was the top prize in a nationwide victory for reformers,
who won control of the legislature from conservatives for the first
time since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clergy to power
in Iran. Since the February voting, hard-liners have cracked down
in a bid to keep their power, closing 16 pro-democracy newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian Council has been an important weapon in the
hard-liners' power struggle against President Mohammad Khatami,
whose program of social and political reform they have been trying
to halt.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers were particularly concerned about results in Tehran
being overturned since it was there that their most important
figures were elected. A parliament without them would be virtually
toothless.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists won about 120 seats on Feb. 18 and between 47 and
52 more in run-off elections Friday. The hard-liners control no
more than 70 spots in the 290-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The council has already annulled 12 reformist victories outside
Tehran and given two of those seats to hard-liners. Some hard-line
officials have called for the whole Tehran slate to be scratched.
</P>
<P>
   The council ordered a recount in Tehran upon the request of
losing candidates. It said Sunday it had found unspecified
discrepancies of more than 10 percent in 88 percent of the boxes
counted so far.
</P>
<P>
   But the Interior Ministry, which is controlled by Khatami allies
and which supervised the elections alongside the council, disputed
the council's claim. ''The most important claim of the recent
Guardian Council statement, which said 88 percent of the boxes had
differences of more than 10 percent, is denied,'' the ministry said
in a statement published in newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their election rout, the hard-liners control key
institutions like the judiciary, military and the broadcast
network. In a crackdown over the past two weeks, hard-line courts
have detained several prominent reformist leaders and activists and
closed down the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a new reformist newspaper owned by a top presidential
official began publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doubtless, publishing a newspaper in the current social
climate ... appears to be an act of insanity,'' the daily Bahar
said in its first editorial. The newspaper is owned by Saeed
Pourazizi, head of news and information in Khatami's office and one
of the president's close confidantes.
</P>
<P>
   The Culture Ministry, which grants publishing licenses, is
controlled by Khatami's allies.

<HEADLINE> Despite astronomical odds, lottery frenzy continues  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- How big is the Big Game jackpot?
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than the total prize money given away on ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' -- 19 times over. Enough cash to pay the entire
Minnesota Twins baseball team until 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot ballooned Monday to $325 million -- an astronomical
level almost inconceivable to anyone but superstar athletes and
dot-com tycoons. If it goes to just one person after Tuesday's
drawing, the prize will be the richest in world history.
</P>
<P>
   In seven states, gas stations and grocery stores were swamped
Monday with long lines of people hoping their numbers -- some
carefully chosen, others computer-picked -- would change their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're dreaming of what they'll do with it for that minute
they're buying it,'' said Kevin Finneran, owner of a Li'l Peach
convenience store in South Boston. ''People love talking about it
for that minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Game officials said they expect to sell more than 140
million tickets before the winning numbers are picked Tuesday at 11
p.m. EDT -- including a crush of sales near state lines, where
people drive hours to get in on the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If sales are going strong or are higher than anticipated, or
if the bond interest rates go higher -- that also helps us increase
the jackpot,'' said Virginia Haines, New Jersey Lottery executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's previous record lottery jackpot was $295.7 million,
set in the multistate Powerball game in 1998. That prize was shared
by 13 machinists from Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of ticket sales leading up to Friday's drawing
had increased the jackpot from $230 million to $250 million just in
the hours before that night's numbers were picked.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales from last Tuesday's drawing to Friday night exceeded
$122 million. New Jersey led with sales of nearly $34 million. The
game also is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Haines attributed record New Jersey sales to large volumes of
ticket buyers from New York and Pennsylvania, states that do not
participate in multistate games.
</P>
<P>
   At Circle Liquor Store in Somers Point, N.J., Big Game tickets
were selling faster than beer -- quite an accomplishment given the
90-degree heat and the store's location next to booze-free Ocean
City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Friday, we sold about 6,000 tickets,'' said Joseph Cox, who
was working the lottery machine. ''Normally, we sell about $500 on
the day of a drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. Monday, 1,400 tickets had been sold for Tuesday
night's drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Players were in good spirits, Cox said. Most weren't regular
players but couldn't resist the lure of the record jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, I don't like working the lottery. But it's been fun
this time. Half these people don't know what they're doing, but
they're having fun doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lena McKelvey, 21, of Doylestown, Pa., was one of them. She
bought two tickets Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I won, I'd go traveling, probably take a one-month cruise
to the Caribbean. And I'd buy my mother a nice BMW. And I'd take a
million and set up a shelter for the homeless,'' McKelvey said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 7-Eleven store in Northfield, N.J., co-owner Liz
Krakowski took up permanent residence on a stool next to the
store's lottery machine, punching numbers and listening to players
dreaming aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's so excited about it. And the groups are incredible
with their pools. They're buying 300 tickets at a time. Everyone's
saying how it's too much money, they don't know what they'd do if
they won. But no one's planning on going back to work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cana, Va., just across the North Carolina state line, 200
lottery players queued up at an Exxon station before sunrise. One
man bought $3,050 in tickets, and gasoline sales suffered all day
because the parking lot was full.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the sixth day in a row it's been that way,'' manager
Leo Bobbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   After taxes, one person who wins the jackpot would get either
$8.5 million a year for 26 years or a one-time payment of $110
million.
</P>
<P>
   The $325 million jackpot could grow Tuesday, when lottery
officials confer by telephone. It already tops the previous
American record, a $295.7 million Powerball payout split by 13
machinists in Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world's lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One. But that game spreads itself thin
-- thousands of prizes are awarded in a four-hour ceremony that
brings the country to a standstill as orphaned children sing out
the winning numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The odds in Tuesday's Big Game are exponentially stacked against
players. The chance that a $1 ticket will match all six numbers is
one in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those are roughly the same odds as putting a finger down
randomly on a list of everyone in America and landing on an
ex-president. Or of flipping a coin and seeing heads 26 consecutive
times.
</P>
<P>
   W. Scott Wood, who teaches a class on psychology and gambling at
Drake University in Iowa, explains the long odds to his students
this way: ''Try to imagine the equivalent of sticking a pin in the
Los Angeles white pages and hitting your cousin's name. Or throwing
a rock off the Empire State and hitting someone you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple University math professor John Allen Paulos said the game
amounts to a cheap dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''A man is hundreds of times more likely to suffer a heart
attack between the time he buys the ticket and the drawing than he
is to win the jackpot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the fever created by the record jackpot only increases the
chances that more than one person will pick correctly.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the frenzy Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, so many people tried to access the lottery's Web
site that the server crashed.
</P>
<P>
   And in western Maryland, the line outside Grantsville Liquors
was half a city block long. Inside, Bernadette Fedornak waited in
line for an hour and a half after driving from Pittsburgh to buy

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Expand Land Conservation  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To critics it's a pork-barrel land grab, but
to others an environmental landmark. It's a massive conservation
bill that calls for spending nearly $45 billion over 15 years to
buy public lands to create new urban parks, protect wildlife and
restore eroded beaches, and the House is expected to approve it
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bill's endorsement by 314 of the 435 House members,
it has infuriated some Republican conservatives, mainly from the
intermountain West, particularly since it's being championed by a
staunch ally in the property rights debate -- Resources Committee
Chairman Don Young, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who was instrumental in crafting the Conservation and
Reinvestment Act, calls the property rights advocates' concerns
''utterly ridiculous'' and maintains the bill specifically protects
landowners from having to give up their property.
</P>
<P>
   Even the critics acknowledge House approval is virtually assured
as lawmakers find it hard to oppose a bill that will funnel
billions of federal dollars to their states while letting them show
support for the environment during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration -- which announced its own, more
modest $1.4 billion ''land legacy'' initiative last year -- supports
the bill. Shortly before Earth Day last month, President Clinton
met with the measure's Democratic and GOP sponsors and urged that
the bill be passed this year, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's prospects in the Senate, where one or two senators
can stall legislation, remains unclear. The legislation is to get
its first Senate test next month in a committee vote. Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, whose Energy and Natural Resources Committee
will consider the measure he is co-sponsoring, said, ''We still
have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators involved in budget and appropriations matters are
worried about the bill's cost, and a group of western senators --
from states where the federal government already owns huge amounts
of land -- fear a new federal assault on private property, Murkowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, called it on Monday ''a
blank check'' to take private lands. ''If this bill passes it will
become the death knell to the Republican majority. Our grass roots
will become discouraged (over) ... the impact it will have on
private ownership,'' she said at a news conference hosted by the
conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have criticized the legislation as a threat to
property rights include Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Republican
Reps. Barbara Cubin of Wyoming, Mike Simpson of Idaho, John
Doolittle and George Radanovich of California and Bob Schaffer of
Colorado -- all members of Young's committee.
</P>
<P>
   The money -- about a third of which would go for coastal
environmental remediating -- comes from the $4 billion to $5 billion
collected annually from oil drilling on government leases, mostly
offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's projected annual spending programs include:
</P>
<P>
   --$1 billion for coastal ecosystems, restoring wetlands and
eroded beaches and repairing damage caused by offshore oil
drilling. Distribution is pegged to miles of coastline and amount
of oil production.
</P>
<P>
   --$900 million for conservation-related federal and state land
purchases, three times what is spent on such purchases today, and
$125 million in matching grants for urban parks and recreational
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   --$350 million for wildlife conservation and hunting programs.
</P>
<P>
   --$150 million for conservation easements and landowner
incentives to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   --$100 million to protect historic sites and $200 million for
Indian lands restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The money could be use for a myriad of programs from restoring
coastal wetlands and buying islands of private land within national
parks to building soccer fields and baseball parks in suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes a permanent commitment,'' said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif, who crafted the bill with Young. ''The people who run the
parks, who enjoy our trails and open spaces, who support recreation
and wildlife tell me they desperately need this bill or
irreplaceable resources are going to be lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Young: ''The legislation will guide our nation's
conservation, recreation and wildlife program for decades to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   That Young and Miller, the top Democrat on Young's committee,
would so vigorously agree on any environmental legislation has
astounded longtime observers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Young, often an outspoken foe of environmentalists, and Miller,
a favorite of the green groups, have clashed repeatedly on
environmental issues from oil drilling in an arctic refuge to
protection of California desert lands and Alaska's Tongass forest.
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind their joint effort for this bill is simple,
says Rindy O'Brien of the Wilderness Society, who has watched the
congressional debate on the measure: Young wants to leave a legacy
and, perhaps more important, ''This is legislation that would give
Alaska a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Current distribution plans would make coastal states with
offshore oil drilling the biggest winners: Alaska, $163 million;
California, $324 million; Louisiana, $311 million; Texas, $236
million; Alaska, $163 million; Florida, $141 million. But every
state would get some money, even land-bound Vermont, $8.9 million,
and Kansas, $13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   With a little for everyone, the legislation has attracted wide
support from groups that rarely work together on anything, from
environmental groups such as the Izak Walton League, Wilderness
Society and National Wildlife Federation to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and most
governors and mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest opposition comes from property rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will be literally kicked off their land,'' said Mike
Hardiman of the American Land Rights Association, who fears his 5
acres of land -- so-called inholdings -- surrounding by federal land
in the California desert could be in jeopardy. ''They're targeting
us. We're in their cross hairs.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cuba Seeks US Immigration Rule End  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba announced a campaign Monday to end U.S.
immigration policies it says encourage citizens to undertake the
same type of dangerous sea journeys that killed the mother of Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every grave incident of a boatwreck, kidnapping or death will
be known by our people and by world public opinion as irrefutable
proof of the cynicism of the policies of the United States against
Cuba,'' the Communist Party daily Granma said in a front page
story.
</P>
<P>
   During the 5{-month battle to repatriate the 6-year-old Cuban
child to his homeland, Fidel Castro has repeatedly lashed out at a
1966 U.S. law that allows Cubans who reach American soil to avoid
deportation, characterizing it as a ''killing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears that Castro's long-standing fight against the
Cuban Adjustment Act will not only be expanded, but is likely to
continue long after the Elian custody case is resolved. The
newspaper promised an ''energetic fight against the violations of
the sacred right to life of our citizens,'' using state television,
radio and youths to get out the message.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes three days after 14 severely dehydrated
and sunburned Cubans were found floating off Miami's coast in an
aluminum boat. They had been at sea for 10 days and had to share a
small bag of crackers and drink salt water and their own urine to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Cuban officials published a small note in the
Juventud Rebelde daily referring to the trip as ''another crime of
the murderous law.''
</P>
<P>
   Passed at the height of the Cold War, the U.S. law allows any
Cuban who reaches American soil to apply for permanent residency
after being in the United States for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Elian fell under this law because after he was rescued at sea in
late November, he was brought to a hospital in the United States.
If he had come from almost any other country, Elian would have been
deported right away. Instead he was released into temporary custody
of relatives living in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 Cubans rescued at sea Friday also were covered by the law
because they, too, were admitted into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and other senior officials complain that the U.S. law
violates 1994 and 1995 migration accords between the two countries,
designed to prevent a repeat of the so-called ''rafters crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Cuban government said it would no longer stop people
from leaving the island, more than 30,000 rafters set out across
the straits, with hundreds of people leaving daily in the summer of
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under the migration agreements, the U.S. Coast Guard is charged
with repatriating the majority of would-be Cuban immigrants
intercepted at sea -- even a short distance from land.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is also obliged to help encourage legal
migration to the United States by providing a minimum of 20,000
visas to Cubans every year.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials, meanwhile, are charged with trying to prevent
the illegal departure of Cubans for the United States. They
vigorously deny sporadic rumors that pop up in Miami's Cuban exile
community that Castro is planning another mass exodus.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Baseball Player Still Missing  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Cuban college baseball player who abruptly left
his teammates shortly after arriving in the United States surfaced
in Miami and intends to defect, a sports agent said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Miguel Chaoui was last seen getting into a waiting car at
the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport Saturday afternoon, shortly after
the team arrived to play the University of St. Thomas team in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cubas, a sports agent who has helped other Cuban ballplayers
after they fled their communist country, said Monday that Chaoui
would apply for asylum and wants to play baseball professionally in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He basically jumped in the car of a family member Saturday
night and arrived in Miami yesterday,'' Cubas said, adding Chaoui
was staying with relatives in South Florida. Cubas plans to
represent Chaoui.
</P>
<P>
   The mood Sunday was sedate among members of Equipo Caribe, or
Team Caribbean, which is made up mostly of students from the
University of Havana and some students from a technical institute
in the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to the states to have a sports exchange and academics
exchange, not to have a migration exchange,'' team captain Osmar
Ernesto Fernandez said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know why he has made this decision,'' said Fernandez,
26, who has known Chaoui since boyhood. ''In Cuba, we have
everything we need.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will play St. Thomas at the Metrodome in Minneapolis on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first reaction was rage. We were a little bit upset,''
Fernandez said of Chaoui's apparent defection.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Dease, the president of St. Thomas, said school
officials made sure none of the St. Thomas players was harboring
Chaoui. He said that the players were all surprised to learn of his
disappearance and that several St. Thomas players had been
corresponding with him since their trip to Cuba in January.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Cuban team of college players came to the United
States was in 1987 when a national team played several games at the
Metrodome.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Endorses Million Mom March  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he is frustrated and saddened by
Congress' refusal to pass tougher gun laws, President Clinton on
Monday heartily endorsed the Million Mom March that is expected to
draw tens of thousands of women to the capital in support of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what they're doing is a very noble and good thing,''
the president said after meeting with organizers of the
demonstration scheduled for, Mothers' Day.
</P>
<P>
   With tears in his eyes, Clinton said he was moved by the stories
of parents whose children were killed in gun incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am subdued. I'm frustrated. I'm very sad because I don't
want any more kids to die,'' the president told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo called on presumptive
Republican presidential nominee George Bush to clarify whether he
would pursue new laws to protect gun makers from liability lawsuits
if he became president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will he immunize these gun manufacturers or will he demand
they act responsibly,'' Cuomo asked during a telephone press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who has campaigned for Bush likely opponent Vice
President Al Gore, said Bush has been less than clear in answering
whether he would protect the gun industry from 31 suits filed by
cities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March is expected to draw 100,000 people to the
National Mall in Washington. Other demonstrations are scheduled in
20 cities nationwide, including Tulsa, Okla., Los Angeles, Denver,
Atlanta and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The group is pressing Congress for stricter gun control,
including measures to require all handgun owners to be licensed and
registered, require built-in child safety locks and limit handgun
purchases to one a month.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees Thomases, founder of the march, said Clinton urged
them to consider their efforts ''the beginning of a real grassroots
movement in this country'' on tightening gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the president told us today is, 'Please don't end with
Mother's Day and do not give up. This is not going to be an easy
battle,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said organizers wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman
Orrin Hatch nine months ago requesting action on gun legislation.
''Perhaps we'll have another discussion after the march,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they're doing is profoundly important,'' Clinton said.
''And we in the administration want to do whatever we can to
support them. They are taking a stand for their children. Many of
them have lost loved ones, they've lost children, they've lost
spouses. And there will be many more just like them who are here.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want Congress to act on the common-sense gun legislation
before it,'' he said. ''And of course they want Congress to go
beyond that to licensing, to registration.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ''it is unconscionable'' that Congress has not acted in
the year since the massacre of students at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the gun control advocates ''will succeed over the
long run if they stay with it, because they represent the heavy
majority of the American people, and they have borne the heavy
burden in their own lives, which they have been willing to put into
this effort, and I'm very grateful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 2.5 million-member National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union, bought a
full-page ad in Tuesday's Washington Post urging immediate passage
of tougher guns laws. ''No more stalling. No more excuses,'' the ad
said. ''No more loopholes. No poison pill amendments.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Biggest Corporate Flight User  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott flies
frequently on aircraft belonging to various private companies with
issues before Congress, writing checks totaling $101,029 for
corporate flights since Jan. 1, 1995, more than any other senator
up for re-election this fall, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
   In second place was Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., whose campaign
spent $18,730 on corporate flights, according to the Campaign Study
Group, a non-partisan consulting firm that analyzes campaign
spending. Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., was third with $17,757.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators take advantage of a practice in which they use
corporate jets and then reimburse the companies for the price of a
first-class flight, far below the going rate for chartering a
private jet. The money comes from the senators' campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has advantages for both: Lawmakers do not have to
worry about airline schedules or making connections; companies
providing the planes often have a lobbyist aboard to schmooze a
virtually captive one-person audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Private corporate jet travel is still one of the biggest scams
in Washington,'' Charles Lewis, director of the watchdog Center for
Public Integrity, said Monday. ''The average American cannot afford
to travel on a private jet and the face time it affords lobbyists
with lawmakers is absolutely invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are being subsidized by the interests who have business
before them. It's no more complicated than that,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's campaign committee reimbursed U.S. Tobacco Co. $18,196
for flights, R.J. Reynolds $2,876 and Philip Morris $2,107. Lott
has opposed Clinton administration efforts to regulate tobacco as a
drug and raise federal cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also paid Schering-Plough $1,924 for the use of its
corporate jet. The company is pushing legislation that would allow
a two-year extension of its patent for the anti-allergy drug
Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also flew aboard planes owned by telecommunications
companies BellSouth and MCI Worldcom. The companies are on opposite
sides of legislation to allow local Bell operating companies to
send data over long-distance phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is fully disclosed, privately funded and totally legal
travel for a leader whose job demands he be on the road quite a
bit,'' Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said. ''We are complying with
the law and sparing the taxpayers the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy reimbursed the law firm of Ness Motley Loadholt
Richardson &AMP; Poole $4,856 for flights. The firm opposes efforts in
Congress to impose restrictions on liability lawsuits. Kennedy also
paid $3,311 to Raytheon, a defense contractor, and $2,149 to the
American Family Life Assurance Company, which has lobbied hard
against restrictions on selling cancer insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers as well as incumbents flew the corporate skies.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, seeking a Senate seat from
New York, reimbursed FHC Health Systems $9,175 for flights. FHC,
based in Norfolk, Va., is the nation's second-largest mental health
managed care firm. Her expected Republican opponent, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, flew on a plane owned by Canandaigua
Brands, an upstate New York winery. He paid $486.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Tobacco was reimbursed the most over the five-year period,
$31,293. Besides Lott, other senators who flew in the company's
planes included Conrad Burns, R-Mont.; John Ashcroft, R-Mo.; Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz.; and Spence Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In second place was Federal Express, which supplied planes to
Lott, Kennedy and Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. The company was
reimbursed $15,253.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do it when senators or congressmen request a plane,''
company spokesman Jess Bunn said.

<HEADLINE> Cable Execs Want TV Rules Changed  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Still stinging from last week's highly
publicized spat between ABC and Time Warner, cable executives who
gathered for their annual convention said Monday the laws governing
their transmission deals with broadcasters need to be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law should never have permitted this,'' Time Warner chief
Gerald Levin said of the showdown that left 3.5 millions of his
customers without a local ABC signal for a day and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The system is ''just bad public policy and we aim to change
it,'' he said, drawing applause at the National Cable Television
Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, ABC service was cut off for Time Warner customers in
seven cities after the two companies failed to reach agreement on a
transmission deal. The media giants were sparring over how much
money Time Warner must compensate The Walt Disney Co., ABC's
corporate parent, for the right to carry some of its cable
channels. Disney says that the price it is asking for its cable
channels is fair since Time Warner gets ABC for free.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and Time Warner agreed to extend their negotiations until
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are guaranteed the right to have their signals
carried on local cable systems for free. But the 1992 Cable Act
also gave broadcasters the option instead to hammer out private
retransmission agreements with cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, the two sides must strike a deal before
cable operators can carry local channels. Broadcasting companies
have used this arrangement to seek compensation like having new
basic cable networks also carried on cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   But cable operators say this provision of the law has given the
broadcasters too much leverage in negotiations and puts them in an
untenable position as they try to hold down cable rates for their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our friends in the broadcast industry however do not seem to
understand this simple fact: cable consumers are unwilling to foot
the bill for whatever price a broadcaster demands for the carriage
of a signal that is distributed for free over the air,'' said
Robert Sachs, NCTA's president.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had no immediate comment, but the broadcasting industry
lobby said it found ''amusing'' the cable industry's sudden
expression of concern for consumers. ''Where was their compassion
last week when they yanked ABC off the air for millions of
viewers?'' said Dennis Wharton of the National Association of
Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would have to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal situation would be for the marketplace to work these
issues out and for the companies to ''negotiate their deals
seamlessly,'' said Deborah Lathen, chief of the cable services
bureau at the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the bureau determined that Time Warner had violated
the law by dropping ABC signals during the period known as
''sweeps'' and pledged proper enforcement action would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups have used the snafu to further their
position that Time Warner's proposed merger with America Online
would give it too much power in the online world -- allowing it to
block out rival Internet providers trying to get onto the company's
high-speed pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Levin reasserted that the giant marriage between the two
businesses would not squelch out other companies and that it would
also make its programming available to all providers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no gatekeeper in this new media age,'' Levin said.
''Content diversity is the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators so far have been unwilling to regulate Internet
service carried over high-speed cable lines and ''I don't think
there is a need at this point to talk about regulation,'' Daley
said.

<HEADLINE> Weather, maintenance prompt call to conserve power  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Utility officials on Monday declared a
power watch as an early bout of summer-like weather drove up demand
for air conditioners and fans throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures topped 80 in most of Connecticut for the third
straight day. In Hartford, the mercury soared to 91, breaking the
date's previous high of 90 set in 1936, the National Weather
Service in Taunton, Mass., reported.
</P>
<P>
   Danbury reached 86 Monday and Bridgeport hit 85.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is coupled with humidity being pulled out of the Gulf
of Mexico and over the Midwest, NWS meteorologist Mike Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Around here, if the wind is coming out of the west, it's
coming off land and that produces a considerable amount of heat,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the warm weather, several power plants were out of
service Monday for annual maintenance, according to ISO New
England, the operator of the region's electricity generating
stations. The loss of those plants strained resources when demand
unexpectedly increased so early in the year, spokeswoman Ellen
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The generation that's out of service right now will be going
full-tilt this summer, when we usually have this kind of weather,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The power watch, the first of the year, was lifted at 4:30 p.m.
after about four hours. The advisory is the least serious issued by
ISO.
</P>
<P>
   Customers on Monday were being asked to consider shutting off
lights and electrical appliances. Business were requested to help
by unplugging office equipment such as computers.
</P>
<P>
   ISO New England has said they will be ready to handle the
summer's peak demand, expected to top last year's record usage of
22,544 watts on July 6. Officials said several new power plants
would be operational and the region's nuclear plants looked ready
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut will be in better shape because Millstone 2 and 3 --
down all last summer -- are expected to be online this year.
</P>
<P>
   The region's power supply was repeatedly strained during last
summer's a record-breaking heat wave and drought.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the heat is not expected to break until at least
Wednesday night, when a cold front over the Midwest carries in
cooler air.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo-SmithKline Merger Gets OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission Monday approved
the merger between British pharmaceutical companies Glaxo Wellcome
PLC and SmithKline Beecham PLC, which will make it the world's
largest pharmaceuticals firm.
</P>
<P>
   The EU made the merger conditional upon the merged company
selling certain drugs. They are: SmithKline's Kytril, for the
treatment of nausea associated with chemotherapy, SmithKline's
Famvir, a herpes drug, and either SmithKline's Vectavir cream or
Glaxo's Zovirax, both of which treat cold sores.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the merged company could be required to sell its asthma
drug Ariflo if its European rivals don't get approval to market a
new asthma drug.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still faces approval by U.S. regulators, though the
companies said they expect it by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo agreed to buy SmithKline last January in a deal now valued
at $76.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called Glaxo SmithKline, will have 7.3
percent of global sales in its sector, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> May Department Stores Earnings Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- May Department Stores Co.'s first-quarter
earnings dropped 1.7 percent from a year ago, as cooler-than-normal
weather in April depressed sales of spring clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis-based company said Monday that it earned $120
million, or 35 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 29,
compared with earnings of $122 million, or 34 cents per share, in
the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A share buyback helped boost the company's earnings per share,
but not enough to top Wall Street analysts' expectations of 36
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   May's stock still rose on Monday, climbing 37{ cents to $28.75
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were $3.04 billion, up 3.5 percent from $2.94 billion a
year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry
gauge of success, were flat with the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Like many retailers -- especially those with a big focus on
clothes, May's business was hurt by dreary, wet weather through
most of April. That dampened demand for everything from shorts to
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   May also announced three executive promotions on Monday: Thomas
D. Fingleton to executive vice president for finance and
operations; Kenneth L. Wilkerson to chairman of Hecht's; and Mark
J. Weikel to chairman of Foley's.
</P>
<P>
   May operates 422 stores in 36 states and the District of
Columbia. Year-to-date, the retailer has opened 14 new stores and
plans to open nine additional new stores in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Its stores include Lord &AMP; Taylor, Hecht's, Strawbridge's,
Foley's, Robinson-May, Filene's, Kaufmann's, Famous-Barr, L.S.
Ayres, The Jones Store, Meier &AMP; Frank and ZCMI.

<HEADLINE> Euro Down Against Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slid against the dollar once again
Monday as traders expected little action from European financial
officials to support the currency.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 89.70 cents,
down slightly from 89.79 cents late Friday. Despite the decline,
the euro was a full cent above the record low of 88.45 cents it
reached on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Currency markets have been looking ahead to a Thursday meeting
of European Central Bank officials and other European financial
officials, but indications so far have been that no firm action to
support the flagging euro is likely to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has been drifting lower in recent weeks as the U.S.
economy continues to show strong staying power.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Monday, the dollar was quoted at 109.03
Japanese yen, up from 108.34. The dollar also was quoted at 1.7276
Swiss francs, down from 1.7307, and 1.4917 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.4913.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1803 German
marks, up from 2.1790; 7.3124 French francs, up from 7.3079; and
2,158.49 Italian lire, up from 2,174.49.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound rose to $1.5321 from $1.5274.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopeful on Chernobyl Cover  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Monday construction of a permanent cover over the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant will be a ''welcome gift for the people of Ukraine and
a great environmental victory for all of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright commmented after a meeting with Ukraine Prime Minister
Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko. She said Yushchenko reaffirmed
the promise of President Leonid Kuchma to close the last Chernobyl
reactor by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Albright at a news conference was Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer of Germany, where a pledging conference will be
held in July to raise funds for the construction of a new cover for
the Chernobyl plant.
</P>
<P>
   A cover, or sarcophagus, that was built not long after the 1986
nuclear disaster is considered unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Some $360 million in addition to $400 million already raised is
needed for the new cover.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who attended Albright's meeting
with Yushchenko said he believes the donor countries will come up
with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine is concerned about alternate energy supplies once
Chernobyl is shut down completely. The senior official, asking not
to be identified, said two new nuclear reactors being contemplated
would cost about $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl disaster caused an estimated 4,000 deaths among
those who took part in the cleanup, and 70,000 people were disabled
by radiation, according to Ukrainian government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 3.4 million of Ukraine's 50 million people,
including some 1.26 million children, are considered affected by
Chernobyl, and many may not show the affects for years.
</P>
<P>
   Yushchenko also plans to President Clinton, National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summer during
his stay here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expects to visit Ukraine on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   About $225 million in U.S. assistance goes to Ukraine each year,
making it one of the highest recipients of U.S. aid dollars.
Geography and size make it one of the most important of the former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   A sore point in the relationship, the senior official said, is
the presence of factories that turn out pirated compact discs,
including many by American artists.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to work with the Ukrainians to end the
production, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Launches Titan Rocket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force on Monday launched a
critically needed defense warning satellite after three consecutive
failures of the troubled Titan 4 rocket at Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's got to be the most beautiful sight I've seen in 16 years
in this business,'' said Maj. Todd Ganger, deputy chief for missile
warnings at the U.S. Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force
Base, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing were
harshly criticized by Congress after $3 billion in rocket losses,
including a Milstar military communications satellite, a spy
satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office and a previous
Defense Support Program satellite.
</P>
<P>
   If all continues to go well, the $250 million DSP satellite the
rocket is carrying will enter orbit and become operational in about
30 days. The satellite is lined with more than 6,000 small infrared
sensors used to provide beyond-the-horizon detection of missile
launches and nuclear detonations.
</P>
<P>
   The 2{-ton satellite is the 20th in the system series, with
three more scheduled annually until a new system is introduced in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th DSP satellite was stranded in a useless orbit after a
Titan 4 launch April 9, 1999. Other failures of Titan 4 rockets
occurred April 30, 1999, and Aug. 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Titan 4 rocket was successfully launched on May 22, 1999, from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   Titan 4s are two-stage, liquid-fuel rockets with two solid-fuel
rocket motors.
</P>
<P>
   The first DSP satellite was launched in November 1970, and the
last was successfully deployed in February 1997. The current model
DSP satellites have a design life of five years, but many last
longer, according to the Air Force.

<HEADLINE> 'Sweeney Todd' at NY Philharmonic  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Voices from opera and Broadway mingled
seamlessly in the New York Philharmonic's new concert version of
''Sweeney Todd,'' a show that is still strong with a score that is
superlative.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic recorded the concerts on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights, and will issue a CD on its Special Editions label.
Andrew Litton, music director of the Dallas Symphony, conducted.
</P>
<P>
   George Hearn sang the lead in Stephen Sondheim's musical about a
19th century ''demon barber'' with deep emotion, conveying regret,
sadness and love for his long-lost wife and baby. Hearn, who had
followed the original 1979 lead, Len Cariou, on Broadway and sang
the part on television, was filling in for Metropolitan Opera
bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, who is recovering from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, Hearn dipped back and forth between sanity and madness,
turning into a vengeful monster who slices throats instead of
giving shaves.
</P>
<P>
   Patti LuPone, in her first Sondheim show, was sprightly and
optimistic -- with a voice that can belt -- as the practical Mrs.
Lovett, who has the bright idea to use the corpses in the meat pies
she sells.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Plishka of the Met sang Judge Turpin, who sent Todd to
Australia as a convict and made Todd's daughter, Johanna, his ward.
Heidi Grant Murphy of the Met sang Johanna while Davis Gaines of
''The Phantom of the Opera'' played the young sailor who loves her,
and there was no clash of styles in their duets.
</P>
<P>
   Other classical singers included John Aler and Stanford Olsen as
the judge's pal, the Beadle, and another barber.
</P>
<P>
   Audra McDonald, who has three Tony awards for Broadway roles,
sang an old beggar and Neil Patrick Harris, from the TV series
''Doogie Howser'' and Broadway's ''Rent,'' sang Tobias, the boy who
offers to protect Mrs. Lovett with the song ''Not While I'm
Around.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Philharmonic presented a concert version of Sondheim's
''Follies'' in 1985, the cast stood in front of the orchestra to
sing the songs. ''Sweeney Todd'' has been upgraded to semi-staged.
The New York Choral Artists stood on risers across the back of the
Avery Fisher Hall stage, but could walk quickly down each side wall
to the front.
</P>
<P>
   The principals used the front of the stage, as when Mrs. Lovett
played an imaginary harmonium, and, on a raised stage in the middle
of the orchestra, Todd cut his victims' throats. A red light hit
them at the moment of murder, but there was no blood or chute for
the body. Still, a viewer felt a frisson of horror.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in Columbine Case  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Monday to helping Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold get one of the guns they used in the
Columbine High School Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Joseph Duran, 23, pleaded guilty to two of three felony
charges against him and faces up to nine years in prison at his
sentencing, scheduled for June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Steve Jensen said in reaching a plea agreement with
Duran, he dismissed a charge of contributing to the delinquency of
a minor. He declined to discuss what kind of sentence he would
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Duran worked in a pizza shop with Klebold and Harris and
introduced them to gun seller Mark Manes at a gun show three months
before the April 20, 1999, attack. Manes pleaded guilty and
received a six-year prison term in November for providing a TEC-DC9
handgun to Klebold and Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Duran pleaded guilty to providing a handgun to a juvenile -- the
TEC-DC9 the gunmen obtained from Manes -- and illegally possessing a
sawed-off shotgun during target practice with Klebold and Harris.
The two students later killed 12 students and a teacher before
turning their guns on themselves at their high school.
</P>
<P>
   Legal analyst Scott Robinson said he was surprised Duran
accepted a plea agreement, which he said could result in a sentence
of 18 years in prison if the judge finds aggravating circumstances.

   'Love Bug' Virus Suspect Arrested

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A bank employee in the Philippines is
under arrest on suspicion of links to the ''ILOVEYOU' computer
virus that overwhelmed networks around the world. His girlfiend is
also under suspicion. But relatives of the man, Reomel Ramones,
said they believe the real culprit may be a third person who lived
in the couple's apartment -- the girlfriend's unemployed sister, who
recently graduated from a computer school that a U.S. security firm
has been tied to the ''Love Bug'' virus. Investigators raided the
suspects' apartment in Pandacan, a lower-middle-class Manila
neighborhood, and seized computer diskettes, wires, telephones and
other computer accessories, officials said.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is reported to be exploring a
number of possible alternatives to the government's plan for a
company breakup. The company is due to submit its response to the
government on Wednesday. Spokesman Mark Murray said today it is too
soon to talk publicly about what Microsoft will do. But media
reports suggest it will raise the possibility of allowing computer
makers more flexibility in installing and altering the Windows
operating system. Another possibility is that Microsoft also might
suggest offering a version of Windows without the Internet Explorer
Web browser tied to it. The linkage was one of the first charges
leveled at the company by the U.S. Justice Department and 19 state
attorneys general.

   Treasury Urges Low-Cost Banking
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing a $30
million plan to help millions of low-income people open low-cost,
basic bank accounts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
today. An estimated 10 percent of U.S. households, or some 10
million families, do not have bank accounts. They are predominantly
poor and minority and often elderly or disabled, according to
government officials. The so-called ''First Accounts'' plan will be
proposed to Congress this week, Summers told the Consumer Bankers
Association that the plan would provide subsidies such as tax
incentives to banks, thrifts and credit unions to offer low-cost,
''no frills'' checking accounts for lower-income people.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Still stinging from last week's highly

gathered for their annual convention said today the laws governing
their transmission deals with broadcasters need to be re-examined.
Time Warner chief Gerald Levin said the law never should have
permitted the showdown that left 3.5 millions of his customers
without a local ABC signal for a day and a half. A week ago, ABC
service was cut off for Time Warner customers in seven cities after
the two companies failed to reach agreement on a transmission deal.
Service resumed when they agreed to extend negotiations until

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Geon Co. and M.A. Hanna Co. are merging in a
$570 million deal that company officials say will form the world's
largest polymer services company. The combination links Geon's
manufacturing strengths with Hanna's experience in making and
distributing polymer products, which can be plastics, rubber,
resins and industrial film. Geon's specialty is vinyl plastics.
When combined, the companies expect to benefit from raw materials
savings, market-related opportunities and overhead reductions by
2002.

</P>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission today approved
the merger between British pharmaceutical companies Glaxo Wellcome
PLC and SmithKline Beecham PLC, which will make it the world's
largest pharmaceuticals firm. The EU's executive office made the
approval conditional upon the companies' agreeing to either sell
off certain drug licensing agreements or voluntarily license some
drug trademark rights to competitors within the European market.

   European Stocks Close Lower
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed lower today on low volume
as fears over the telecommunications sector hit bourses while
losses on the Nasdaq Composite weighed on technology stocks.
Telecom names fell across Europe from the beginning of trade as the
breakdown of merger talks between KPN of the Netherlands and
Spain's Telefonica sapped investor confidence in a sector already
hurt by the high prices of mobile phone licenses. The Dow Jones
Euro Stoxx Index was down 4.2 points at 441.3. London's FTSE-100
Share Index fell 0.4 percent to 6,216.3; Frankfurt's Xetra DAX
Index fell 1.6 percent to 7,408.09; Paris' CAC-40 Index was down
0.5 percent to 6,514.42.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Honors Fallen Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With a wail of sirens, Israel slowed its usual
frenetic activity Monday and began a solemn, nationwide tribute to
nearly 20,000 soldiers killed in the nation's wars and terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a uniquely Israeli contrast, Memorial Day is followed
immediately by raucous Independence Day celebrations, underlining
the link the people see between the wars and their nation's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nov. 29, 1947, when the United Nations approved the
creation of the state of Israel, 19,109 people have been killed in
military service or in hostile acts, according to the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In a close-knit country of 6 million people, that translates
into a personal sense of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses close early for the ceremonies that run from
Monday evening to Tuesday evening, and Israelis visit cemeteries to
honor fallen friends, relatives and schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sound twice on Memorial Day, once Monday night
and again Tuesday morning, directing Israelis to stop what they are
doing and pay tribute. Traffic comes to a halt, and drivers stand
next to their cars on streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Ezer Weizman, both
ex-generals, attended the opening ceremony at the Western Wall in
the Old City of Jerusalem, Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Again we are with you, my brothers,'' army chief Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz said at the ceremony, ''and the pain that scorches like
the burn of forged iron is too hard to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   After the two-year war that followed the creation of the state,
Israeli soldiers went to battle again in 1956, 1967, 1973 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a transition ceremony is to take place at the Mt.
Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem, marking the end of Memorial
Day and the beginning of Independence Day, complete with a
fireworks display.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Kentucky to seek death penalty for suspect in kidnap-murder  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kentucky authorities will seek the death
penalty for a New Jersey man accused of kidnapping and murdering a
British computer consultant last month, the FBI said Monday.
However, a Kentucky prosecutor said no decision has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
   Dental records confirmed that the victim was Paul Jeffrey Gale,
who died of strangulation, according to autopsy results announced
Monday by Special Agent Sandra Carroll, a spokeswoman for the
Newark office.
</P>
<P>
   She said dental records were needed because Gale's body had been
burned in an effort to hinder identification following his
abduction April 17 from a hotel room in Florence, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not determined where Gale was killed, but so
far believe the murder happened in Kentucky, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale's family has taken his body back to England, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Gale, 28, of Naples, Fla., was kidnapped and
killed by Gregory J. Marcinski because Gale was dating Marcinski's
former lover.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, 23, of Brick, was arrested April 20 and extradited to
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found in a shallow grave about two miles from
Marcinski's residence April 27 after his housemate, Preston C.
Foray Jr., admitted he helped hide the body and gave agents the
location, the FBI has said in a court filing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They torched the body and apparently ran over it several times
with a truck'' while burying Gale in New Jersey, Carroll said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Foray, 21, was arrested April 26. He faces a federal charge of
being an accessory after the fact of a kidnapping. The two young
men lived with Marcinski's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   A Kentucky prosecutor handling the case, Linda Tally Smith, an
assistant commonwealth attorney for Boone County, said Monday that
no decision has been made on whether to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we get all the lab results back, I don't think it's
prudent to make a definitive statement,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be presented to a Boone County grand jury,
probably on May 23, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kentucky law, kidnapping can be elevated to a capital
offense if the victim is not released alive, and four types of
penalties are available for capital offenses, Smith said: death,
life without parole, no parole for at least 25 years, and a prison
term of at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators and court papers, Marcinski drove his
grandmother's Buick 800 miles and flashed bogus FBI credentials to
get into Gale's room at the Holiday Inn in Florence, Ky., a city
across the Ohio River from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski awakened Gale, handcuffed him, and drove off.
Marcinski told Foray that he killed the man after driving for about
an hour, Foray told agents.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, a native of Birmingham, England, had apartments in Naples,
Fla., and in Mount Laurel, N.J., where he worked as a computer
programmer for TRW Integrated Supply. At the time of his death, he
was working for TRW in Kentucky as a consultant in the merger of
two pharmaceutical companies.

<HEADLINE> China Marks Bombing of Embassy  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In contrast to last year's violent protests,
China marked the first anniversary of NATO's bombing of its embassy
in Yugoslavia with low-key forums, wreath-laying for three people
killed, and newspaper editorials claiming a Chinese triumph over
''evil.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, there was no repeat of the angry mobs who hurled
concrete and shouted anti-American slogans outside the U.S. Embassy
and protested in 20 other cities after five bombs slammed into the
Chinese Embassy on May 7 Belgrade time, May 8 in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Just five or six extra police were stationed Monday in streets
outside the U.S. Embassy. As usual, dozens of people patiently
waited for visa appointments outside the mission's consular
section, which remained open.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a nice quiet spring day in Beijing, for which we are
grateful,'' U.S. Ambassador Joseph Prueher said, walking out of the
renovated embassy compound, which a year ago was besieged, its
front paint-smeared, its windows shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an event that neither the people in the United States nor
the people in China can forget,'' Prueher said. ''This is an event
that occurred that is part of the fabric now of the U.S.-China
relationship. So we must deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials, colleagues and relatives of Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu
and Zhu Ying, three Chinese journalists killed in the attack, laid
flowers Monday at their graves in a cemetery in western Beijing,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It said the bombing and
NATO were condemned at forums for student representatives, scholars
and journalists in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Universities that last year organized buses from campuses to the
embassy district were ordered to keep students under control.
</P>
<P>
   At Peking University, whose students protested in large numbers,
the anniversary passed largely unremarked. The campus was covered
in red banners. Posters advertised opportunities for overseas study
in the United States, Canada and other NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because we're not out protesting doesn't mean we don't
think about it. We're still angry,'' said Xiong Yuanmeng, an
economics major.
</P>
<P>
   The attack sent China-U.S. relations to their lowest point in a
decade and prompted an outburst of patriotism that the ruling
Communist Party has used to bolster its hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this contest between justice and evil and between truth and
power politics, we launched a firm struggle and won a major
victory,'' People's Daily, the party newspaper, said in a
front-page editorial marking the bombing that all national
newspapers also carried.
</P>
<P>
   China opposed NATO's war with Yugoslavia over Kosovo and still
accuses the United States and other Western powers of interfering
in the affairs of less powerful nations.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Still Reeling Over Real  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The high cost of credit,
complicated tax systems, inefficient governments and unruly
macroeconomic indicators were all blamed for hindering Latin
America's competitiveness during a major trade conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension simmering below the surface at the Mercosur
Economic Summit had mostly to do with last year's devaluation of
the Brazilian real and the monkey wrench it threw into trade
relations between Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much has been done quickly, but not quickly enough considering
(recent financial problems) in Mexico, Russia, Asia and last year's
devaluation in Brazil,'' said Arturo T. Acevedo, president of
Argentine steel maker Acindar.
</P>
<P>
   The January 1999 devaluation sharply raised the prices of
Argentine goods in Brazil, quickly dampening Argentina's chief
export market. Further aggravating matters, many Argentine
companies fled to Brazil where the cost of doing business is
significantly cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's former finance minister, Domingo Cavallo, recently
said the devaluation had effectively killed the Mercosur trade
bloc, comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, Bolivia
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1991, Mercosur represents a market with a combined
gross domestic product of more than $1 trillion and a consumer
market made up of the region's 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders also used the conference to rail at
protectionism in the first world.
</P>
<P>
   Jorio Dauster, president of Brazilian mining giant Companhia
Vale do Rio Doce, complained of what he called ''a deeply
asymmetrical globalization,'' in which first world countries have
easy access to third world markets for their exports while traffic
in the opposite direction is often impeded.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to recognize a deep inequality in that Latin American
products don't have access to markets that would be correct and
desirable in capital terms,'' Dauster said, adding that in many
cases these barriers were cloaked in the veil of environmental or
social protections.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping above the fray, Brazilian Central Bank President Arminio
Fraga offered an upbeat assessment of the economy and said the cost
of credit would decline as economic indicators improved.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga said the country should grow 4 percent this year and more
than 5 percent in the medium-term.
</P>
<P>
   But Fraga also conceded that advances needed to be made in the
area of education, tax reform and financial transparency.

<HEADLINE> Ky. School Team Wins Science Bowl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team from a Louisville, Ky., high school won
the Energy Department's National Science Bowl on Monday, with a
physics question about measuring extremely small distances.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Manual High School defeated last year's winning team,
Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md., in final
minutes of the competition between the five-member teams. The
10-year-old science bowl, held this year in Chevy Chase, Md., is
among the first of this season's national academic competitions.
The National Geographic Geography Bee and the Scripps Howard
Spelling Bee will be held later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In a format similar to the ''College Bowl'' and ''Jeopardy''
quiz shows, the students from DuPont Manual buzzed first to answer
the final question just before time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The final question, in physics, was: ''An angstrom is equal to
how many picometers?'' The Kentucky team's correct answer, ''100,''
gave them the title and an expenses-paid hiking trip across
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   An angstrom -- referring to a value used to measure wavelengths
of visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation such
as ultraviolet or X rays -- is one ten-billionth of a meter.
</P>
<P>
   For 8 days in July, the students will tour and study the state's
environment with scientists from the Energy Department's Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory, which conducts a variety of nuclear
and environmental research. The trip begins at the Hanford Reach of
the Columbia River and ends in the Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland students will take the second-place prize trip to
South Carolina for alligator-watching and an archaeological dig at
the Energy Department's Savannah River environmental research site.
</P>
<P>
   The trips are designed to provide hands-on educational
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who presented the trophy,
invited the nation's youth to ''test the waters of math and
science, which will provide the high-paying jobs of the 21st
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top five teams, which also received trophies
and calculators, were A&AMP;M Consolidated High School, College
Station, Texas; North Hollywood High School, North Hollywood,
Calif., and Gateway High School of Monroe, Pa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philly May Adopt All-Uniform Rule  </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The days of short shorts and concert
T-shirts appear to be numbered in the city's 256 public schools
under a proposal that would make Philadelphia the first big-city
district in the nation to require all students to wear uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The school district board was scheduled to vote Monday night on
a dress-code policy for its 217,000 students. The policy would go
into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The measure does not call for a single, Roman
Catholic-school-style uniform; instead, schools could decide
individually how students should dress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certainly not the answer to academic achievement or
school climate, but I think it can be one component to establishing
respect for the school,'' said Christine James-Brown, head of the
six-member committee of the school district's board that
recommended the policy last week.
</P>
<P>
   James-Brown said schools would be pushed to look at clothes that
are inexpensive and readily available. Punishment for failing to
abide by a dress code would probably not be attached to the policy
for the rest of the school year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline and other particulars, such as provisions for
students who can't wear the uniforms for religious reasons, would
be worked out by a committee of parents, students and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce D. Ryan, principal of James Elverson Middle School,
believes uniforms will also cut back on competition among students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will help add to uniformity of thought,'' Ryan
said. ''It will take their minds off the social aspect of
interacting and put it more on the important facts of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But student Khayree Campbell, an 18-year-old senior at Benjamin
Franklin High School, is strongly opposed to wearing a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does that have to do with learning?'' said Campbell, who
was wearing a tank top and shorts. ''I feel as though you should be
able to wear whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanneka Henry, 15, said she looked forward to the break from
buying fancy clothes to impress friends. ''Everybody wants that
name-brand stuff,'' she said. She said she would use the money she
saves for college.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, educators grappling with school violence are trying
to bust up cliques and limit adolescent isolation. President
Clinton has endorsed dress-code policies, and the Philadelphia
school board looked into the issue last month at the request of
Mayor John Street.
</P>
<P>
   While other cities have uniform policies, no city as large as
Philadelphia, the fifth-biggest in the nation, has a district-wide
policy. In Miami, 60 percent of public schools require uniforms. In
Chicago, the number is 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in New York City's elementary schools voted last year on
whether or not they wanted their children to wear uniforms. About
half of the schools now have a uniform policy.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the National Association of Elementary School
Principals in 1998 found that 52 percent of principals requiring
uniforms reported a boost in student performance.
</P>
<P>
   At John L. Bernstein PS 137 in New York City, students arrived
at school in September wearing crisp, new blue and white uniforms.
In the beginning, the policy appeared to boost student morale,
Principal May Beyda said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in light of the recent heat wave in the city, Beyda
plans to rescind the uniform policy for June. ''We don't have air
conditioning and not all my kids can afford the shorts,'' Beyda
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents at Beyda's school can write a note excusing their
children from wearing uniforms. Otherwise, Beyda said, the school
would face multiple lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Presser, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Pennsylvania, said his organization might challenge
Philadelphia's policy if it were to violate a student's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aside from reading and writing, public schools are supposed to
be teaching democracy,'' Presser said. ''Uniforms are antithetical
to teaching people how to make choices.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Nixes Rebel Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lankan officials said Monday they
will reject a proposal by the Tamil Tiger rebels for a temporary
cease-fire that would allow the evacuation of 40,000 government
troops from the northern city of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   The safe passage offer amounted to a call for the surrender of
the city of 500,000 ''to prevent the further escalation of violence
and a blood bath,'' according to the rebel statement. It was faxed
Monday to news agencies in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, and in
New Delhi from the London office of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire offer will not be accepted because of the
evacuation condition, a senior government official told The
Associated Press in Colombo. He said President Chandrika
Kumaratunga favors peace talks, but will not accept any conditions
or compromise the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a formal statement would be issued later.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombo, Kumaratunga delivered a 30-minute television address
Monday, reiterating her determination to win the war and bring
peace to the country despite the ''temporary setback, a serious
setback.''
</P>
<P>
   She blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, for
not giving a favorable response to her attempts to initiate peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last year I tried through various means to initiate a
peace process with the LTTE. We even obtained the assistance of
foreign countries, but the LTTE did not react favorably,'' she
said, without referring to Monday's cease-fire offer.
</P>
<P>
   The government has indicated it is prepared to fight to hold on
to the city and the nearby Palali air base, the crucial supply link
for troops defending Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   The offer of a truce came as the Sri Lankan air force bombed
rebel artillery positions at Elephant Pass, the land bridge that
the rebels captured last month between the Jaffna Peninsula and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the army was using weaponry newly
acquired on the international arms market to strengthen the new
military defense line, 15 miles southeast of Jaffna, in the hope of
stopping a rebel advance toward the city.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna, considered the center of Tamil culture and history, was
under the rebels' control from 1990-95. During that time, it was
the capital of a virtual Tamil state, which had its own police,
judiciary and border controls. However, the government never lost
control of the Palali airport.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the truce offer were delayed in Sri Lanka by military
censorship that has been imposed on the local and foreign media.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' statement said the LTTE ''is prepared to declare a
temporary cease-fire suspending all armed hostilities against the
Sri Lankan armed forces to facilitate the beleaguered government
troops to be evacuated safely from the Jaffna peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire would come into effect as soon as the Sri Lankan
government responds that it is willing to observe a halt in
fighting, the rebel statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels called upon the International Committee of the Red
Cross ''to supervise and assist the orderly evacuation of troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who were in retreat for years after the Jaffna
peninsula fell to the army in 1996, turned the tide of the war with
an offensive last November that reclaimed hundreds of square miles
in the northern jungles.
</P>
<P>
   They scored another important victory last month when they
seized Elephant Pass, forcing 10,000 Sri Lankan troops to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are demanding an independent country for the Tamil
minority because they say the majority Sinhalese discriminate
against them. The government has denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices Soar  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natural gas prices rocketed 5 percent higher Monday as a
northeastern U.S. heat wave intensified concerns that summer demand
will outstrip supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The price rise highlighted strong gains for energy products on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil futures shot to a
six-week high and gasoline and heating oil also jumped more than 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, corn and cocoa tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Hotter-than-usual weather in the densely populated Northeast in
recent days, including temperatures in the low 90s in some places,
has sent residents reaching for their air-conditioner knobs at a
time when energy supplies are already stretched.
</P>
<P>
   With summer's heat just ahead, there's concern now that the
industry won't be able to refill inventory before the next heating
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is kind of a critical period for natural gas because at
the end of March you start injecting storage, and storage
injections have been very slow,'' said Bill O'Grady, energy analyst
for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The faster it gets warm, the more natural gas is going to be
used and the less is going to be there to inject for storage,'' he
said. ''It's raising fears that if it's doing this in early May,
maybe it'll do it all summer -- although of course it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas for June delivery rose 14.5 cents to $3.17 per 1,000
cubic feet -- an increase that nearly doubled the amount of Friday's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Crude's rise was attributed to a continuing strike by
private-sector workers in Norway which is reducing production by
about 1 million barrels a day, and to indications from OPEC that
there are no current plans to increase production in June.
</P>
<P>
   June intermediate crude rose 80 cents to $28.09, while June
heating oil rose 2.27 cents to 69.58 cents a gallon and June
unleaded gasoline rose 3.73 cents to 94.08 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent crude from
the North Sea rose 79 cents to $26.08 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Corn took the biggest fall when weather forecasts calling for as
much as two inches in the Midwest this week provoked a selloff of
grains and soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The soggy weather would wash away some of the concerns about a
potentially severe drought impact this year.
</P>
<P>
   July corn fell 7\ cents to $2.41 a bushel, while July soybeans
fell 7 cents to $5.59 a bushel, July wheat fell 4 cents to $2.68} a
bushel and July oats fell 1} cent to $1.23\ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa slumped on still-lackluster world demand. Months after the
top crops from West Africa hit the market, they have yet to be
absorbed and supplies remain plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   July cocoa settled $23 lower at $778 a ton on New York's Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Plant Neighbors Seek Help  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with homemade maps showing which way the
winds blow and where cancer victims live, neighbors of nuclear
weapons plants spread across Capitol Hill on Monday to lobby for
lifetime medical testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a comprehensive program to monitor our health and
train local doctors to treat us properly,'' said Doris Smith, who
lives on a farm near the Pantex Nuclear Plant outside Amarillo,
Texas. ''We did not choose to be part of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy, which oversees the nation's network of
roughly 20 nuclear weapons research labs, processing plants and
assembly facilities, has wrestled for years with the legacy of Cold
War-era practices that sometimes placed bomb production and secrecy
over safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, the government has declassified documents
showing releases of uranium, tritium and other radioactive
materials from the plants. Also documented: worker exposure to
plutonium and unsafe storage practices that led to dangerous
chemicals leaching into drinking water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   DOE recently asked Congress for permission to give a minimum of
$100,000 to weapons plant workers who developed radiation-related
cancers. Plant neighbors hope the move bodes well for their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schaeffer of the Alliance for Nuclear Accountability said he
has arranged similar lobbying trips, but found a better reception
this year following DOE's overture to plant workers.
</P>
<P>
   The DOE's top health official, Assistant Secretary David
Michaels, said the agency wants to do right by people who have been
harmed, but does not yet have the scientific basis to identify
accurately exposed populations near all the weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe if we made people sick we should take care of them
and if we're exposing people to dangers, we have to stop,''
Michaels said. ''The department has focused a tremendous amount of
energy on the very justified concerns raised by sick workers all
around the complex and we've put tremendous amounts of resources
into re-examining the scientific evidence all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services is conducting
epidemiological studies of weapons-plant neighbors, but it is
impossible to say yet how many people were made ill, Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   People living near the Fernald Environmental Management Project
in Ohio sued in 1985. They reached a settlement four years later
calling for the federal government to spend $78 million for medical
tests, health monitoring and other issues related to plant
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a moral and an ethical issue,'' said Fernald neighbor
Lisa Crawford of Harrison, Ohio. ''It is now time to apply the
Fernald precedent across the complex.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapons complex is diverse and widespread, with some plants,
such as the Nevada Test Site, placed in sparsely populated areas
and others, like Rocky Flats in Denver, in metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to pin down offsite exposures vary, depending on the
sites. The government has already completed a project that
determined how many contaminants were released throughout the
history of the Hanford reservation in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Such projects at other sites are not as far along or more
difficult to compile, the DOE says.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plant neighbors want the government to provide biennial
medical exams; training for local doctors; a computerized archive
of people exposed on the job and outside the plants' perimeters;
and a plain-language description of the risks they face from
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the lobbying activists nor the DOE estimated how many
people might qualify for testing or the cost.

<HEADLINE> Missing Evidence in Lockerbie Case?  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Police officers testifying in the
Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial clutched mangled chunks of the
ill-fated aircraft Monday as they described their meticulous search
of the boggy woodlands around Lockerbie, Scotland, looking for
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the pieces belonged to the aluminum luggage
compartment that contained the suitcase bomb which blew up the
Boeing 747 on Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan defendants Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah are charged with the murders of the 270 mostly American
victims. They have pleaded innocent, blaming Syrian-backed
Palestinian terrorists for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial resumed after a weekend break, both sides sought to
lay the groundwork for their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hoped to establish the reliability of their evidence
by calling 11 police officers to testify about the procedures they
used in retrieving and identifying the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers challenged the witnesses' testimony and pressed
them on details they apparently plan to cite in the later defense
phase.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers said they combed the countryside in line
formation looking for evidence that could help determine the cause
of the crash. They tagged the pieces, placed them in polyethelene
bags and sent them to the collection points to be X-rayed and
catalogued.
</P>
<P>
   A court employee warned retired detective Alexander Arnout to be
careful of sharp edges as he handed him a piece of twisted metal.
Arnout confirmed that he came across the piece at 11:10 a.m. on
Dec. 27. It was later identified as part of luggage container
AVE-4041, which held the brown Samsonite suitcase with the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Kevin Murray said he identified another piece of AVE-4041
when he came across a piece of wreckage that ''appeared to have
shrapnel holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appeared to have been penetrated by some kind of
explosion,'' he said. ''It was also blackened by some form of
residue.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottish police officer Douglas Roxburgh admitted when
questioned by Fhimah lawyer Richard Keen that he had raised
concerns with superiors about the possibility of missing evidence
in the early days of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Roxburgh, who supervised a collection point, said he had noticed
that ''someone had taken off property where there had been traces
of explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he refused to confirm Keen's suggestion that
intelligence agencies had been involved in the disappearance and
said he established that no security breach was involved.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a compromise that persuaded Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects, the Lockerbie proceedings,
expected to last a year, are being held at a former U.S. Air Force
base 40 miles east of Amsterdam. If found guilty, the defendants
face life in prison.

<HEADLINE> New Kosovo Commander at Helm  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid a rash of violence, the new
commander of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo warned Monday that Western
governments will withhold support if attacks on minority groups
persist.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Lt. Gen. Juan Ortuno pledged that his term in command of
NATO-led troops would be marked by efforts to foster harmony in a
province struggling to overcome a war and a decade of oppression
under the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno told reporters in his first news conference that he
wanted to win the ''hearts and minds'' of ethnic Albanians, the
Serbs and others that make up Kosovo -- in part by fighting for more
funding to the perennially cash-strapped mission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he warned that Western efforts to help must be met in
equal measure by efforts from Kosovo residents to take individual
responsibility in promoting tolerance -- or ultimately risk losing
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus of the world is still on Kosovo, but this will not
last forever,'' he said. ''The people of Kosovo must work together
to build coexistence and to foster tolerance to send the right
signal to the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno spoke amid reports of new violence -- much, if not all,
apparently ethnically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kosovo Serbs were shot and wounded by ethnic Albanians on
Sunday, and a former regional commander of the disbanded Kosovo
Liberation Army was shot and killed Monday in the southern town of
Prizren, peacekeepers and U.N. police reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ekrem Rexha, better known by his nickname Drini, was the former
KLA commander for southern Kosovo. He was killed outside his home.
U.N. police said Drini was now serving in the local Prizren
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno, who took command from German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt in
April, suggested that people should register to vote in coming
elections and support Western initiatives, such as the return of
refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Serbs and other minorities have fled from
their homes since the arrival of peacekeepers after NATO's 78-day
air war last year to halt Milosevic's attacks on ethnic Albanians.
The Serbs and other minorities have feared attacks leveled in
revenge for Milosevic's 18-month-long crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Pay Homage to O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Politicians of many stripes and faiths sat
elbow-to-elbow in St. Patrick's Cathedral for the funeral of
Cardinal John O'Connor, a sign of the political potency of the
nation's 28 million Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, a couple of
Baptists, sat near the two George Bushes, the elder Episcopalian,
the younger Methodist. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Catholic, was a
row behind first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Methodist herself.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those present had differed with O'Connor's strong
opposition to abortion or his views on other issues. But
differences disappeared Monday in a turnout by the Washington and
New York political elite that seemed almost like a state funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the funeral Mass for O'Connor, who died last
week, also included New York Gov. George Pataki and nearly 40
percent of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Catholic vote is one of the largest, if not one of the
most important, swing votes today,'' said Raymond Flynn, the former
mayor of Boston and U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, one of the
3,500 invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   As for politicians attending, he said, ''Just to be associated
with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church is one way to ingratiate
yourself with the Catholic people across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani and Hillary Clinton, rivals for a New York Senate
seat, and for Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Democratic
and Republican candidates for president, that's crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, former President Bush, sat with O'Connor's family
across the aisle from the Clintons. The younger Bush had offended
some Catholics earlier in the year by speaking at Bob Jones
University, a Christian school whose leader has espoused
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside his wife, George W. Bush said upon arriving at
LaGuardia Airport: ''Laura and I are honored to be here to say our
prayers on behalf of this man. He's a man who stood for the
disadvantaged and the impoverished, and he was a strong voice for
life in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a friend,'' said Gore, speaking after The Associated
Press annual meeting. He pointed in particular to O'Connor's
support of Tipper Gore's campaign to persuade music companies to
include parental advisories on CD covers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Langan, professor of Catholic social thought at
Georgetown University, said the funeral was a chance for
politicians to show both their respect for the cardinal and their
interest in the Catholic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that it's, in a sense, the whole package,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, said John Kenneth White, a politics professor at the
Catholic University of America, had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of saying this is the real me, not the person who
was there at Bob Jones,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American Catholics are increasingly inclined to
go their own way on matters of faith and morals, O'Connor staunchly
championed the Vatican line against birth control, abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   From the pulpit, O'Connor also weighed in on local and national
political matters.
</P>
<P>
   He battled with prominent Catholic abortion rights supporters,
most notably former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Geraldine
Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the visiting politicians were allowed to speak at
Monday's service, Flynn, the former Boston mayor, said O'Connor
would never have missed the chance to address such an assembly of
political power.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to hear that one,'' Flynn said. ''I wish he were
back for one more day.''

<HEADLINE> Suspected Rail Killer Goes on Trial  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Lawyers for a drifter accused of being the Texas
Railroad Killer acknowledged Monday that he's responsible for nine
murders in three states and entered an insanity plea at the start
of his trial for one of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Maturino Resendiz, 40, faces the death penalty if
convicted of the December 1998 murder of Dr. Claudia Benton at her
home. She is one of six people he is accused of killing in Texas,
two in Illinois and one in Kentucky from 1997 to 1999. The slayings
all took place near train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, a drifter from Mexico, surrendered 23 days
after he was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he turned himself in, and when we met him and talked to
him, when doctors have talked to him, the defendant has no remorse
for any of his crimes,'' defense attorney Allen Tanner told the
jury during opening statements. ''The defendant in his mind thinks
these people were evil and deserved to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes said fingerprints
on a jewelry box, a button and pieces of broken plastic from the
steering column of Benton's Jeep Cherokee tie Maturino Resendiz to
the scene of her murder. DNA and blood evidence tie him to her
murder and rape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner showed the jury copies of letters the accused killer had
written from jail in which he complained of micro-organisms, of his
treatment in jail and of being an ''angel of God.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two letters, Maturino Resendiz warns of a virus ''100
times faster than ebola and able to transfer by air,'' of sharing
information ''like dolphins'' and of how authorities had not lived
up to agreements he made before turning himself in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told at the border I was to get unrestricted visits,''
he wrote. ''That was a false promise; that I could get kosher. I
never received kosher.
</P>
<P>
   ''The humane treatment I will get will be the death sentence,''
he continued. ''I will go. I will not beg for my life. I was to be
sent to a mental hospital but that will not happen. The USA will
never, never keep a promise ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ''Letters such as those letters and the defendant's feeling that
these people needed to be killed show that something is seriously
wrong up here,'' Tanner said, pointing to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz sat quietly at the defense table. During a
pre-trial hearing he said he didn't want the insanity defense and
initially refused to talk with a court-appointed psychiatrist,
until State District Judge Bill Harmon threatened to limit use of
the insanity defense if he continued to resist.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was delayed to give the psychiatrist time to finish a
written report on Maturino Resendiz.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz has complained that the prospect of lethal
injection violates the humane treatment that his family had
requested when he gave up after a six-week international manhunt.
He surrendered to a Texas Ranger on July 13 at a remote border
crossing between Mexico and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The first prosecution witnesses were colleagues of Benton at
Baylor College of Medicine, where she was a researcher
investigating a rare genetic disorder known as Angelman syndrome.
She was home alone because her husband and twin daughters were out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   Her associates told how they became concerned when she didn't
show up for work on Dec. 17, 1998. One of her colleagues, Dr. David
Stockton, his voice wavering, told how he arrived at the house as
officers ''were just beginning to unroll the yellow crime scene
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Benton's husband, George, testified how he was called by his
wife's co-workers worried about her failure to show up. ''I became
very worried,'' he said. ''She was very responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he called a friend to check the house, and subsequently
received a call from police who ''gave me the news my wife had been
murdered in my house.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Affirmative Action Move Stalls  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MARK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A petition drive to place an
anti-affirmative action measure on the statewide ballot was called
off Monday by the man who started similar campaigns in California
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Ward Connerly said there is not enough time to gather
the necessary 500,000 signatures by the August deadline. He
promised to try another petition drive in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's move came only days after the Legislature passed
portions of Gov. Jeb Bush's One Florida plan, which bans
consideration of race and gender in university admissions and
contracting decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had called Connerly's ballot measure divisive. His plan
toughens anti-discrimination laws and guarantees admission to a
state university for the top 20 percent of each high school class.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said Monday that Bush's plan didn't go nearly far
enough in ending traditional affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a 39-cent hamburger,'' said Connerly, of Sacramento,
Calif. ''Big bun, no pickle, no lettuce, no tomato, teeny-weeny
patty. It reminds you of that old commercial -- where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Bush's office praised Connerly's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gov. Bush is pleased that the initiative is not going to be on
the ballot because he believed it would be divisive for the
state,'' said spokesman Justin Sayfie. ''The governor's trying to
steer a course that everyone can support.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the governor's One Florida plan was announced in November,
it has drawn a torrent of criticism from minorities who said it
would eliminate hard-earned gains from the civil rights era. Two
legislators staged a sit-in inside the governor's offices, and
11,000 people marched on the Capitol during the opening of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As the protests wore on, Bush scaled back parts of the original
proposal. In February he said he would not pursue legislation to
extend a ban on racial and gender preferences in contract awards to
state agencies that do not report to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said Monday that Bush had caved in to the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's group, The Florida Civil Rights Initiative, was
sponsoring four proposed amendments. One would have barred
preferences in public education, contracting and employment based
on gender, race, color, national origin and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Three smaller measures would have outlawed preference on the
basis of race, color, national origin and ethnicity -- but not
gender -- in public education, contracting and employment.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court heard arguments in March but had not
yet ruled on whether Connerly's petition was legal. The court
reviews all citizen initiatives to make sure they deal with a
single subject and that the ballot titles and summaries clearly
explain the proposed amendments to the state's constitution.

<HEADLINE> Assembly committee passes $90 million fire sprinkler bill  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Public and private colleges in New Jersey
would have to install fire sprinklers in every dorm room, but
they'd have five years -- instead of two -- to do it, under a bill
that passed an Assembly committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers responded to pleas from college representatives and
the people who install the sprinklers for more time to get the work
completed.
</P>
<P>
   They said the original two-year deadline, approved by the Senate
in March, would be impossible to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is in response to a fire at Seton Hall
University in January, which killed three students and injured 62
others. Seton Hall is installing sprinklers in every room in time
for the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   State senators and the Whitman administration had been pushing
to get the sprinklers installed in all New Jersey dorms within two
years. But they had also acknowledged that the deadline would be
tough to meet.
</P>
<P>
   So, Assembly lawmakers proposed a compromise: two years to
outfit the dormitory common areas and four years to finish all the
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing Monday before the Assembly Housing Committee,
representatives from both colleges and the sprinkler industry
rejected that compromise, saying it would make the job more
difficult and more costly.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Richman, assistant commissioner at the state Department
of Community Affairs, pushed for the tighter deadlines, saying the
industry could get all the work done in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But, Richard Hodvance, vice president of the New Jersey State
Association of Pipe Trades, said doing the work in phases would add
15 percent to 20 percent to the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   The committee unanimously passed the bill that calls for a
five-year time frame, requiring schools to complete 20 percent of
the work each year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities would also have to submit a plan to
the state Department of Community Affairs four months after the
bill is signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Girgenti, D-Passaic, said he expects the Senate to
concur with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers hope to have the bill in place by June.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also appropriate $90 million to help pay for
the sprinklers. Public and private colleges and universities would
get zero-interest loans, while boarding schools, military academies
and other schools that have dorms would have to repay the loans at
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows exemptions for certain buildings. That would
most likely apply to ''very small'' buildings, said Richman.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate that more than 36,000 college dorm beds
are located in rooms without sprinklers.

<HEADLINE> Llosa Calls Fujimori a Dictator  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's famed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa
lashed out on Monday at President Alberto Fujimori, calling him a
dictator who uses extortion and spying to cling to power.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare visit to his homeland, the 64-year-old Vargas Llosa
called the Peruvian president a modern-day version of Dominican
strongman Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, who is the subject of the
author's latest novel entitled ''The Goat's Party.''
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with foreign correspondents, the author, who
was defeated by Fujimori in the 1990 presidential election, said
Trujillo resorted to murder and torture to hang onto power for
three decades until he was assassinated in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fujimori, on the other hand, has had to maintain a
democratic facade because overt dictatorships face international
isolation in today's world. He said that Fujimori instead has used
electronic surveillance, blackmail, tax audits and threats of
expropriation of property to silence critics and maintain control.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Trujillo's brutality, ''these intimidating methods are
invisible, and cannot be proven or demonstrated,'' he said. ''In
many cases it seems like paranoia by citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas Llosa's stunning upset loss to Fujimori in 1990 initiated
a decade in power for Fujimori that would be extended another five
years if he wins re-election in this month's presidential runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas Llosa, who has visited Peru only three times in the last
eight years, said one of the reasons he had returned was to express
support for Fujimori's opponent, economist Alejandro Toledo, in the
May 28 election.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's 11th hour surge from a field of eight opposition
candidates blocked Fujimori from winning a majority of votes in the
first round, which he needed to avoid a runoff. Fujimori fell a
hair short, with 49.9 percent of the votes to Toledo's 40.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is that what happened in the first round surprised
me, as I think it surprised everyone inside and outside Peru. I
saw, as many did, a light at the end of the tunnel,'' Vargas Llosa
said.
</P>
<P>
   The author said Fujimori tried to rig the vote total to win a
first-round victory on April 9, but was frustrated by international
monitors and massive street protests on the night of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas Llosa predicted that if international pressure is
maintained and Peruvians remain alert against any signs of fraud,
''we can put an end to these eight years of an authoritarian regime
that has made our country the exception to the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Fujimori shut down an opposition-controlled Congress
and the courts, saying they were crippling his efforts to defeat
leftist rebels and impose free-market reforms to end economic
chaos. Fujimori supporters won control of a new Congress elected
six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas Llosa, who now lives in London, denied charges by
Fujimori's defenders that he has condemned Peru's government as
dictatorial because he is bitter over his election defeat by
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is Peruvians did me a favor by returning me to my
writer's desk in 1990 because only good things have happened to me
as a writer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his time on the campaign trail, he added, ''I
learned a lot of things about my country. I also learned a lot
about myself. I learned I wasn't a politician.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slumped again Friday, adding to last

minds.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell ] point,

Telerate.
</P>
<P>
   Traders continue to fret about the possibility the Federal

cool down the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and higher inflation both hurt investments
with fixed returns, such as bonds.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party faction complains about Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A faction of Independence Party leaders
called Monday for U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton to
apologize for remarks she made at a party forum if she wants their
support.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was close to receiving endorsement from party
leaders even without a primary before her speech at the April 29
forum, said Jeff Graham, former Watertown mayor and party leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in time, her chances of a primary-proof
convention are virtually nil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had said she would not share a ticket with conservative
Pat Buchanan if he runs on the Reform Party's line for president.
The Independence Party is Reform's New York wing.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also took a direct slap at Lenora Fulani, a
former leader of the left-leaning New Alliance Party, who has
become a force in the Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pat Buchanan and his ally Lenora Fulani have a long history of
making divisive and anti-Semitic statements and Hillary isn't going
to apologize for speaking the truth,'' Clinton campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson said. ''The person who should apologize is Rudy
Giuliani for waffling on running on the same ticket as Pat
Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party Secretary Laureen Oliver accused Clinton
Monday of trying to ''sabotage'' the party by speaking ill of some
of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past six years, state Democrats have tried to take
over this party,'' Oliver said. ''And now Hillary Clinton comes
along and tries to sabotage it because her and her party can't
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's Senate rival New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani later expressed similar reservations about Buchanan, those
at Monday's news conference said the Republican mayor was not as
much at fault because his remarks were not made at the party's
forum.
</P>
<P>
   Hope released a statement Monday saying she ''never meant to
imply that all leaders and members of the Independence Party
indulge in anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign did not immediately return a call though
Hope's statement said she looks forward to continuing a good
working relationship with ''much of the Independence Party
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kaufman, also of the Democratic Party, called charges
about taking over the Independence Party ''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioned briefly at the news conference was squabbling among
the party leaders. Last month, a state judge reinstated Jack
Essenberg as party chairman, overturning his earlier ouster by
others in the party including Frank MacKay, who was voted in as the
party's new chairman. MacKay took part in Monday's news conference.

<HEADLINE> Spaniards Protest Writer's Slaying  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spaniards stood in silence nationwide
Monday to protest the killing of a newspaper columnist, a slaying
blamed on Basque separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the news media expressed fear that separatists may
target other journalists or intimidate them against telling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands gathered in silence throughout the day in
Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastian and other Spanish cities and towns
to remember Jose Luis Lopez de Lacalle, a political columnist and
critic of ETA, who was gunned down early Sunday in the Basque
region.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- whose initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Freedom and Homeland -- has killed some 800 people since 1968, when
it began its independence campaign of shootings and bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ETA did not claim responsibility for the Lopez's killing.
Spanish police, news media and politicians blamed the shooting on
separatist commandos.
</P>
<P>
   In Andoain, Lopez's hometown, a large crowd shouted ''Freedom,
freedom'' and ''ETA out'' as the journalist's coffin was carried
into the hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish government ministers, the president of the Basque
region, and politicians from different parties joined Lopez's
family to bury the journalist.
</P>
<P>
   After the funeral, thousands of people marched in silence
through Andoain to where the shooting took place Sunday outside
Lopez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia joined a silent vigil
from a balcony of the southern city hall of Jerez de la Frontera,
one of many vigils in front of city and town halls.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, on an official visit to
Morocco, condemned the killing and called for early elections in
the Basque country, saying that democracy and the ballot box are
''the only answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You must be democratic before being nationalist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of El Mundo, the newspaper that ran Lopez's weekly
column, held a somber gathering outside the newspaper's office in
Madrid to remember their colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 62, was shot as he strolled home from his routine morning
walk to a newspaper stand and then to a cafe for a croissant and
coffee in the Basque town of Andoain.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ETA has mostly targeted police officers, soldiers and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish journalists say Lopez's slaying and recent attempts on
the lives of other journalists show the group has added easier prey
-- the press -- to its list of targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''ETA wants to provoke fear in society and doesn't want
journalists to tell the truth,'' said Casimiro Garcia Abadillo, a
director at El Mundo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Journalists are an easy target. They don't have bodyguards or
protection, and they don't take the same precautions as a
politician or a Civil Guard,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Come To Honor O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor was buried Monday beneath
the St. Patrick's Cathedral altar that was his pulpit for 16 years,
after a funeral Mass that drew thousands of mourners, from
presidents to ordinary parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ''God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon
rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit and
an outrageous sense of humor -- all of which he used in the service
of preaching,'' Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, a close friend of
O'Connor's for the past 35 years, said in his homily.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, died Wednesday of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,500 mourners packed inside the church erupted in applause
as pallbearers took O'Connor's casket to a crypt beneath the
cathedral. Outside, hundreds of people stood eight to 10 deep on a
91-degree day to listen to the Mass over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton headed the long list of dignitaries who
attended the Mass for O'Connor, who came to New York in 1984 from
Scranton, Pa., and was appointed in 1985 as head of the nation's
third-largest archdiocese, with 2.4 million Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of its location in New York, the archdiocese is the
most prominent Roman Catholic pulpit in the nation, and O'Connor
was a perfect fit in the media capital, serving as Pope John Paul
II's most forceful spokesman in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made this pulpit unique in the history of the Catholic
Church in the United States,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, through the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, sent his condolences to O'Connor's family. Speaking
at the start of the service, Sodano -- who carried O'Connor's staff
into the church -- sounded a theme of celebration rather than loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord, we don't complain because you have taken him from us,''
Sodano told a hushed crowd inside the cathedral. ''But rather we
will thank you for giving him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass opened with a 45-minute procession of 1,000 of
O'Connor's fellow clergy. Each passing priest gently touched the
cardinal's coffin, which was draped in white linen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the priests wore special vestments that had been
designed for the pope's 1995 visit to New York. Among those in
attendance was Bishop Edward Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., believed to
be the front-runner to replace O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was involved in planning the funeral, picking many of
the prayers and songs, including the recessional hymn, ''Lift High
the Cross,'' which was performed when O'Connor was installed as
head of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, O'Connor's dark wood casket was
splashed with holy water. An honor guard carried the casket down a
narrow staircase beneath the altar, where all previous archbishops
of New York are buried.
</P>
<P>
   A one-legged boy, 8-year-old Alexander Garrett, propped himself
up on crutches and stood clapping in the aisle as the casket went
past.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, there was another ovation, when Law linked O'Connor's
opposition to abortion, euthanasia and capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder
that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The applause lasted 75 seconds and grew into a standing ovation
that spread from the back of the church to the front, eventually
including Clinton, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other politicians who
support abortion rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous four days, tens of thousands of New Yorkers
visited O'Connor's open casket to pay their respects. Adela Sanchez
of New Rochelle said she was disappointed she missed the public
viewing, but she joined in the crowd that gathered on Fifth Avenue
outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Many bowed their heads, clasping rosary beads and mouthing
prayers and hymns as the service was broadcast on loudspeakers,
straining to hear over the hum of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was charming, so friendly,'' Sanchez said. ''He really
showed all his affection to you. In all ways, he was a terrific
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the funeral and invitation-only Mass were Clinton
and his wife, Hillary; former President Bush; presidential
candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush; U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan; Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer; Gov.
George Pataki; and 15 cardinals from the Vatican, the United States
and four other countries. Giuliani greeted the guests and shook
hands with Mrs. Clinton, his rival in a bitter Senate race. The
cardinal's two sisters and a brother attended.
</P>
<P>
   There were also those whose lives the cardinal had touched. Rep.
Carolyn McCarthy was a Long Island housewife in 1993 when her
husband was killed and her son critically wounded by a gunman on
the Long Island Rail Road.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal sent her a letter offering his sympathy but
promising the shootings would change the path of her life. McCarthy
was later elected to Congress as a strong advocate of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what made him a great man,'' she said. ''He always
reached out to ordinary people. It didn't matter what religion you
were. He was truly a shepherd to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's coffin was placed near that of Pierre Toussaint, a
19th-century Haitian whose cause for sainthood was supported by
O'Connor. That portion of the ceremony was private, attended by
only O'Connor's relatives and a small group of church officials.

<HEADLINE> NATO Revises Serb Tank Hits  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shortly after NATO's air war in Kosovo last
year, an Air Force damage assessment team sent into the Serbian
province found the destroyed remnants of only 14 Serb army tanks,
18 armored personnel carriers and 20 artillery and mortar pieces,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That is far fewer than NATO originally believed were destroyed
in 78 days of airstrikes, although the Air Force team later used
satellite photographs and other sources to raise estimates of
destroyed Serb heavy weapons, Air Force Brig. Gen. John D.W. Corley
told a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Corley is director of studies and analysis at the Air Force's
European headquarters in Germany. He headed the postwar assessments
of airstrikes inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who oversaw the NATO air war as Supreme
Allied Commander Europe, reported last fall that the Air Force
concluded it struck 93 Serb tanks and 153 armored personnel
carriers. Those figures include the 14 tanks and 18 armored
personnel carriers found in the field with ''catastrophic damage,''
plus strikes deemed to have been successful based on indirect
evidence such as imagery from satellites, U-2 spy planes and
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, plus interviews with pilots and
airborne forward air controllers who did the target spotting for
allied strike aircraft during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Corley said the Air Force counted 26 tank carcasses in Kosovo,
although other officials later said this included 12 self-propelled
artillery pieces. The Air Force included the 12 in the tank
category because the howitzers looked like tanks from the air and
are used in combat much as tanks are.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the war ended last June with Slobodan
Milosevic, Serbia's president, capitulating to NATO's terms,
critics began claiming that air strikes against mobile targets in
Kosovo such as tanks -- as opposed to strategic targets elsewhere in
Yugoslavia, such as buildings in Belgrade -- were less effective
than NATO claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 1 at a Pentagon news conference, Clark announced he
had ordered a ''bomb damage survey'' of Kosovo, but in the meantime
he believed 110 Serb tanks and 210 armored personnel carriers had
been hit.
</P>
<P>
   Corley, speaking to reporters by telephone from Kirtland Air
Force Base, N.M., denied that NATO exaggerated its claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''In no way have we ever overstated, understated'' the
effectiveness of the air campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the argument about how
many tanks and other heavy weapons were struck is beside the point.
''We obviously hit enough tanks and other targets to win,'' he
said.

rates and took profits from a modest rally on Friday. Technology
stocks fell.
</P>
<P>

   Beyond the technology sector, investors stayed resolutely on the
sidelines, pondering next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve,
which is expected to raise interest rates for the sixth time since
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists expect the Fed to raise rates by as much as a
half-percentage point. The last five rate increases have come in a
series of modest, quarter-percentage point hikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The momentum in the economy gives the Fed ample reason to
boost rates'' by a half-point, said Joseph T. Keating, chief
investment officer for the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   While some Wall Street analysts believe investors would welcome
a sharper increase as a sign that the Fed is finally nearing the
end of its cycle of rate increases, the uncertainty has contributed
to a sharp drop in trading activity in the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the entrenched optimism in the market, investors will
not be able to ignore a more aggressive Federal Reserve,'' said
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates are generally bad for stocks because they
cut into corporate profits by increasing the cost of borrowing
money. Last week, the rate-sensitive financial sector bore the
brunt of investors' worries and fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks outperformed the broader market as investors
bought them at reduced prices. American Express rose 5 7/16 to 152
1/16 and J.P. Morgan rose 3 11/16 to 125 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Financial stocks are probably due for a rebound,'' Keating
said. ''But that sector, more than any other, needs some sign that
the Fed's tightening cycle is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions stimulated some trading activity.
Verio, an Internet service provider and Web hosting company, soared
22] to 58 5/16 after Japan's NTT Communications Corp. agreed to
acquire it for about $5 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ancor Communications rose 7 to 38 3/16 after agreeing to be
acquired by Qlogic Corp. in a stock deal valued at about $1.7
billion. Both Ancor and Qlogic make equipment for computer-storage
networks. Qlogic shares plunged 25 3/16 to 74}.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange and by a 9-to-5 margin on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 946.33 million shares, compared
with 964.65 million in the previous session. The Nasdaq also had
its quietest day of 2000, with 1.11 billion shares changing hands
as of 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.76 to
500.08.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.3 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 1.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.4
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.5 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Member publishers attend AP annual meeting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press is launching new
initiatives to help members tap Internet opportunities as it
enhances state reports and political coverage, Louis D. Boccardi,
the AP's president and chief executive officer, told the news
cooperative's annual meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was attended by executives representing AP's 1,546
member newspapers on the first full day of the Newspaper
Association of America's convention. The meeting also featured a
panel on the 2000 elections and talks by Vice President Al Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   AP Chairman Donald E. Newhouse called the meeting to order, and
Boccardi reported on the state of AP.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi said the coming year would bring ''an ever-stronger
world and national news report; further exploration of the
opportunities and challenges the Internet presents, (and) sharper
focus on better performance on all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the AP is introducing a Web site called
the AP Election Center, ''for online readers who want as much
detail as they can get on the candidates, the issues and the
campaigns, from the White House to this interesting little thing
we've got going on in New York state this year'' -- referring to the
U.S. Senate race between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site for political reporters called AP Politics
offers a wealth of information, including campaign finances and
poll results, he said. And a forthcoming Web site called Your AP
will allow editors to access election results in November as soon
as the come into the AP system, rather than waiting for updates to
move on the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll know what we know when we know it,'' Boccardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Your AP will be an ongoing resource that keeps member editors
and publishers up to date on the AP news report and developments
within the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi said state news reports will soon be delivered in a
format that will enable editors of online editions to post them
easily to newspaper Web sites, and Web site addresses have been
added to the bottom of many AP stories.
</P>
<P>
   The AP's continuing commitment to improving state reports has
resulted in two new Chicago-based positions, Boccardi said. One is
a new writing coach -- AP's third -- and the other is a new deputy
director of state news.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used his appearance to bash as too risky a proposal by his
Republican presidential rival George W. Bush to invest a portion of
Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is associated with some risk because ideas that look very
beguiling when the markets are great may not look so great if the
market turns,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman Dan Bartlett later defended the proposal by
saying that ''what history has shown is the market, over a period
of time, has had a rate of return far greater than the Social
Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is to address many of the same executives by
satellite Wednesday as part of the NAA convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he was open to a change in federal rules that
prohibit the same company from owning a newspaper and TV or radio
station in the same area, although he noted that it is up to the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he supported revising estate tax laws that create
hardship for families trying to pass a newspaper on from one
generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who spoke at the event's luncheon, said President
Clinton was approaching his summit talks with Russian President
Vladimir Putin with an open mind on the subject of U.S. missile
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton decides later this year whether to proceed with an
anti-missile program, he will weigh potential threats as well as
the merits of the technology and the costs, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   AP members also heard from Alan Diaz, the photographer who took
the AP photographs inside the house where 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
was seized by federal agents late last month.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the raid, ''I had the instinct, the hunch,
that something was going to go down,'' Diaz said. When the raid
began, he immediately sprinted into the house and set up in the
room where the boy was being hidden in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   His overriding memory of the raid? ''All I could hear, and all I
could remember, was Elian crying,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi also moderated a discussion of political campaigns with
Walter Mears, AP vice president and Washington columnist; Ron
Fournier, chief political writer in Washington; and Marc A.
Humbert, New York State political editor based in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Mears noted candidates try to avoid negative attacks on their
opponents these days because they think voters don't like it. But
Fournier pointed out that ''the new form of negative campaigning
seems to be to accuse your opponent of going negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting began with the announcement of election results for
the board of directors, held by all-mail balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Four incumbents and three new members were elected to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to new terms were John J. Curley, chairman and CEO,
Gannett Co. Inc., Wilmington (Del.) News-Journal; Newhouse,
president, Advance Publications Inc., Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger;
John W. Madigan, chairman, president and CEO, Tribune Co., Chicago
Tribune and Orage Quarles III, publisher, Raleigh (N.C.) News &AMP;
Observer.
</P>
<P>
   New members are Walter E. Hussman Jr., president and CEO, WEHCO
Media Inc., Arkansas Democrat-Gazette; Julie Inskeep Walda,
publisher, Fort Wayne (Ind.) Journal Gazette; and Sue Mayborn,
president and publisher, Temple (Texas) Daily Telegram. Walda was
selected to fill one year left in the term of Richard J.
Harrington, who is stepping down. Mayborn was selected to represent
a city of less than 50,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   At a reorganization meeting later in the day, Newhouse,
president of Advance Publications Inc. and of The Star-Ledger of
Newark, N.J., was re-elected chairman of the AP. David E. Easterly,
president and COO of Cox Enterprises Inc., representing the Dayton
(Ohio) Daily News, was elected vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Boccardi was re-elected president and chief executive officer of
the news cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Other AP management officers re-elected to one-year terms were
Patrick T. O'Brien, senior vice president and chief financial
officer; James M. Donna, vice president and secretary; and vice
presidents Vincent J. Alabiso, Claude E. Erbsen, Mears, John W.
Reid, Thomas E. Slaughter, Wick Temple and James R. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan P. Wolman, executive editor, also was elected vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel M. Boruch was re-elected treasurer, and Salvatore Focella
and Ann Randolph were re-elected assistant treasurers. Other AP
management officers re-elected were assistant secretaries Lilo
Jedelhauser and Greg Groce.

<HEADLINE> Barak Faces Mideast Peace Dilemma  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the wake of an inconclusive summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
found himself squeezed Monday between territorial demands from the
Palestinians and resistance to land concessions from his closest
political partners.
</P>
<P>
   Barak confirmed for the first time that he wants to give the
Palestinians full control over three West Bank suburbs of
Jerusalem, but that strong political opposition from members of his
own coalition is holding him back.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came in the midst of negotiations for a final peace
treaty meant to address lingering disputes between Israel and the
Palestinians. The Palestinians demand all of the West Bank, Gaza
and east Jerusalem, regions captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast
War. Israel wants to annex large blocs of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza and retain control over all of Jerusalem,
claimed by both sides as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   By handing over the Jerusalem suburbs as a goodwill gesture
during the negotiations, Barak hopes to persuade the Palestinians
to put off discussing a final interim troop withdrawal that will
spark even stronger political opposition in Israel. The troop
withdrawal would give the Palestinians control over more of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, Barak can't appease either the
Palestinians or his own motley coalition. He said Monday that it
may take weeks or months to persuade coalition partners,
particularly the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, to agree to the land
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will hand over the territory ''when the conditions are
ripe, meaning when we will have the necessary agreement, also
politically, within the Israeli system,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said that in exchange for offering the
Palestinians control over the three West Bank suburbs of Jerusalem
-- Abu Dis, Izzarieh and Sawahrah a-Sharkieh -- he wants them to
postpone talks on the interim troop pullback until after an outline
of the final peace treaty has been negotiated. Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, however, said the Palestinians were to have
assumed full control over those villages a long time ago and that
he expected Israel to implement the partial pullback by June, as
per peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians say the concessions Barak is offering fall far
short of what Israel has promised.
</P>
<P>
   They broke off peace talks last week in anger over what they
said was an Israeli proposal to build a Palestinian state in just
two-thirds of the West Bank and part of the Gaza Strip. A
Barak-Arafat summit Sunday night ended with participants reporting
no progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have a very difficult and complicated situation,''
Erekat said. ''The gaps are great.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank towns of Ramallah and Bethlehem, scores of
Palestinians frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations threw
stones at Israeli troops Monday. The troops responded with
rubber-coated steel pellets. Demonstrators demanded that all
Palestinian prisoners be released from Israeli jails -- a key issue
in interim peace accords. At least one person was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators met Monday and were to resume talks Thursday, after
the Israeli holidays of Memorial Day and Independence Day. They are
to produce an outline of a final peace treaty within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting unidentified Palestinian sources, Israel Radio said that
Barak asked Arafat in their meeting to delay most of the deadlines
of the peace accords, including the interim withdrawal due by June,
the planned transfer of the Jerusalem suburbs and the framework
agreement, which has now been set for the next two months. The
radio said Arafat did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, wrapping up a weeklong mediation
trip to the region, met Arafat Monday and said he saw the potential
for progress. But, he said, ''there is a lot of work to be done
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He is to return next week after consulting with President
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Albright may
come to the region next month if there is progress in the talks,
and Barak will meet Clinton in the United States on May 23.

<HEADLINE> NBC Hires Lalas for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former U.S. soccer player Alexi Lalas will join
Andres Cantor, owner of the distinctive ''GOOOOAAAAL'' call, in the
NBC broadcast booth at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas, a defender with bright red hair and goatee, played in two
Olympics and two World Cups for the United States. He was also the
first American to play in the first division of the prestigious
Italian League.
</P>
<P>
   He and Cantor, who created a following for himself during the
past two World Cups with his drawn-out goal calls and fast-paced
broadcasts on Spanish-language Univision, will be the first NBC
Olympic broadcast pair seen from Sydney when they call a Sept. 13
preliminary round men's soccer game on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas retired from Major League Soccer after last season and has
been providing color commentary for the San Jose Earthquakes'
television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas' hiring was announced Monday. Cantor was brought aboard
more than a month ago.

<HEADLINE> Car theft down nationally, up in four N.J. cities  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Car theft rose in New Jersey's four largest
cities last year despite a drop around the nation, according to
crime statistics released by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI statistics released Sunday showed crime overall rose 1.2
percent in Jersey City in 1999, dropped 13 percent in Elizabeth,
0.5 percent in Paterson and 8.2 percent in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime dropped nationally 7 percent, part of an
eight-year nationwide decline in the seven major types of crime
listed in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.
</P>
<P>
   But while car theft dropped across the nation by 8 percent, it
was up 16 percent in Elizabeth, 14.1 percent in Paterson, 10.4
percent in Jersey City and 5.3 percent in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Mark Kurdyla, a spokesman for Elizabeth police, attributed
the increase to the dismantling of some auto theft task forces that
had worked with Elizabeth police and the opening of new shopping
malls like Jersey Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and Newark, which each claim part of Newark
International Airport's car thefts since the airport sits in both
cities, flirted with the nation's highest car theft rate several
years ago, but have kept the rate down since then, Kurdyla said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Five or six years ago, it was an astronomical problem,''
Kurdyla said. ''They pretty much knocked it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City Police Sgt. Edgar Martinez said the city's growing
financial district has attracted new residents who drive expensive
vehicles but have no garages and are forced to park on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've redeployed manpower into areas where there's been an
increase,'' Martinez said. He said police expect the car theft rate
to flatten or decrease in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Newark officials blamed juveniles on the auto theft rate, saying
285 have been arrested more than once for car theft. One juvenile
was arrested 18 times for stealing cars, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Car theft has dropped 67 percent in Newark since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson police didn't return telephone messages seeking comment
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Riley, director of the Rand Criminal Justice Program, a
research institute in Santa Monica, Calif., said auto theft rates
should be compared with the rates of other property crimes for a
sense of any trend.
</P>
<P>
   Absent an overall increase in property crime, an increase in
auto theft could have more to do with a new gang of car thieves
than an overall shift, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate rose 16.7 percent in Newark, increasing from 60
to 70 in 1999. Nine people were killed in Elizabeth in 1999, one
more than in 1998, a 16 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Newark's murders did not occur in 1999, but were included
in police statistics because they were solved last year by the
city's Cold Case Squad, police said. Four of the murders occurred
as a result of domestic violence, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Murders fell 23.5 percent in Paterson and 16.7 percent in Jersey
City in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City also reported a 10.5 percent decrease in burglaries
and a slight decrease in aggravated assault, but had increases in
all other major categories, including a 17.8 percent increase in
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Arson dropped 28.9 percent in Paterson and 14.4 percent in
Newark, but rose 4.5 percent in Elizabeth and 17.8 percent in
Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest change in any category, rapes in Elizabeth fell
44.1 percent, and burglaries were down 39.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdyla said plainclothes detectives and extra officers assigned
on overtime had helped lower the burglary rate.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Cameras at Nichols Trial  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Pre-trial hearings in the murder case
against accused Oklahoma City bombing conspirator Terry Nichols can
be televised, a judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really the right thing to do,'' Associate District Judge
Robert M. Murphy Jr. said, invalidating a court rule in Oklahoma
that prohibits televising criminal court cases when the defendant
objects.
</P>
<P>
   He called the court rule bad public policy and an
unconstitutional infringement on the fundamental right of the press
''to attend and cover criminal proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The courtroom is open to the people,'' Murphy wrote. ''The
courtroom is not the private legal domain of the judge, the lawyers
and the parties. It belongs to the public. Opening the courtroom
doors wider through the camera lens allows the public to better
exercise and enjoy this right.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy will consider pre-trial motions in the case but left
television coverage of the trial itself to the trial judge,
District Judge Steven W. Taylor of McAlester.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the defense and prosecution have objected to
cameras in the courtroom in Nichols' case and indicated they will
appeal Murphy's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Richard Wintory said he is concerned
about how televising Nichols' Aug. 7 preliminary hearing and other
pre-trial hearings might affect potential jurors and requested a
stay until the ruling is reviewed by higher courts. Murphy took the
request under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   Media attorney Robert Nelon praised the ruling. Court TV and
television stations in Oklahoma City and Tulsa requested a camera
in the courtroom to provide gavel-to-gavel pool coverage at
Nichols' trial and pre-trial hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Nelon said giving the presiding judge discretion to decide
whether cameras belong in a courtroom in criminal cases brings
Oklahoma in line with the majority of states in courtroom coverage
by the electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said information supplied by the National Center for
State Courts indicated that Oklahoma and Alabama are the only two
states that give defendants veto power over cameras in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial judge's discretion is still very important,'' Nelon
said. ''I think it's a good thing for the state of Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols is charged with 160 counts of first-degree murder in the
April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
He is serving a life sentence on a federal conviction of conspiracy
and involuntary manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Bush Plans Bad for Families  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore said Monday that George W.
Bush's Social Security plan would be ''bad for American families
and bad for our economy'' because retirement money would be exposed
to a fickle stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to publishers and editors at The Associated Press'
annual meeting, Gore also asserted more broadly that his Republican
presidential rival would subject the nation to ''short-term
irresponsible decisions'' on many issues, including the budget,
taxes, education, the environment and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore both were in New York to attend the funeral of
Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor. Because of the funeral, Bush
postponed plans to unveil his Social Security initiative that would
allow Americans to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the
stock market in hopes of yielding higher returns than the current
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is to address many of the same executives by
satellite Wednesday at the convention of the Newspaper Association
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to use interest savings from paying down the national
debt to shore up the Social Security system through 2054. By
raising alarms about Bush's intentions even before the Texas
governor described his plan, Gore was hoping to drive elderly and
baby boom voters away from the GOP campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's bad for American families and bad for our
economy because it takes away our ability to pay down the national
debt,'' Gore said of reports that Bush would use budget surpluses
to help make the transition to his market-orientated plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it is associated with some risk because ideas that look
very beguiling when the markets are great may not look so great if
the market turns,'' the vice president said. ''I'm not saying the
market is overvalued. I don't know; there are a lot of people who
say that. I don't happen to buy into that, but I don't know. Nobody
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett replied, ''What history has shown is
the market, over a period of time, has had a rate of return far
greater than the Social Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has long urged regular debates with Bush, called
Monday for a debate solely on the Social Security issue as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, in response, noted that Democratic senators, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both
support investment of so-called personal savings accounts for
Social Security. ''It seems Al Gore needs first to debate members
of his own party,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   While more Americans than ever are investing in the stock
market, and could be open to Bush's privatization plans, Gore's
political advisers believe the up-and-down nature of the market is
fueling anxiety among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke for about 30 minutes and took a handful of questions.
In answer to one, he said he supported the continuing review of
regulations restricting cross-ownership among newspapers and TV and
radio stations in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said the impact of estate taxes needs to
be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former newspaper reporter who followed his father into
politics, said Bush's $460 billion tax-cut plan would drive America
deeper into debt and shake the world's confidence in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we should try to have short-term irresponsible
decisions now in our national economy that would cause our country
to have to borrow heavily again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to keep the country's economy growing ''instead of
going back to the politics of drift and the economic paralysis of
the Bush-Quayle years.'' Gore is increasingly linking the Texas
governor to the economic policies of his father, former President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore was attending two fund-raisers for the Democratic
National Committee in New York that were expected to raise $1
million.

<HEADLINE> July-Like Heat, Texas to New England  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A spring heat wave sizzled from Texas to New England
on Monday,
stressing utilities as residents cranked up air conditioners for a
second and -- in some spots -- third day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The afternoon high in New York City's Central Park was 91
degrees, tying a record set in 1936. The American Red Cross handed
out bottles of water, giving out about 15,000 on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Power companies in the mid-Atlantic region urged customers to
conserve electricity as temperatures peaked above 90, well over
usual spring readings in the 70s, the National Weather Service
said.
</P>
<P>
   PJM, which coordinates the transmission of power for
mid-Atlantic utilities, asked members to urge customers to cut back
on usage, including raising the setting on air conditioners or
turning them off because of heavy demand.
</P>
<P>
   The unseasonable heat came at a time when some generating units
were down for scheduled maintenance to get ready for the summer,
said PJM spokeswoman Melissa Josef.
</P>
<P>
   Potomac Electric Power Co. forecast a peak demand Monday of
5,200 megawatts, compared with the usual 3,000 megawatts for this
time of year, spokesman Robert Dobkin said. To reduce demand, Pepco
activated its program that cycles on and off the air conditioners
of customers who volunteered for the program, in exchange for
breaks on their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. activated a similar energy
management program for 300,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in many areas issued heat stroke and air quality
warnings, with few problems reported.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in Texas first rose on Friday and reached afternoon
highs Monday of 100 in Abilene, and 99 in Mineral Wells, Wink and
San Angelo. Fort Stockton reached 98 and Midland hit 96. Monday's
readings broke no records, but that wasn't the story over the
weekend. Records were broken Saturday and Sunday in Abilene, where
the high reached 106.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would even like to go fishing, but it is too cotton pickin'
hot for that,'' said 77-year-old Ben Parker in Abilene. ''I've been
here nearly all my life ... and I don't ever recall it being like
this in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief from the heat was expected as soon as Tuesday. In Texas,
the reprieve could be a short one since temperatures were expected
to climb again Thursday, the weather service said.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be soon enough for the animals at the Cape May Country
Park &AMP; Zoo on the southern New Jersey coast. Zookeepers scurried
from enclosure to enclosure helping out their charges in 90-degree
heat.
</P>
<P>
   The goats hid under a wooden walkway, cowering from the midday
sun. Tosh, a 350-pound Bengal tiger, lolled around in the shade,
pausing only for an occasional dip in his pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''They definitely don't like the heat, especially happening this
early in the season,'' said zookeeper Sheri Hickok. ''Most of these
animals, you've got to give them a little help. ... The panda bears
hate the heat. They don't like being hosed or misted, either, so we
put ice blocks in their cages so they can rub up against them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlantic City International Airport, a 90-degree high
tied a 36-year-old record for the date, the weather service said.

<HEADLINE> Asian-American WWII Heroes Honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, is among about
20 Asian-American heroes of World War II who will receive the
United States' highest military honor next month, the White House
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Inouye led a platoon of the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental
Combat Team, which broke through German defenses in 1945 to help
end the Italian campaign. In two years of fighting, the
all-volunteer combat team and the similarly all Japanese-Amercian
volunteers 100th Infantry Battalion became the most decorated units
in U.S. military history.
</P>
<P>
   Inouye received the Distinguished Service Cross for throwing
grenades into three enemy machine gun nests in Italy. He lost his
right arm in combat, spent two years in Army hospitals and was
discharged a captain.
</P>
<P>
   He and the others to be recognized will receive Medals of Honor
at a White House ceremony June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, sponsored legislation in 1996 that
ordered a study to identify Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders
who had received the Distinguished Service Cross and recommend
those who might deserve the Medal of Honor, Akaka spokesman Paul
Cardus said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 104 names were submitted to the Army decorations board.
About 20 servicemen were recommended for upgrades, and those names
were forwarded to the secretary of the Army and then the secretary
of defense. The list was sent to the White House in December.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys Sue NY Post, Time Warner  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's parents sued the New York Post
and Time Warner for $4 million each Monday, saying they libeled the
Ramseys' son by portraying him as the prime suspect in his sister's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed in federal court in Manhattan less than
two months after it was disclosed that John and Patsy Ramsey had
settled a $25 million lawsuit against the Star, a supermarket
tabloid, for stories linking JonBenet's death to their son, Burke.
The boy was 9 at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suit claims a Post article falsely alleged that Burke
killed his sister, that he was the prime suspect in her killing and
that his representatives were ''in secret plea bargain
negotiations'' with the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also claims that a Time.com article had a headline
that libeled Burke by saying: ''Extra: Tabloid solves JonBenet
Case! -- Star magazine reports that police now think the brother did
it. Don't laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Post Publisher Ken Chandler said the Ramseys'
case was frivolous. ''We have no doubt that the Post will
prevail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Polkes, a Time Warner spokesman, said the company had no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in
the basement of her parents' home in Boulder, Colo. Boulder police
have said Burke is not a suspect, but they still regard the parents
as being under an ''umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys' lawsuits said the parents rejected the suggestion
that the son might have killed his sister in a jealous rage over
the attention she got as a child beauty queen. They said Burke was
sleeping when ''an unknown assailant brutally murdered his
6-year-old sister.''

<HEADLINE> Midwesterners Clean Up After Floods  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION, Mo. (AP) -- This is what Ed Grammer found when he returned
to his mobile home Monday: a tree trunk through one window, a
barrel stuck in another, and his brand-new sofa, dripping wet and
dangling from a hole where a wall used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm living with my parents now. I really don't know what's
going to happen,'' Grammer said. The sleeveless shirt, shorts and
mud-caked tennis shoes he wore were the only clothes he had.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't even have time to grab my wallet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen inches of rain fell in about six hours Saturday night
and Sunday morning in Union. Two people died in Union, both
motorists who got caught on flooded roads. At least a dozen others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Flat Creek, normally little more than a trickle, came to life in
a wall of water that washed away a mobile home park along its
banks. In the flood's aftermath, Grammer's home and about two dozen
other trailers were strewn about like soda cans on a littered lot.
All appeared to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Flash floods and rising rivers also caused damage in nearby
Washington, St. Clair, Cedar Hill. Damage in the region, mostly in
Franklin and Jefferson counties, was estimated at tens of millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard was called in to help sort through the mess.
Gov. Mel Carnahan declared a flood emergency, freeing up state
money to help local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''This destruction is as bad as I've ever seen,'' Carnahan said
after touring the area. ''It looks like an earthquake. The sheer
force and power of the water is almost incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts call for potentially heavy rain through Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this rain picks up again we're going to be in big trouble
because these rivers and creeks are full,'' said Tom Jensen, who
was helping to run the American Red Cross shelter set up at Union
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cleanup continued in northeastern Oklahoma after more
than 400 homes were affected by flooding over the weekend. One
woman was killed in south Tulsa when her car was trapped in rushing
water Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gov. Frank Keating declared seven counties disaster
areas, qualifying them for federal assistance if it's offered.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the rivers that eventually flow into the Mississippi
-- the Bourbeuse, the Big, the Meramec -- were expected to crest up
to 10 feet above flood stage by Tuesday. Additional rain could push
them even higher. The Meramec was already flooding ball fields,
farmland and a few businesses and homes in Missouri's St. Louis
County town of Valley Park.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed in Union and Washington. About 1,000 people
who work at plants in Washington's industrial park took Monday off
while repairs were made to flood-damaged buildings.
</P>
<P>
   No place was hit harder than Union. About 200 of the town's
6,000 residents were left homeless. Only 10 spent the night in the
Red Cross shelter. Mayor Glenn Van Leer said most stayed with
family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a trailer next to Grammer's, two women were unable to get out
before the water tore the building from its concrete pad. They
clung to a tree for five hours, water eventually reaching just
below their necks, before they were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Union residents credited police and firefighters with saving
dozens of lives. At the height of the storm shortly after midnight
Sunday, rescuers began rousting endangered people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of Grammer's, Don Vest, had seen enough. Vest, 67,
lived on slightly higher ground so the inside of his trailer was
not badly damaged. Still, he was loading up a pickup truck with his
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm moving out,'' Vest said. ''I never would have believed
this until I saw it. And I don't want to ever see it again. I was
scared to death.''

<HEADLINE> Little differences between four Republican Senate hopefuls indebate  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- From gun control to health insurance to
trade with China, the four Republicans were pretty much in
agreement. The only thing they disagreed on was who should be New
Jersey's newest U.S. Senator.
</P>
<P>
   The four candidates met in their first debate Monday in a forum
that allowed little back-and-forth between them.
</P>
<P>
   What brief invective there was in the hour-long exchange was
reserved for Democratic targets: Jim Florio's tax increase and Jon
Corzine's $300 million bankroll. The candidates met in the studios
of New Jersey Network and answered reporters' questions. The debate
was sponsored by NJN and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, state Sen. William L. Gormley, R-Atlantic, said
he was the one who led the Republican charge against Florio when
the former governor raised the state sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted against every one of Jim Florio's tax hikes,'' said
Gormley, who then boasted that he and other Republican state
leaders ''cut taxes 37 times.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the party that took on Jim Florio. We cut his taxes. We
balanced his budgets,'' Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger said he knows ''2.8
billion reasons'' not to vote for Florio, another reference to the
tax increase that helped limit him to one term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Union, cited his experience with
''fiscal discipline'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the only candidate in this race who took on the
tax-and-spend liberals in Washington,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   And even renegade Republican Murray Sabrin, a Ramapo College
professor, denounced Florio's tax increases. Sabrin then went on to
denounce all tax increases and said if elected he would support
''major tax cuts,'' the elimination of the capital gains tax, the
inheritance tax as well as the federal Department of Energy and the
department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   However conservative he sounded there, Sabrin was right in line
with the other three on some issues, including health care.
</P>
<P>
   All candidates said they favored some form of medical savings
account and tax breaks to help people shoulder the cost of medical
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''More mandates from Washington, D.C. isn't the answer,'' said
Franks, who proposed ''incentives'' for small business.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger also backed tax breaks for medical insurance
payments, saying it would ''give every family, every individual the
freedom and the opportunity to get tax credits.''
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, Gormley offered his record ''of standing up to
the NRA'' in a state vote to ban assault weapons. He said he favors
monitoring of sales at gun shows and wants more money to research
''smart guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to see tough penalties and I want to see the penalties
on the books enforced,'' Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, too, wanted background checks at guns shows and a ban on
high-capacity ammunition clips. Treffinger said he wants penalties
for ''crimes with a handgun to go up appreciably.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin, on the other hand, opposes gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, Gormley and Treffinger also favored campaign finance
reforms, saying the federal government needs to do more than ban
soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger said he would ''abolish all PACs once and for all,''
while Gormley promised ''full disclosure, we need an end to soft
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Sabrin opposed, saying campaign limits violate individuals
rights to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Florio and Corzine are scheduled to meet in a debate again
sponsored by New Jersey Network and the New York Times.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Baseball Player Found in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Cuban college baseball player missing since the
weekend surfaced in South Florida on Monday and declared that he
wants to defect to the United States, a sports agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Miguel Chaoui will apply for asylum and wants to
eventually play professional baseball, said Joe Cubas, an agent who
has helped other Cuban ballplayers after they fled the communist
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''He basically jumped in the car of a family member Saturday
night and arrived in Miami yesterday,'' Cubas said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaoui's family contacted Cubas for advice, but Cubas is not
representing the player. Chaoui wants to attend college here and
play baseball for his school, Cubas said. He would not be able to
play college baseball if he was represented by an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Chaoui was last seen getting into a waiting car at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Saturday afternoon,
shortly after his team arrived to return last winter's visit by the
University of St. Thomas baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Chaoui's team, Equipo Caribe, or Team Caribbean, is made up
mostly of students from the University of Havana and some students
from a technical institute in the Cuban capital. His abrupt
departure took teammates by surprise; some labeled him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis Dease, the president of St. Thomas, said school
officials made sure none of the St. Thomas players was harboring
Chaoui. He said that the players were all surprised to learn of his
disappearance and that several St. Thomas players had been
corresponding with him since their trip to Cuba in January.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Cuban team of college players came to the United
States was in 1987, when a national team played several games in
Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Senator Clarifies Elian Comments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. (AP) -- A U.S. senator said Monday that remarks he
made about Elian Gonzalez and tranquilizers were not meant to
suggest the boy is being drugged to make him more amenable to
returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith was quoted by The Union Leader of Manchester as
saying at a town hall meeting Sunday: ''They've already found
tranquilizer drugs with the doctors. I think you can reasonably
assume that on May 11 the little kid is going to come say, 'I want
to go back to Cuba.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, R-N.H., told The Associated Press on Monday the newspaper
quoted him accurately. But he said it left out other reasons he
cited for his prediction that Elian will say he wants to go home --
being surrounded by Cuban officials and playmates and not having
access to people with other viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he does not believe Elian is being drugged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not suggest it. If that's the conclusion you draw,
that's incorrect,'' Smith said in a telephone interview from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is concerned that drugs including tranquilizers were
taken by U.S. officials from Elian's Cuban pediatrician when she
arrived for a visit late last month. And he said he is concerned
the boy is living at what amounts to a Cuban re-education camp at a
private conference center in eastern Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Smith described the compound Sunday as ''a concentration camp,''
according to The Union Leader. Smith said Monday if he used that
term, he misspoke. He said he has consistently described the
compound as ''a re-education camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, whose mother drowned in November during their escape from
Cuba, is living with his father in Maryland while he waits for U.S.
courts to decide his future. A hearing on an asylum request is
scheduled for Thursday in Atlanta, although it's unlikely that
Elian and his father would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's pediatrician, Dr. Caridad Ponce de Leon, was with a
group of Cubans who flew to the United States on April 27 to spend
time with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state television reported that U.S. Customs agents took
medicines including tranquilizers from her upon her arrival at
Dulles International Airport. Authorities said Ponce de Leon is not
licensed to practice in Maryland and that the medications would be
returned to her when she leaves the country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said the medicines were part of the doctor's
regular medical kit, and they had no information about what she
intended to do with them.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmer Resolution Draws Ire  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House resolution urging the federal
government to speed up settlement payments to black farmers in a
discrimination lawsuit was defeated Monday after coming up against
the unlikeliest of opponents: black congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The non-binding resolution, requiring a two-thirds majority
under a special House procedure, fell on a 216-180 vote with the
Congressional Black Caucus leading 179 Democrats and one
independent in opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Black lawmakers accused the measure's sponsor, Rep. Jay Dickey,
R-Ark., of playing politics and trying to curry favor with blacks
for his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   The other sponsor was Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the only black
Republican in Congress and chair of the House Republican
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Black Caucus members said Dickey was absent during efforts to
reach last year's landmark settlement with the Agriculture
Department. Adding to their ire, they say, is a resolution that
does little.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the surface this legislation seems to help the black
farmers who have been forced into near extinction,'' said Caucus
Chairman James Clyburn of South Carolina. ''Once you get past the
smoke and mirrors, this resolution does nothing . . . The
Congressional Black Caucus cannot, in good faith, support this
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., ''I could be wrong but I
don't remember Jay Dickey's participation in any of these events.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey responded saying he has been active in black farmers'
issues since he first came to Congress in 1993. ''I was doing this
because it was right, not because I expect anything politically
back from it. If they've got an alternative solution I'll get
behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What are they offering?'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department last year reached a settlement that
is expected to spend millions of dollars paying black farmers who
had complained that they were systematically discriminated against
when applying for loans and subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18,000 farmers filed claims under the settlement. Some
7,329 cases have been approved so far, and payments of $50,000 each
have been made to 3,594 of those, according to a USDA report last
month. Another 4,742 claims have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey angered black farmers in his district in January when,
after being approached by a group of farmers for help in getting
their settlement payments, he told them it would be difficult to
support them when they refused to support him politically.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Democratic Party denounced the comments as a
''shakedown'' and Dickey later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Dickey, a four-term representative from heavily
Democratic southern Arkansas, has only stepped forward now to gain
political favor during his re-election. Four Democrats are vying
for the seat, including former state Rep. Judy Smith, who received
42 percent against Dickey in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With 27 percent of its electorate black, Dickey's district has
Arkansas' largest black voter population. Dickey was the first
Republican elected to the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Grant, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturists
Association, said he supports the legislation but farmers ''just
don't need people speaking two languages. We won't be played in
this political game.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton isn't completely alone at
night when first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton sleeps at their home
in New York. Buddy, the president's playful chocolate Labrador,
sometimes curls up next to him.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Civil Servant Gives Smithsonian $2M  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A civil servant has donated $2 million to the
Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, the largest
single donation in the gallery's history, Smithsonian officials
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The donation from Paul Peck, a computer systems manager at the
U.S. Customs Service, is to finance a multimedia program at the
National Portrait Gallery to focus on the American presidency as an
adjunct to the gallery's Hall of Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I walk through the Hall of Presidents, I feel
shivers,'' said Peck, who built his fortune through an off-duty
consulting sideline on information technology, real estate and
financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Peck's gift will support the maintenance and improvements at the
gallery and its collections and sponsor activities ranging from
lectures, dramas and musicals to radio, television and Internet
programs about the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of his gift, the National Portrait Gallery will name a
space after Peck when it reopens after renovations in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Peck began giving away his money in 1992 with the foundation of
a D.C.-area scholarship program and establishment of a humanities
institute at Montgomery College in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a little luck,'' said Peck, ''when I die, I will have
given everything away.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Portrait Gallery also announced Monday that it is
sending on loan about 1,000 works to museums and other institutions
across the United States, Europe and Japan while its home, the Old
Patent Office Building, is closed for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   In other Smithsonian news, former Washington Post Co. president
Alan Spoon was named a member of the Smithsonian's board of
regents. Spoon, 48, is currently a partner with Polaris Venture
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The regents also reappointed Manuel Ibanez, a biochemist and
professor at Texas A&AMP;M University in Kingsville, Texas, to the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Both men will serve six year terms.

<HEADLINE> Rules for Jersey shore development still in dispute  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Rules that are supposed to curb development
at the Jersey shore are in dispute -- again.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Policy and Regulatory Oversight committee narrowly
approved a resolution Monday that says the rules carrying out the
Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA) violate the intent of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules, which were adopted by the state Department of
Environmental Protection in February, took six years and several
trips to court to be put in place.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody likes them.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the rules don't go far enough and will
actually prompt more development at the shore. Shore-area lawmakers
say they go too far by outlawing any development in beach towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happened here is that the rules and regulations that
are now in force severely restrict future development in the
coastal regions,'' said Assemblyman Ken LeFevre, R-Atlantic, a
resolution sponsor. ''They're trying to restrict development to the
point where there is going to be no development, and I don't think
that that was the intent of the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the rules allow too much development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is that, indeed, the regulations need to be a
great deal stronger,'' said Dery Bennett, executive director of the
American Littoral Society, a shore protection group.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said lawmakers intended for the state to force shore
towns to abide by the state master plan, which is supposed to guide
development in all towns. The rules fall short of doing that,
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution still has to pass both legislative houses. If
that happens, then Department of Environmental Protection
Commissioner Bob Shinn would have 30 days to review the rules and
make changes. If he fails to do that, the Legislature can pass
another resolution that declares them void.
</P>
<P>
   The governor does not have to sign off on the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The CAFRA rules were supposed to be adopted in 1994. The process
stalled as developers and environmental groups tangled over what
should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists in 1998 charged in court that the state was
dragging its feet while developers were gobbling up sensitive shore
land. A state Superior Court judge set a timetable for the state to
act, and officials pledged to have rules in place.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the rules make it easier for developers to
build in targeted areas that are already developed -- and much more
difficult for them to build in undeveloped, environmentally
sensitive areas.

<HEADLINE> Ex-SEC Officials Establish Society  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three ex-officials of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, including former chairman David Ruder, have
established a new historical society for the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society will
sponsor policy conferences, support research on issues related to
securities law and maintain archives of important papers of SEC
commissioners, the market watchdog agency announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gaining a better understanding of how our markets have
evolved, and the SEC's role in maintaining the integrity of those
markets, is vital to analyzing current market developments and
transitions today,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The society was established by Ruder; Paul Gonson, a former SEC
solicitor; and Harvey Pitt, a former general counsel of the agency,
which regulates the nation's securities markets, mutual funds and
investment companies. The SEC was created by Congress in 1934 in
response to the stock market crash of October 1929.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Appointed for Farms Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization on Monday appointed
Peruvian trade diplomat Jorge Voto-Bernales to head negotiations
aimed at opening agriculture markets, ending months of deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been stuck because the European Union and the
18-nation Cairns group refused to accept each other's candidates.
Agriculture is the most divisive issue at the WTO and disagreements
over it played a major part in the collapse of the body's
ministerial meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am just grateful and pleased we have got people in place who
want to do a job,'' WTO Director-General Mike Moore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Voto-Bernales, appointed to head the WTO's agriculture
committee, will oversee the talks, aimed at liberalizing markets
and improving access for member nations to each other's markets.
</P>
<P>
   The council also appointed Yoichi Suzuki of Japan as
vice-chairman. He is expected to chair normal committee meetings
but not the separate negotiating sessions. Japan supports the EU
over agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairns Group, which includes Australia, Brazil and Canada
and is supported by the United States, says agriculture should be
treated like any other item which is traded between countries. It
is calling on the European Union to remove its heavy subsidy
program on the grounds that this distorts trade.
</P>
<P>
   The EU, which devotes around half its total budget to
agriculture subsidies, says that food production is special and
discussions on opening markets should also consider issues such as
food security, protection of rural communities and animal welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO has been committed to starting talks on agriculture this
year since well before the Seattle debacle, but the 136 members
were unable to agree what should be included in the package.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was forced to appoint an interim chair for the first
meeting of the agriculture committee in March, but pushed for a
quick permanent appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Peru is not a member of the Cairns Group, so Voto-Bernales was
considered more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also appointed Ambassador Chak Mun-See of Singapore
to chair the council for trade-related aspects of intellectual
property rights.

<HEADLINE> Six die when air conditioner recycles carbon monoxide  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo pursuing
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSLYN HEIGHTS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Long Island doctor, annoyed by
buzzing from a carbon monoxide detector for no apparent reason,
disabled the device. Later he returned from work to find six
people, including a 2-year-old daughter, dead inside his home,
killed by carbon monoxide sucked in by an air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Dr. Andrei Kranz was sitting on his lawn crying
at 9:45 a.m. Sunday, after returning home from an overnight
hospital shift to find his young daughter, his parents, two family
friends and a baby sitter dead.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz had carried the body of his daughter out of the house in a
vain attempt to revive her, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in shock,'' said neighbor Debbi Annunziata. ''He was
hysterical. He was crying and making noises.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife and 17-year-old step-daughter were visiting relatives
in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz told police he had disconnected the carbon-monoxide alarm
because it buzzed repeatedly and he thought it was malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Police said both the air conditioner and home's furnace were on.
One of the air conditioner's intake vents was closed and another
was clogged with leaves, meaning it could draw air only from the
room it shared with the natural-gas furnace, causing it to recycle
carbon monoxide, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were pronounced dead around 10 a.m. They were
identified as Victoria Kranz, 74, and Marcus Kranz, 85, Kranz's
parents who lived in Rosyln Heights; Simina Kranz, 2, Kranz's
daughter; houseguests Emil Ioan Campeanu, 75, and his wife, Maria
Mihaela Campeanu, 68, and the family baby sitter, Emilia Dumtru,
58.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors and the baby sitter were from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz, a radiology resident at Nassau County Medical Center, was
being treated at his hospital's intensive care for exposure to
carbon monoxide. He was in stable condition early Monday afternoon
and was expected to be released later in the day, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating. Foul play had been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could have all been so easily avoided,'' neighbor Donna
Bernstein said after learning that the detector had been turned
off.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the death of tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis, killed
when his Long Island cottage was filled with carbon monoxide from a
swimming pool heater in 1994.

Royals-Tigers
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Mac Suzuki will return to the Royals' rotation
Tuesday. The 6-foot-3, 205-pounder from Kobe, Japan, began the
season in the rotation but was demoted to the bullpen after
compiling a 5.40 ERA, allowing eight earned runs in 13 1-3 innings.
In his last three appearances, all in relief, he allowed two earned
runs in 11 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Damion Easley, who has been playing with a chipped bone
in his right wrist, was on the bench Monday night for the opening
of a three-game series with Kansas City and likely headed for the
disabled list. ''It's to the point where it's hard to deal with,''
Easley said. ''Every time I swing, I have to step out and gather
myself, but the pain never goes away completely.'' Easley said he
likely will be placed on the 15-day DL, perhaps on Tuesday.
Orioles-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles held a team meeting before the game. ...
Baltimore entered having lost 10 straight games to Toronto, and 11
in a row at SkyDome. ... 2B Delino DeShields refuses to speak to
the media. Albert Belle also doesn't talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Jose Cruz Jr. was the American League player of the
week. Cruz hit .387 with five home runs and nine RBIs. ... Andy
Thompson's wife Christine gave birth to a girl on Sunday. Thompson,
who made his major league debut last week, left the team to be with
his wife in Wisconsin. ... The Blue Jays are on pace to hit 207
home runs at SkyDome this season. The club record at home is 112 in
1998.
Devil Rays-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Closer Roberto Hernandez will likely miss 2-3 days
with a bruised right elbow after getting hit in his pitching arm by
a line drive from Nomar Garciaparra on Sunday. ... RHP Juan Guzman
threw off the mound for the first time since going on the DL with a
sore shoulder. LHP Wilson Alvarez, who is also on the DL, threw as
well in Florida. Neither pitcher is expected back until early June.
When they do return, manager Larry Rothschild will have the
opportunity to demote two starters to the bullpen or the minors.
He'll have many choices as Tampa Bay's rotation was 6-12 with a
6.88 ERA entering the game. ''The opportunity is there. Whoever
takes advantage of it will still be here. Whoever doesn't, won't.''
... Dwight Gooden, making his first appearance as a visitor in New
York, faced the Yankees once during the 1998 ALCS for Cleveland. He
allowed three runs in 4 2-3 innings and lost 4-0 in Game 4. The
only teams Gooden hasn't faced are Arizona and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 2B Chuck Knoblauch took infield and batting practice
but it is uncertain when he will return from his sore left wrist.
Knoblauch has missed the last six games. ''When we have Knobby at
the top of the lineup, it really makes the other pitcher work. He's
a tough out,'' manager Joe Torre said. ... Mariano Rivera's blown
save Sunday was the first time he blew a game when ahead by at
least two runs in the ninth inning or later since Aug. 2, 1996,
against Kansas City. ''You can expect him to do his job every day,
but it's not going to happen,'' Torre said. ... The Yankees-Rangers
game that was rained out April 12 will be replayed on Aug. 21 at
12:05 p.m. EDT. ... LHP Ed Yarnall was placed on the DL at Columbus
with back soreness.
White Sox-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: LHP Jim Parque began his three-game suspension for his
role in an on-field brawl April 22 against Detroit. The other six
White Sox suspended already have completed serving their penalties.
Chicago was 3-6 in the first nine games after the suspensions were
announced April 27. In the nine games before that, the White Sox
were 8-1. ... The White Sox offense has quieted down since they
scored 181 runs in April (an average of 7.2 per game), breaking the
major-league record for the month of 180 set by Texas in 1998. In
their first six games in May, they had 25 runs (an average of
4.17). ... Chicago opened a tough 18-game stretch in which they
play 11 times against Boston, Cleveland and the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Only four players walked in the previous four games
against the Red Sox. And Brian Rose started Monday's game by not
issuing any walks in the first three innings. ... Trot Nixon made
it 21 games of the 24 he's played in which he reached base when he
singled in the first. ... Nomar Garciaparra and Troy O'Leary are
neck-and-neck in their race to 100 career homers. They were tied at
98 after O'Leary hit his fifth homer of the season Sunday.
Garciaparra had just two homers in his first 25 games after hitting
27 in 135 games last year.
Mariners-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners are playing at The Ballpark in Arlington
for the first time without Ken Griffey Jr., whose .382 average
there is his best in any stadium in the major leagues. During his
11 seasons in Seattle before going to Cincinnati this spring,
Griffey hit .315 with 30 home runs and 101 RBIs in all games vs.
Texas. Only against Toronto (.317) does he have a better average.
... P Brett Tomko, acquired from the Reds in the Griffey deal, made
his 11th career start against an AL team on Monday, the first
against an AL opponent not in the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Despite a strained hip flexor, David Segui started at
first base for the third straight game Monday while Rafael
Palmeiro, with his strained hamstring, remained the designated
hitter. Manager Johnny Oates said Segui can play based on how he
feels since the injury really can't be aggravated any worse, but he
says he won't give Palmeiro a chance to play first base again
''until his leg is 100 percent, or as close at it's going to get.''
... OF Rusty Greer, on the disabled list since April 13, took
batting practice again Monday. Oates said he is still not sure when
Greer will return to the lineup, but said it would be at least
another week. Greer originally went on the DL for the first time in
his career due to a strained left hamstring and an ankle problem,
but then decided to have arthroscopic surgery to remove bones spurs
from his right ankle.
Indians-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Bench coach Grady Little, who's filling in while
manager Charlie Manuel recovers from colon surgery, said Kenny
Lofton (strained left biceps) is improving: ''He's still getting
himself ready. All of his physical activities have been very
positive and he's got a big smile on his face. So, a lot of times,
that tells you how a kid's feeling. ... The Indians activated C
Sandy Alomar (hamstring) from the 15-day DL and designated C Bobby
Hughes for assignment. Hughes signed on April 20 but didn't appear
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins honored manager Tom Kelly before the game.
Kelly became the 46th manager in major league history to win 1,000
games with the Twins' 4-0 victory over Detroit on Sunday. Kelly is
the sixth manager to win 1,000 games with one team. The
longest-tenured coach or manager in professional sports received
donations in his name to several charities during pre-game
festivities that included congratulatory messages from several
other managers on the big screen scoreboard. Kelly was presented
with a Twins jersey No. 1,000.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Braves-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: First baseman Randall Simon, who batted .317 in 90
games for Atlanta last season, was released by the Marlins'
Triple-A affiliate in Calgary. ... Braves second baseman Quilvio
Veras, who left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the fourth
inning because of a sore right wrist, was back in the lineup
Monday. ... Atlanta's pitching staff leads the National League in
ERA and has allowed the fewest homers and thrown the fewest wild
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Florida's Ricky Bones, who will take Alex Fernandez's
turn in the rotation Thursday against Atlanta, began the week with
an 0.44 ERA in 20 1-3 innings.
Brewers-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The wind was blowing out at Wrigley Field again
Monday night, and that was good news for the Brewers. Opponents
have hit 11 home runs in seven games when the wind was blowing out
so far this season. Manager Davey Lopes knows all about the Wrigley
Field wind after playing for the Cubs from 1984-86. ''Hitters love
to have the wind blowing out, pitchers hate it,'' Lopes said. ''You
don't necessarily have to have a power-hitting team to take
advantage of the wind here. You just have to get it up in the
air.'' ... With Geoff Jenkins out for a month with a broken finger,
Lopes plans to rotate Lyle Mouton and James Mouton in left field.
Lyle was in left Monday night. ''Depending on the pitcher,
depending on who's the one who gets hot,'' Lopes said. ''If one guy
gets hot, he'll play.'' ... Sammy Sosa has hit 18 home runs off
Milwaukee pitchers in the last two seasons, including No's. 60 and
61 in 1998. ''Sammy's going to get his no matter what,'' Lopes
said. ''It's like trying to shut down Michael Jordan -- you try to
minimize the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs released RHP Bobby Ayala from his minor league
contract and signed RHP Tim Worrell to a contract with the Triple-A
Iowa Cubs. Worrell was released by the Baltimore Orioles on May 1
after going 2-2 with a 7.36 ERA in five relief appearances. ''The
more he pitched, from the reports I got, his velocity varied up and
down. Then his numbers started to go up slightly,'' manager Don
Baylor said. ''Worrell we tried to sign right before spring
training.'' ... Eric Young was supposed to get Monday night off,
but he's playing too well. He's got a five-game hitting streak,
hitting .476 with three doubles, two homers and four RBIs during
the stretch. ''I just can't afford to take him out,'' Baylor said.
''He's a catalyst for us at the top of the lineup, he's exciting to
watch. Plus, he makes our offense go.'' So, when will Young get a
day off? ''He'll have to come to me, because I'm not going to
him,'' Baylor said, laughing. ... With a four-game losing streak
and the second-worst record in the NL, times are tough for the
Cubs. Baylor meets with his coaches every day trying to find ways
to give the team a spark. But the veteran players, who endured last
year's 67-95 record, might be taking it the hardest. ''Until we get
back to .500, I believe there's a sense of urgency for the guys
that were here last year,'' Baylor said. ''It's like, 'Oh, no, not
again. Here we go falling into this black hole again.' I'd like to
start climbing back and try to get closer to .500. Now that we have
(Ismael) Valdes and (Kerry) Wood back in the starting rotation, we
have to get better with those two guys. There's no doubt about
it.''
Rockies-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Despite Sunday's rainout in San Francisco, the one
thing the Rockies didn't want to do was disrupt Pedro Astacio's
spot in the rotation. He was on the mound to start Monday night
against the Astros. ''What we do know is we want to keep Pedro on
his turn,'' manager Buddy Bell said. ''He's the No. 1 guy. We want
to get him out there as much as possible.'' Scott Karl, scheduled
to start on Sunday, will now start Tuesday against the Astros.
''That's why you number your starters,'' Karl said. ''You want the
No. 1 guy to stay on course as much as possible. There's nothing
you can do about the schedule, except adjust.'' ... CF Tom Goodwin
returned to the lineup after missing two games with a strained leg
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Perennial leadoff hitter Craig Biggio and No. 2 hitter
Roger Cedeno were flip-flopped in Monday night's lineup by Astros
manager Larry Dierker. ''If Cedeno gets on he can steal at any
juncture,'' Dierker said. ''Biggio has to pick his spots. Cedeno
could steal more bases if he leads off.'' Cedeno entered the game,
leading the NL with 10 stolen bases. ... The Astros skipped batting
practice Monday after completing a 5-5 road trip for a 9-9 season
record on the road. They entered Monday's game with a 3-9 record at
Enron Field.

<HEADLINE> Former Boy Scout who told the world about AIDS dies in crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Henry J. Nicols, an AIDS activist and
Boy Scout who gained the world's attention after announcing that he
was HIV postive, died Monday from injuries received in a car crash.
He was 26.
</P>
<P>
   Nicols was hospitalized in critical condition after his car
struck a tree last month on county Route 31 in Springfield, Otsego
County Sheriff's Investigator Richard Devlin Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Devlin, Nicols was traveling north in his Pontiac
Fiero when he drove onto the right-hand shoulder, briefly returned
to his lane and then crossed the opposite lane and hit a tree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Nicols launched an Eagle Scout project that grew into a
worldwide education campaign to dispel ignorance and stereotypes
surrounding AIDS. Nicols, a hemophiliac, contracted the HIV virus
during a blood transfusion in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our grief at Henry's untimely death is lessened by the
knowledge that during his life he touched the hearts of millions,''
said the Nichols family in a statement released by Bassett Health
Care.
</P>
<P>
   His activism took him to Ireland and Japan and landed him an
audience with Presidents Bush and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He testified before a congressional committee studying whether
AIDS testing for health-care workers should be mandatory and was
the subject of an award-winning documentary.

<HEADLINE> Biker Trial Begins in Finland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- A murder trial against three motorcycle
gang members opened Monday amid tight security in a bomb shelter in
southern Finland because officials feared reprisal attacks by rival
bikers.
</P>
<P>
   The three men, of the Canonballs gang, were charged with murder
for killing three rival gang members and wounding two others in a
January shootout during a break from a court hearing in Lahti, 60
miles north of Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth man was charged with assisting in the pizzeria
shootings in which two outsiders also were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   All four men, who were not named under Finnish law, denied the
charges Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Chief Superintendent Martti Hirvonen of the Lahti
police said the courthouse was not safe enough to try the bikers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt it was safer to hold the hearing in the air raid
shelter,'' Hirvonen said. ''There's no doubt, there have been
threats. After all, we are dealing with bikers.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to give further details of the hearing or security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Police fear the Jan. 18 shootings could re-ignite a feud between
rival bikers in the Nordic countries in which at least 15 people
have been killed and 75 injured since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, no attacks were reported until the
Lahti incident in which Bjorn Isaksson, 35, chairman of the
Bandidos gang and member Sakke Pirra, 31, were gunned down. Also,
Juha Jalonen, 34, a member of the Black Rhino biker gang was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (bikers) have a sort of revenge mentality in their
culture, so that if someone strikes at them they will, sooner or
later, strike back,'' Detective Chief Inspector Rabbe von Hertzen
of the National Bureau of Investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   If the three accused bikers are found guilty, they face up to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to last four days.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Adviser Is Persona Non Grata  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The Haitian government declared a
prominent international elections adviser persona non grata,
casting further doubt over the country's troubled election process,
a radio station reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Micheline Begin, head of the Haiti office of the
Washington-based International Foundation for Election Systems,
left Haiti before the government could expel her, Premier
Jacques-Edouard Alexis said in an interview broadcast by private
Radio Kiskeya.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis said Begin had reported to her group's Washington
headquarters that President Rene Preval was unduly influenced by
advisers loyal to the party of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, Preval's mentor and predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't tolerate this sort of declaration from a foreigner,''
said Alexis, who called it ''an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   IFES confirmed Begin was no longer in Haiti but declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In February, IFES stirred up criticism in Haiti when it said
that voter registration difficulties could postpone elections.
</P>
<P>
   After much discussion, two rounds of local and legislative
elections were rescheduled from March to May 21 and June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader and former Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul
denounced the move to push out Begin, saying the government had
''blinded the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In this climate, I don't see how credible, democratic
balloting can take place this month,'' said Paul, who charged
Aristide partisans of controlling the computer division of the
electoral council.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodshed and vandalism have marred the preparations for
elections and halted most campaigning, dampening the enthusiasm of
more than 4 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, gunmen killed Elam Senat, a well-known
opposition militant in the town of Savanette, and his 23-year-old
son, Edner, Paul said. In the Port-au-Prince, arsonists torched the
home of legislature candidate Jeremie Joachim.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people have been killed in politically related slayings
since March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide party spokesmen have denied responsibility for
political violence.

<HEADLINE> Perot May Not Address Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party founder Ross Perot is not
expected to address the party's August convention, where former
Republican Pat Buchanan is likely to become the third party's
nominee for president, officials close to the event said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a very tight travel schedule for business this summer
and no definite plans have been made one way or the other with
respect to appearing at the convention,'' Perot's top lieutenant,
Russell Verney, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But senior party officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Perot has indicated he will not attend the convention or make
a statement in support of the nominee, which would be a first since
he founded the party in 1992. His absence could further demoralize
a party riven by fierce infighting for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's campaign manager and sister, Bay, said they would
welcome Perot at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has decided throghout this process to remain neutral and we
respect that,'' she said. ''If he chooses to attend the convention
and speak we will be thrilled, and if he chooses not to, we'll
respect that decision too.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has never figured the Texas billionaire into his plans
for capturing the presidential nomination, anyway. For his part,
Perot never warmed to the conservative commentator. Shortly after
Buchanan bolted the GOP last year, Perot rejected his proposal for
a telephone conversation but sent word that he welcomed him into
the party like anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Buchanan has clashed with Perot supporters in
several states over everything from the way he is pursuing delegate
votes to his positions on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday in Perot's home state, Buchanan
referred to it as ''my convention'' even as he acknowledged that
his presence in the party has inspired unprecedented upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to be at my convention, the Reform Party
convention, and get nominated and then have some (states) say,
'Rather than put him on our ballot, we are going to disaffiliate'
then you're not on the ballot,'' Buchanan said. Instead of being
blocked out of those delegations, Buchanan has acquired enough
signatures to get on the ballot in those states as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for example, Buchanan announced Monday that he has
submitted 129,000 signatures, more than twice the number required,
to get on the ballot as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has left a trail of outraged Perot supporters in his
pursuit of convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his opposition to abortion and views on other social
issues clash sharply with the principles on which Perot founded the
party, Buchanan says common ground exists on trade and other
foreign policy. Both he and the party oppose free trade agreements,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform is silent on social issues like homosexuality
and abortion because it does not believe government should weigh in
on such private matters.
</P>
<P>
   Verney declined to say whether Buchanan's statements inspired
Perot to stay away from the convention. But he did issue a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''If social issues start to become the focal point of the
campaign and the members feel that that does not represent their
goals and ambitions, you're going to get some growing problems,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That dustup is the most recent between Buchanan and Perot's
supporters. A string of state parties have made known that they'd
rather follow the Minnesota Reform Party -- and disaffiliate from
the national organization -- rather than accept Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem for Buchanan is the abrupt resignation
of chairman Pat Choate, who was Perot's running mate in 1996 and
Buchanan's campaign chairman earlier this year. Citing a serious
family illness, Choate on Friday turned the chairmanship over to
vice chairman Gerry Moan, who has been neutral in the disputes
between the Buchanan and Perot camps.
</P>
<P>
   Moan, a 52-year-old Tucson, Ariz. business executive, said he
believes the party can be unified.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see the relationship between the party and the campaigns as
a partnership,'' Moan said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Sign Worrell, Release Ayala  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs signed right-handed pitcher Tim
Worrell to a minor league contract Monday and released reliever
Bobby Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell, 32, was released by the Baltimore Orioles on May 1.
He'd been designated for assignment to make room for infielder Mark
Lewis, who was claimed from Cincinnati. Worrell was 2-2 with a 7.36
ERA in five relief appearances for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell is 22-34 with four saves and a 4.50 ERA in 244 games
with San Diego, Detroit, Cleveland, Oakland and Baltimore. He's
expected to join Triple-A Iowa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who spent the final month of the 1999 season with the
Cubs, signed a minor league contract April 4. He went 1-2 with a
4.61 ERA in 10 games for Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more he pitched, from the reports I got, his velocity
varied up and down. Then his numbers started to go up slightly,''
Cubs manager Don Baylor said. ''Worrell we tried to sign right
before spring training.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Bashes Bush Retirement Plan  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore said Monday that George W.
Bush's Social Security plan would be ''bad for American families
and bad for our economy'' because retirement money would be exposed
to a fickle stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to publishers and editors at The Associated Press'
annual meeting, Gore also asserted more broadly that his Republican
presidential rival would subject the nation to ''short-term
irresponsible decisions'' on many issues, including the budget,
taxes, education, the environment and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore both were in New York to attend the funeral of
Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor. Because of the funeral, Bush
postponed plans to unveil his Social Security initiative that would
allow Americans to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the
stock market in hopes of yielding higher returns than the current
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is to address many of the same executives by
satellite Wednesday at the convention of the Newspaper Association
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to use interest savings from paying down the national
debt to shore up the Social Security system through 2054. By
raising alarms about Bush's intentions even before the Texas
governor described his plan, Gore was hoping to drive elderly and
baby boom voters away from the GOP campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's bad for American families and bad for our
economy because it takes away our ability to pay down the national
debt,'' Gore said of reports that Bush would use budget surpluses
to help make the transition to his market-orientated plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it is associated with some risk because ideas that look
very beguiling when the markets are great may not look so great if
the market turns,'' the vice president said. ''I'm not saying the
market is overvalued. I don't know; there are a lot of people who
say that. I don't happen to buy into that, but I don't know. Nobody
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett replied, ''What history has shown is
the market, over a period of time, has had a rate of return far
greater than the Social Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has long urged regular debates with Bush, called
Monday for a debate solely on the Social Security issue as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, in response, noted that Democratic senators, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both
support investment of so-called personal savings accounts for
Social Security. ''It seems Al Gore needs first to debate members
of his own party,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   While more Americans than ever are investing in the stock
market, and could be open to Bush's privatization plans, Gore's
political advisers believe the up-and-down nature of the market is
fueling anxiety among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke for about 30 minutes and took a handful of questions.
In answer to one, he said he supported the continuing review of
regulations restricting cross-ownership among newspapers and TV and
radio stations in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said the impact of estate taxes needs to
be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a former newspaper reporter who followed his father into
politics, said Bush's $460 billion tax-cut plan would drive America
deeper into debt and shake the world's confidence in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we should try to have short-term irresponsible
decisions now in our national economy that would cause our country
to have to borrow heavily again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to keep the country's economy growing ''instead of
going back to the politics of drift and the economic paralysis of
the Bush-Quayle years.'' Gore is increasingly linking the Texas
governor to the economic policies of his father, former President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore attended two fund-raisers for the Democratic
National Committee in New York that were expected to raise $1
million. At one, he acknowledged that Bush's tax plan might benefit
some of those in attendance, but said it would be bad for the
nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   He called it ''a $2.3 trillion tax scheme that would put us
right back in debt.''

<HEADLINE> German Cos. Warned of US Boycott  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German companies who fail to fund compensation for
Nazi-era forced and slave laborers could risk having their products
boycotted in the United States, a German official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The warning by Otto Lambsdorff, Germany's chief negotiator in
talks on a settlement, was part of the growing pressure on
companies that benefited from the forced labor to quit stalling on
the planned $4.6 billion fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we really don't get the payments that were promised, there
will be considerable boycotts and sanctions against German
companies, particularly in the United States,'' Lambsdorff told
Berlin's InfoRadio station.
</P>
<P>
   German industry agreed last December to contribute half the
total, with the government to pay the other half. But the fund says
companies have so far contributed only $1.3 billion -- just over
half their share.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse, the country's
second-highest public official, warned of a ''disgrace for
Germany'' if the compensation drive collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   And German President Johannes Rau also repeated his call on
German industry to fully participate in the compensation effort
Monday, the 55th anniversary of Germany's capitulation in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   ''The compensation must now finally take place,'' he said in
Berlin. ''Therefore I appeal once more to German industry: Accept
your responsibility. We owe it to the victims, and that is in the
German interest.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Germany also is trying to win U.S.
government support for shielding German firms against future claims
and lawsuits by victims.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff voiced confidence that industry will ultimately find
the money and that payments to the aging survivors -- a
long-forgotten group of Nazi victims -- will start this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thierse appealed to industry to show a ''sense of morality'' and
''not calculate in a small-minded way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the compromise made on the
compensation carried great meaning for how Germany is perceived in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cannot run badly, it must succeed,'' he said Monday on
N24 television.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the opening of a Berlin exhibition on the history of
the city's Jews, Schroeder named the labor fund as one of the
proofs that Germans hadn't pushed aside their past.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, launched last year by major German corporations, said
Sunday it might publicly name firms that have failed to contribute
to pressure them to pay. Jewish leaders in Germany also called for
exposing the holdouts.

<HEADLINE> Priest May Not Testify Vs. Attacker  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest who was stabbed
after hearing a confession has identified his attacker but is
reluctant to testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Mentrup, 41, was stabbed in the abdomen at his
home Friday after hearing the confession. He was in good condition
Monday at Middletown Regional Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mentrip identified the attacker on Friday, leading to an arrest
warrant for Marcus A. Finefrock.
</P>
<P>
   Finefrock, 25 of Columbus, turned himself in and pleaded
innocent Monday to one charge of felonious assault. He was released
on $25,000 cash bond posted by his father. He faces up to eight
years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Father Chuck told our detectives that Finefrock was the person
who had stabbed him,'' Chief Bill Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Finefrock has no criminal record, is a recent law school
graduate and expects to be acquitted, defense lawyer Clyde Bennett
II said.
</P>
<P>
   The priest is reluctant to help with the prosecution because of
the seal of secrecy involving confession, Becker said. Detectives
are consulting with prosecutors about how to proceed if the priest
doesn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be very, very difficult to prosecute a case without
somebody telling us what happened,'' the chief said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Priests are forbidden from revealing details of a confession.
</P>
<P>
   With no witnesses to the attack, Mentrup will have to decide how
much he can tell police.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a matter of judgment right now because he's the one who
was there and knows what happened,'' said Dan Andriacco, a
spokesman for the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Mentrup is principal of Fenwick High School, which is operated
by the archdiocese, and is an associate pastor of the Church of the
Incarnation in the Dayton suburb of Centerville.

<HEADLINE> Talks Resume To End Norway Strike  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's largest union and employers
negotiated late into the evening Monday in hopes of ending a
national strike before it escalates into the second biggest labor
conflict in this small nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of formal talks broke a stalemate between the two
sides that had lasted since 84,600 workers began the strike on
Wednesday after the union rank and file had rejected a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Yngve Haagensen, leader of the 800,000-member Norwegian
Confederation of Trade Unions, revealed that informal talks had
been going on throughout the strike and that he had secretly met
the employer's top representatives late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   New, formal negotiations, led by national labor mediator Reidar
Webster, began Monday afternoon after both sides said they were
looking for ways to quickly end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators were facing a 6 a.m. Tuesday deadline, when by the
union planned to step up the strike to include more than 102,000
people. That would make it Norway's worst labor conflict since
1921, when 150,000 people walked off the job over proposed pay
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The government, and the Norwegian Confederation of Business and
Industry has been under pressure because the strike could disrupt
automobile production in Europe as supplies of Norwegian-made parts
dry up.
</P>
<P>
   Automaker Saab stopped its Swedish production lines on Monday,
and Germany's BMW was reported to have threatened to drop Norwegian
suppliers if the strike forces it to shut down its plants.
</P>
<P>
   The strike could force tens of thousands of layoffs in the
European car industry. However, some Norwegian parts makers were
planning night shifts to catch up as soon as the strike ends.
</P>
<P>
   This nation of 4.5 million people is the world's second largest
oil exporter, but the union has so far allowed the nation's 3.2
million barrel per day oil production to continue unhampered.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was called when members of the Norwegian
Confederation of Trade Unions, an umbrella group for 27 unions,
rejected a contract offer in a national vote. That offer had been
for 3.5 percent to 4 percent in pay increases and a minimum fifth
week of paid vacation, a deal the union leadership had recommended.

<HEADLINE> US To Fly Peacekeepers to S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The Clinton administration on Monday decided to
assist the embattled United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra
Leone by providing air transport for a contingent of Bangladeshi
peacekeepers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration notified U.N. officials that Air Force
aircraft was prepared to fly a battalion of Bangladeshi
peacekeepers -- roughly 700 to 800 soldiers -- in coming days, a
senior administration official said. Officials had said last week
that they were considering providing similar transport for Indian
and Jordanian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who discussed the matter on condition of
anonymity, said the United States also sent a ''fact-finding'' team
from U.S. European Command to Nigeria on Monday to assess what help
the U.S. military might provide if Nigeria or other African nations
decide to augment their peacekeeping role in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision to provide air transport for the
Bangladeshi battalion of peacekeepers comes amid intense
discussions within the international community on the future of the
U.N. mission in Sierra Leone. It could turn out that the
Bangladeshis do not actually deploy, if the U.N. were to pull out
and be replaced by an all-African peacekeeping force, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had said earlier Monday
that the United States was looking at the possibility of providing
logistical support to the U.N. peacekeeping mission, but she was
not specific.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the administration is doing everything it can to
secure the release of the hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers who have
been kidnapped in Sierra Leone by rebels from the Revolutionary
United Front.
</P>
<P>
   In separate comments, President Clinton said the administration
was working on ways to enable the U.N. mission to carry out its
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important. I spent a lot of time on it the last four
or five days and we're working on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke to reporters during a joint news conference with
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do whatever we can to be helpful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the administration warned Americans against traveling
to Sierra Leone and ordered nonessential personnel out of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it began a helicopter airlift for Americans who
want to leave the West African country.
</P>
<P>
   About 170 American civilians, many working with international
charities, and 10 embassy staff live in Sierra Leone, a U.S.
official said. The first two helicopter flights carried 25 people
to the U.S. Embassy in Conakry, capital of neighboring Guinea.

<HEADLINE> A's Activate Velarde, Recall Prieto  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Second baseman Randy Velarde, who has not
played this season because of a knee injury, was activated Monday
by the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Prieto, who has not pitched since elbow surgery in 1998,
was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on Oakland's roster, Infielder Adam Piatt was
optioned to Sacramento and left-hander Ron Mahay was designated for
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde strained his left knee in the next-to-last game of
spring training on April 1 and opened the season on the disabled
list. He began his rehabilitation in the minors on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto was 2-1 with a 4.41 ERA in six starts at Sacramento. He
had major reconstructive surgery on his elbow in September 1998 and
has not pitched in the big leagues since April 19 of that year.

<HEADLINE> Panel Discusses Biotech Food  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Delegates from around the world begin meetings
today in another effort to devise United Nations approved rules for
labeling genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the biotech food industry could be shaped by
decisions made at the four-day conference of Codex Alimentarius, a
U.N. body that deals with food standards.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and European Union are in opposing camps in
the bureaucratic battle. Canada, which heads up a key committee on
food labeling, is trying to find a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal, favored by the United States, would require
genetically altered food to be labeled if it raises some risk to
health or environmental safety.
</P>
<P>
   A rival proposal, favored by the European Union, would required
all foods to be labeled even if there is no identified risk.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Kenny, an official with the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency, said Canada will seek to combine the two propositions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Canada supports mandatory labeling for health and safety
matters,'' Kenny said in an interview Monday. ''We're also very
supportive of the need for uniform international standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly hopeful at this meeting there's going to be
some ideas on the table, where we can talk about getting the best
of both proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could have an important impact on the fast-growing
biotech industry.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Police Nab Foot Cult Guru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese police on Tuesday arrested a cult leader
suspected of swindling followers who were told he could heal them
by examining their feet, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogen Fukunaga, the charismatic, silver-haired founder of the
Ho-no-Hana Sampogyo cult, was arrested on fraud charges, said
Shinosuke Miyanaga, a duty officer at Tokyo Metropolitan Police
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of the 55-year-old Fukunaga came several hours after
police obtained arrest warrants for him and 11 other senior member
of the cult, Miyanaga said.
</P>
<P>
   Fukunaga, along with several other members, were arrested at
Ho-no-Hana's headquarters in Tokyo's Shibuya ward as dozens of
reporters and TV camera crews jostled to get near as police led him
into a car.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's arrest comes 11 days after a Japanese court ruled for
the first time that Ho-no-Hana had defrauded some of its members,
who were warned that they would die or get cancer unless they had
the soles of their feet inspected by Fukunaga.
</P>
<P>
   The cult was ordered to pay 27 ex-followers $2.12 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against Ho-no-Hana surfaced about four years ago, and
more than a thousand former cult members have filed lawsuits
seeking a total of $50 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Guru Fukunaga claimed that the shape of people's feet revealed
their personality, with short toes signifying short tempers and fat
toes foretelling good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's name roughly translates as ''teaching of the
flower-three teachings.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 3, White Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Brian Rose, who failed to get out of the second in
two of his other four starts, pitched six strong innings and Carl
Everett homered as the Boston Red Sox beat the Chicago White Sox
3-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rose (2-2) started with three perfect innings and left after six
with a 3-2 lead after allowing just four hits and no walks. He
began the game with a 9.20 ERA following his appearance last
Tuesday, when he gave up four runs in 1 2-3 innings in a 7-6 win
over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe pitched 1 1-3 innings for his eighth save in eight
chances, lowering his ERA to 0.87 in 20 2-3 innings. After Paul
Konerko's leadoff single and a sacrifice, Carlos Lee grounded out,
Greg Norton walked and pinch-hitter Herbert Perry bounced into a
forceout.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won for the sixth time in eight games. Chicago, which
leads the AL Central, has lost seven of eight.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox failed to capitalize on a seventh-inning threat
after Tim Wakefield replaced Rose. With two outs, Chris Singleton
singled and took third on Lee's ground-rule double. But Wakefield
struck out Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's 11th homer had given Boston a 3-1 lead in the fourth
against Tanyon Sturtze (1-2), but Chicago closed in the sixth on
Ray Durham's triple and Frank Thomas' second sacrifice fly of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored in the first inning when its first three batters --
Jose Offerman, Trot Nixon and Brian Daubach -- singled, loading the
bases. But only one of them scored. Nomar Garciaparra followed with
a sacrifice fly before Troy O'Leary grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made it 2-0 in the third on a walk to Wilton Veras,
a groundout and an RBI double by Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Rose didn't allow a runner until Durham started the fourth with
a double. He took third on Jose Valentin's sacrifice bunt and
scored on Thomas' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had lost his first start of the season, 7-5 at Anaheim,
when he gave up five runs in 5 1-3 innings. And in his second
start, a 13-6 loss to Oakland, he allowed six runs in two-thirds of
an inning, the shortest outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But he rebounded with six shutout innings in a 10-0 win over
Detroit. He didn't pitch again until last Tuesday because of four
consecutive rainouts, and the layoff showed as he struggled against
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Red Sox recalled LHP Tim Young from Pawtucket of the
International League and optioned RHP Rob Stanifer to Pawtucket.
Stanifer had no record and an 8.59 ERA in four appearances covering
7 1-3 innings. ... Sturtze made his first start of the season,
replacing LHP Jim Parque, who began serving his three-game
suspension for his role in a brawl April 22 with Detroit. ... The
farthest Rose has gone with a perfect game is five innings last May
30. His bid ended when Cleveland's Dave Justice, leading off the
sixth, reached safely on a throwing error by Garciaparra at
shortstop. Rose gave up two unearned runs and left after six
innings. Boston won 4-2.

<HEADLINE> Bretons Meet To Denounce Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENNES, France (AP) -- More than 2,000 Bretons gathered outside
parliament in the capital of Brittany Monday to denounce growing
violence in the western region of France, notably the deadly April
bomb attack on a McDonald's that killed a restaurant employee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of cultural, political and other groups held a minute of
silence in memory of Laurence Turbec, 27, killed April 19 when a
bomb exploded at the fast food chain where she worked, in the town
of Quevert.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering came a day after three Breton nationalists,
members of Emgann, meaning ''combat,'' were formally placed under
investigation in connection with the Quevert bombing. The bombing
came four days after a smaller attack at another Brittany
McDonald's, in Pornic, in which there were no victims. A passerby
aborted an attack on a Rennes post office on the day of the Quevert
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday edition of Le Monde said that two other militants,
among some dozen detained for questioning, were to be placed under
investigation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three already under investigation denied any role in the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The clandestine Revolutionary Breton Army, known as ARB, claimed
responsibility for the Pornic attack but denied involvement in the
deadly bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Emgann issued a statement denouncing the Quevert
bombing and denying links to ARB. Days earlier, Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement had said that ARB and Emgann are ''nearly
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde, quoting sources close to the investigation, said
Monday that, with the arrests, police believe that the inner
structure of the network of Breton activitists has been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must talk. We must make peace,'' noted Celtic singer Alan
Stivell told the crowd in Rennes. ''Brittany is life.''
</P>
<P>
   Texts denouncing violence were read in French, Breton and Gallo,
a language used in one part of Brittany.

<HEADLINE> NATO Eyes Croatia As Balkan Model  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- NATO's secretary-general indicated Monday the
alliance would accept Croatia as a junior partner later this month,
pointedly setting up the new democratic government as a role model
for the country's former rivals in the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Lord George Robertson spoke at a conference on security and
stability in southeastern Europe which lauded past progress, but
largely focused on the Balkans' next feared flare points: Kosovo,
Montenegro and Serbia itself -- all controlled by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Milosevic regime ... constitutes the main threat to
stability in the entire region,'' warned Croatian Prime Minister
Ivica Racan, a former opposition leader who has been lauded by the
West since winning office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are witnessing the last stage of his regime. We shouldn't
draw too optimistic a conclusion from this fact,'' Racan told the
European leaders present.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot imagine Milosevic quietly withdrawing and living
peacefully in retirement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson strongly indicated that NATO entry for Croatia was
weeks away, drawing laughs at the overtness of his hint when he
said a country ''whose prime minister is here today'' would be up
for admission at a meeting of NATO member nations later this month
in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after NATO-led bombing drove Milosevic's forces
from the ethnic Albanian-majority province of Kosovo, Robertson
used the conference to take stock of the NATO campaign -- and
insisted it had been both inevitable and a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The organized, state-sponsored violence has stopped, and over
a million refugees have returned to Kosovo, with more on their
way,'' Robertson said. ''This is already a major victory.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Western goal of ethnic harmony in Kosovo still far off,
NATO officials had to cite what they said was a drop in the murder
rate to show that things were getting better in the province -- five
a week now, down from 50 weekly in June 1999, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent roughly 800 deaths, half Serbs and half
Kosovo Albanians, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia was singled out for its increasing democratization.
Racan's multiparty coalition won power in January elections after
the death of authoritarian President Franjo Tudjman, who led
Croatia during the Balkan wars and throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's new democratic government ''leads us to hope as we had
not hoped in the past,'' said Giuliano Amato, Italy's new premier.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia and Macedonia, two other former Yugoslav republics,
already are members of Partners for Peace.

<HEADLINE> NATO Eyes Croatia Balkan Model  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- NATO's secretary-general indicated Monday the
alliance would accept Croatia as a junior partner later this month,
pointedly setting up the new democratic government as a role model
for the country's former rivals in the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   Lord George Robertson spoke at a conference on security and
stability in southeastern Europe which lauded past progress, but
largely focused on the Balkans' next feared flare points: Kosovo,
Montenegro and Serbia itself -- all controlled by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Milosevic regime ... constitutes the main threat to
stability in the entire region,'' warned Croatian Prime Minister
Ivica Racan, a former opposition leader who has been lauded by the
West since winning office earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are witnessing the last stage of his regime. We shouldn't
draw too optimistic a conclusion from this fact,'' Racan told the
European leaders present.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot imagine Milosevic quietly withdrawing and living
peacefully in retirement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson strongly indicated that NATO entry for Croatia was

<HEADLINE> S.African Airline Brought To Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A young man who had dreams of
being a flight attendant clashed in court Monday with South
Africa's biggest airline, which rejected him as a job candidate
when blood tests showed he has the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is the first time a company has been brought to Labor
Court for allegedly discriminating against a person with HIV or
AIDS. A similar case is pending before the Constitutional Court,
the nation's highest tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma associated with the virus that has infected an
estimated 10 percent of South Africa's 40 million people is so
great that Judge Deon Basson ordered the prospective flight
attendant's identity withheld. During the trial, which began
Monday, he is being identified only as ''Mr. A.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen activists wearing T-shirts emblazoned ''HIV
positive'' appeared in support of Mr. A and quietly observed the
proceedings in the small wood-panelled courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   With AIDS beginning to hit South Africa's work force, the
unprecedented case sheds light on how many corporations treat
victims of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a great deal of denial and ignorance,'' said Karen
Michael, an AIDS expert and researcher at the University of Natal
in Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Some business executives look at AIDS as an answer to South
Africa's 40 percent unemployment rate and do not think it will
affect their own workers, Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, the plaintiff applied for a job at SAA as a
flight attendant. After he was given a battery of tests he was told
he was a good candidate. But days later, blood tests revealed he
had the human immunodeficiency virus, and he was summarily rejected
as a candidate. He was sent home with no counseling.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for SAA, Ishmael Semenya, said the airline did not
want to employ Mr. A because they believed if he was given a yellow
fever vaccine, required for most travel within Africa, it could
damage his health. Mr. A's legal team, including AIDS experts,
insisted the vaccine would not threaten his health and said he was
being discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I was badly treated,'' the young man murmured to a
reporter during a break. ''I don't think I deserved this.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and wants an end to
SAA's policy of excluding people with HIV from being hired.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Honor Fallen Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With a wail of sirens, Israel slowed its usual
frenetic activity Monday and began a solemn, nationwide tribute to
nearly 20,000 soldiers killed in the nation's wars and terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a uniquely Israeli contrast, Memorial Day is followed
immediately by raucous Independence Day celebrations, underlining
the link the people see between the wars and their nation's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nov. 29, 1947, when the United Nations approved the
creation of the state of Israel, 19,109 people have been killed in
military service or in hostile acts, according to the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In a close-knit country of 6 million people, that translates
into a personal sense of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses close early for the ceremonies that run from
Monday evening to Tuesday evening, and Israelis visit cemeteries to
honor fallen friends, relatives and schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sound twice on Memorial Day, once Monday night
and again Tuesday morning, directing Israelis to stop what they are
doing and pay tribute. Traffic comes to a halt, and drivers stand
next to their cars on streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Ezer Weizman, both
ex-generals, attended the opening ceremony at the Western Wall in
the Old City of Jerusalem, Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Again we are with you, my brothers,'' army chief Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz said at the ceremony, ''and the pain that scorches like
the burn of forged iron is too hard to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   After the two-year war that followed the creation of the state,
Israeli soldiers went to battle again in 1956, 1967, 1973 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a transition ceremony is to take place at the Mt.
Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem, marking the end of Memorial
Day and the beginning of Independence Day, complete with a
fireworks display.

<HEADLINE> No Contest Plea in Desert Death  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- A man who claimed his best friend begged
him to put him out of his misery after they got lost in the desert
without water pleaded no contest Monday to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Raffi Kodikian, 26, of Boston admitted stabbing to death his
friend, David Coughlin, last August during a camping trip in the
backcountry of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. He pleaded to
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''You start understanding people in dehydrated states do some
crazy things,'' said defense attorney Gary Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian could get up to 20 years in prison at the end of a
sentencing hearing that is expected to end on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea bargain, Kodikian preserves the right to appeal a
judge's ruling barring him from mounting a defense of temporary
insanity based on dehydration-induced dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian said Coughlin, 26, of Millis, Mass., pleaded with him
to end his pain after the two got lost and ran out of water.
Kodikian said he and his friend believed Coughlin would die.
</P>
<P>
   ''David pleads with Raffi to end his life, and Raffi -- in what
most people call a mercy killing -- does as his best friend
wishes,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Park workers rescued Kodikian about six hours after his friend
died.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators said that Coughlin had moderate to severe
deydration but that his body fluids were not at a lethal level when
he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Klein, who performed an autopsy on Coughlin, said
Coughlin had three cuts on his right wrist that could have been the
result of a suicide attempt. While Coughlin was dehydrated, Klein
said, the cause of death was two stab wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Hopkins, who treated Kodikian at Carlsbad Medical
Center the day he was found, testified that Kodikian was
dehydrated, had a fever of 102 and had an extremely elevated sodium
level and pulse rate. Kodikian was treated and released in three
hours, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Les Williams said that Kodikian had agreed to kill
himself as part of a pact they made after running out of water and
getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian ''did have marks on his wrist, across his wrist, but
they were not deep,'' and he said his knife was too dull, Williams
said. He was dehydrated, ''but not to the point that he didn't know
what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the two men didn't take enough water and were
totally unprepared for the possibility that their one-day trip
could turn into four.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boys were the best of friends, never meant any harm to
anybody, including themselves,'' he said. ''They get lost, have no
water for three days, are severely dehydrated, both in extreme
agony, and both attempt suicide.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Thomas Ferrel Harris, who raced on the
American Race Car Association circuit across four decades, died
Sunday of a heart attack. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   Harris joined the ARCA circuit in 1966. He won the ARCA 200 at
Daytona in 1983 and had three pole-qualifying runs at the track
during his career. Harris had top 10 qualifying runs at both
Daytona and Talladega in 1990.

Henry Laskau
</P>
<P>
   COCONUT CREEK, Fla. (AP) -- Henry Laskau, who slipped out of a
Nazi labor camp, made his way to this country and ended up in the
National Track and Field Hall of Fame after dominating race walking
for more than a decade, died Sunday following an operation. He was
83.
</P>
<P>
   Laskau won 42 national titles, held five national records and
made three Olympic appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Laskau was voted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He became just the second race walker among the Hall's 172
members, joining 1986 inductee Ron Laird.
</P>
<P>
   In his native Berlin, Laskau was a 22-year-old middle distance
runner on a Jewish team when he was taken to a labor camp by the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   After about three months at the camp, a sympathetic guard told
Laskau he'd turn his back if Laskau were to leave that night.
Laskau made his way to France, where he boarded a ship to Cuba and
nine months later, he was in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Laskau did counterintelligence work overseas for the Army in
World War II, then went into the import-export business while still
finding time to run.
</P>
<P>
   One day after the war, a walker saw Laskau running and suggested
he try race walking. At age 30, in 1946, he entered his first race
and won.

Perry Mendel
</P>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Perry Mendel, founder and former
chairman of KinderCare Learning Centers, which grew into the
nation's largest day-care chain, died Saturday from complications
from cancer. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mendel founded KinderCare in Montgomery in 1969 and capitalized
on the growing number of women entering the workplace and needing
child care. Through the 1970s his company became the nation's
biggest day-care operation, with more than 1,000 centers in more
than 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Montgomery-based corporation ventured into
financial services and retailing and Mendel's career crumbled in
financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to failure to pay taxes on fees he received in
a 1985 deal involving Michael Milken, who headed the junk bond
department of the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Mendel served about nine months of a one-year federal sentence.
</P>
<P>
Michael Morano
</P>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Michael Morano, a former state senator
known as ''Mr. Highway Safety,'' died Sunday. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Morano, a Republican, was an advocate of transportation safety
during his 28 years rin the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the bridge on Interstate 95 over the Mianus River was
dedicated to Morano. He had worked with town, state and federal
officials in the aftermath of the 1983 Mianus River bridge
collapse, in which three people died and three others were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Morano was co-chairman of the General Assembly's Transportation
Committee from 1984 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His political career began in 1960, when he beat former Gov.
Lowell Weicker Jr., then a Greenwich lawyer, for the Republican
nomination for state representative.
</P>
<P>
   Morano eventually became deputy speaker of the House. In 1976 he
was elected to the Senate, and remained in leadership positions
throughout his legislative career.
</P>

Henry J. Nicols
</P>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Henry J. Nicols, an AIDS activist and
Boy Scout who gained the world's attention after announcing that he
was HIV positive, died Monday from injuries suffered in a car
crash. He was 26.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Nicols launched an Eagle Scout project that grew into a
worldwide education campaign to dispel ignorance and stereotypes
surrounding AIDS. Nicols, a hemophiliac, contracted the HIV virus
during a blood transfusion in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   His activism took him to Ireland and Japan and landed him an
audience with Presidents Bush and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Martin Schilling
</P>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Martin Schilling, a German-born retired
Raytheon Co. executive who helped develop the world's first large
ballistic missile, died April 30 from heart failure. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling worked with Wernher von Braun in Peenemunde, Germany,
during World War II to develop the once dreaded 47-foot-long V-2
missile. About 1,000 V-2s were fired in London during the war, and
some 4,000 were launched against Allied soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was recruited in 1940 by the Peenemunde team because
he had a Ph.D. in applied physics, and could be valuable in the
development of missiles. He eventually became technical director of
the German Army test organization at Peenemunde.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, von Braun and 126 Peenemunde scientists,
including Schilling, were brought to Fort Bliss in Texas, where
they continued to develop rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   The team was then moved to Huntsville, Ala, where they launched
America's first satellite into space in 1958. Later that year,
Schilling joined Raytheon, headquartered in Lexington, one of the
world's largest electronics and missile system contractors.

   DENVER (AP) -- Pete Smythe, who worked as a broadcaster at KOA
radio and television from the 1940s through the 1960s and continued
to record commercials into his 80s, died Saturday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Smythe is the male voice on the concourse trains at Denver
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   As a popular broadcaster on KOA radio, Smythe created East Tin
Cup, a fictional small town replete with characters voiced by
Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   Smythe was also known through his show on KOA-TV called
''Smythe's General Store'' which also featured characters voiced by
Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, a daughter and two sons.

Rudolf Stohler
</P>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Rudolf Stohler, an international
authority on mollusks who helped develop rules for collecting
mussels safely, died April 24 of heart failure. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, Stohler helped pinpoint the organisms that made
mussels unsafe to eat at certain times of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the UC Berkeley staff in 1933 and taught cytology,
zoology and biology. He was also curator of the invertebrate
zoology museum and founded the Northern Malacozoological Club.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Series Rattles Italy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP)-- A series of moderate-intensity earthquakes jarred
central Italy on Monday, sending some people running into the
streets but causing no reported damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest of the quakes had a preliminary magnitude of 4.4,
Italy's National Geophysics Institute said.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter was near the small towns of Faeza and Forli, 285
miles northeast of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.4 jolt was the strongest of more than 200 to hit the area
since April 20, the geophysics institute said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual amount of seismic activity is wearing on the nerves
of some residents. Although authorities checked buildings and found
no damage, an unknown number of residents left their homes after
the mid-afternoon quake and declined to go back -- preferring to
remain out in the open.

<HEADLINE> Royals 4, Tigers 1, 11 innings  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Jermaine Dye hit a two-run double in the 11th
inning and Kansas City beat the Detroit Tigers 4-1 Monday night,
snapping the Royals' nine-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez singled off Doug Brocail (1-2) to start the 11th and
Johnny Damon sacrificed. With two outs, Mike Sweeney beat out an
infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Dye followed with a line drive over leaping right fielder Luis
Polonia and the ball rolled to the wall as Sanchez and Sweeney
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson relieved and was greeted by Mark Quinn's RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Clark hit a solo homer for Detroit. Sweeney hit a solo shot
for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Damon's streak of 10 straight games with leadoff hit in the
first inning ended when he grounded out. He had the longest such
string since 1975 -- the Elias Sports Bureau, which keeps major
league statistics, was unable to research the obscure stat before
then.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Juan Encarnacion ended his 19-game hitting streak,
tops in the majors, going hitless in five at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Both starters pitched nine innings, giving up one run apiece --
each on solo homers -- on a combined seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Suppan, who had lost three of his last four starts, allowed
three hits, two by Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan, who had four complete games last season, gave up three
hits with three walks and two strikeouts in nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santiago (3-1) pitched two perfect innings for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weaver, who pitched a complete game in a losing effort
against Chicago on April 28, went the first nine innings in search
of his first win of the season for Detroit. He allowed one run on
four hits with two walks and four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan kept the Tigers hitless until Clark, who had 31 homers
last season, gave Detroit a 1-0 lead with his fourth homer, leading
off the Tigers' fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney made it 1-1 on his 11th homer with one out in the sixth.
Notes: The Royals, whose 14-4 home record is the best in the
majors, came in with a 2-11 road record, worst in the AL. ... Both
Clark and Sweeney homered to left. Of the first 17 homers hit in
Comerica Park, the Tigers' spacious new stadium, only seven have
been to left. ... Royals center fielder Carlos Beltran made a
diving catch to rob Encarnacion in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dwight Gooden didn't feel at home in his first
road game in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who spent the first 13 years of his career with the Mets
and Yankees, was pounded for six runs and three homers before being
knocked out in the fifth inning of Tampa Bay's 6-3 loss to the
Yankees on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez hit a three-run homer in the first inning, and
Clay Bellinger and Paul O'Neill finished the job with homers in the
fifth off Gooden (2-2), who was pitching in New York for the first
time since Sept. 19, 1997, when he was with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (2-1) allowed three runs and nine hits in 6 2-3
innings as the Yankees won for the ninth time in 11 games. Mariano
Rivera, who blew his second save chance Sunday against Baltimore,
pitched the ninth for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   New York has been the scene of some of Gooden's best moments of
his career, including the no-hitter he pitched against Seattle at
Yankee Stadium on May 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But he also went through drug and alcohol abuse that derailed a
potential Hall of Fame career and sidelined him in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland tried to keep Gooden, a crowd favorite in New York,
from pitching at Yankee Stadium the past two years out of fear he
would put too much pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears might have been warranted as Gooden struggled with
his control early, walking three batters in the first. Two of those
walks scored when Martinez hit a shot into the upper-deck in right
field for his fourth homer, giving New York a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden settled down after that, facing 10 batters over the next
three innings, before running into trouble in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger, in an 0-for-11 slump, led off by hitting a high
fastball over the center-field fence for his second homer. Ricky
Ledee followed with a walk and one out later, O'Neill hit his third
homer, making it 6-3 and knocking out Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Morris, the 36-year-old former high school science teacher,
came on and got two outs in his first appearance at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored on a pair of run-scoring outs in the
second and an RBI double by Jose Canseco in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay threatened in the sixth, loading the bases with one
out. Mike DiFelice hit a hard grounder that Martinez fielded in the
hole at first to start a 3-6-1 double play. Pettitte stretched like
a first baseman to end the play and pumped his fist before patting
Martinez and shortstop Derek Jeter on the back.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gooden faced the Yankees in Game 4 of the 1998 ALCS,
allowing three runs in 4 2-3 innings of a 4-0 loss for Cleveland.
The only teams Gooden hasn't faced are Arizona and the Mets. ...
Jeter, in a 6-for-35 slump, hit into some bad luck in the third
inning when his hard grounder bounced off 3B Vinny Castilla's glove
right to SS Kevin Stocker, who completed the 5-6-3 play. ...
Pettitte got called for a balk in the fourth inning when he dropped
the ball while standing on the rubber with Bubba Trammell at first.
... Former Yankee Tim Raines threw out the first pitch. ... Tampa
Bay manager Larry Rothschild was ejected by plate umpire Wally Bell
for arguing a strike call in the seventh inning. ... Jorge Posada
went 3-for-3 and is 10-for-14 on the homestand, raising his average
to .367. ... Scott Brosius hit into a double play with runners on
first and second in the sixth inning when he hit a ball just in
front of home plate and didn't run to first, thinking it was foul.

<HEADLINE> Ad Actors Announce Interim Deal  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- More than 300 commercial producers, including
a media consulting firm for Al Gore's campaign, have signed interim
agreements with striking actors' unions, the unions said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists, which represent about 135,000 actors,
went on strike May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Democratic presidential
contender, said their campaign consultant had agreed to the wages
and working conditions the unions are seeking from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They obviously want to stand with the union workers here,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The unions said that a media firm working for Republican
candidate George W. Bush also signed an agreement, but the Bush
campaign said it could not confirm that Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-week 1988 strike, about 500 commercial producers
accepted interim agreements, compared with the 300 who signed this
time in one week, SAG spokesman Greg Krizman said.
</P>
<P>
   Krizman declined to estimate the total number of commercial
producers. A major trade group, the American Association of
Advertising Agencies, includes about 750 members.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Shepard, a Washington lawyer negotiating for the
advertisers, suggested that only smaller, ''peripheral'' ad
agencies agreed to deal with the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ad industry is united and firmly behind its decision to
stand by its last and best offer,'' Shepard said. ''There have been
no defections from any major advertiser or major ad agency in
regard to the interim agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants, he added, ''don't have the same economic
interest that commercial advertisers do.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay structure for commercials is at issue in the strike.
Actors get a minimum of about $478 for a day's work and also get
''pay-per-play'' residuals of roughly $50 to $120 each time a spot
airs on network television.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cable TV commercials, performers receive only a
flat fee of $1,000 or less for each 13-week, unlimited run. With
two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors are
demanding that pay-per-play be extended to cable.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want to extend the flat fee from cable to the
networks.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 6, Orioles 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Darrin Fletcher hit a grand slam in the fourth
inning as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles for the
11th straight time, 6-5 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista also homered for the Blue Jays, who have hit 48
homers in 19 home games and are on pace to finish with 207, which
would shatter the major league home record of 149 set by Colorado
at Coors Field in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's fifth career slam gave Toronto a 6-2 lead. After
Jason Johnson (0-2) loaded the bases in the fourth inning on
singles by Carlos Delgado and Batista and a walk to Brad Fullmer,
Fletcher homered to right center.
</P>
<P>
   Batista's two-run shot in the second had put the Blue Jays ahead
2-0. Five of Fletcher's six home runs, and seven of Batista's nine
homers have come at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has lost five of six overall, and 12 straight in
Toronto. The Orioles closed to 6-5 in the eighth on RBI singles by
Mike Bordick and Albert Belle, but Billy Koch got three outs for
his eighth save, striking out Bordick to end the game with a runner
on second. Bordick was 3-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar (3-4) gave up five runs and 12 hits, and four
walks in seven innings. Johnson allowed six runs and six hits in
four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson's two-run double tied the score in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Blue Jays have homered in a club record 19 straight
home games. ... There have been 73 home runs hit at SkyDome this
season. ... The Blue Jays infamous ''Hot Dog Blaster'' wasn't
working again. Fans were showered with bits of wiener last month
after the hot dogs fell apart in midair. On Monday, the Blaster's
first attempt at shooting a hot dog failed when a wiener just fell
to the ground. A worried member of the promotion staff quickly
canceled the promotion. They were forced to throw them into the
stands. ... The Orioles held a team meeting before the game. ...
Attendance was 15,103.

<HEADLINE> Navy Resumes Vieques Training  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. Navy warplanes dropped dummy
bombs at the military training ground on Vieques island Monday,
fulfilling a pledge to resume operations despite protesters' claims
that some of their colleagues were still on the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   The training -- the first on the Puerto Rican island in over a
year -- came after 224 protesters were peacefully removed from the
range, most of them during a raid by federal agents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters want the United States to stop using the island
for its training, saying decades of bombing have harmed their
health, stunted tourism, harmed endangered species and destroyed
fishing grounds, coral reefs and mangroves.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and Puerto Rico's governor had agreed that
limited operations would resume. The renewed operations Monday were
''in accordance with the presidential directives concerning
training at Vieques,'' Navy spokesman Robert Nelson said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Two A-4 Skyhawk warplanes each dropped six 25-pound Mark-76
non-explosive bombs into the range, Nelson said. The exercise
completed a certification process for range personnel and was
required before the range could be used by Atlantic fleet aircraft
and ships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy notified Puerto Rico's government of its intent to
resume training by letter on April 18, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters reacted angrily Monday and claimed that there were
still several demonstrators still on the range, which has been
patrolled by military security since Thursday's raid. Nelson said
the Navy knew of no holdouts. The Navy has admitted, however, that
six people were removed from the range Friday and Sunday and two
more on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they start any kind of bombing, there will an immediate and
large-scale response from the community,'' said protest leader
Robert Rabin. ''They know there are still people out on the bombing
range, and they are not going to risk taking more lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The range is located about eight miles from a civilian zone
where 9,300 residents live.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Vieques are very indignant now. It is an act of
provocation,'' said protester Angel de Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Morey, Puerto Rico's secretary of state, said he had
voiced concerns to the Navy on Sunday over the possibility of stray
protesters being hit by inert ordnance. ''Today's exercises
occurred in open terrain and in a smaller area (than usual) to
minimize'' that threat, Morey said.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the renewed training spread rapidly on radio talk shows
in Puerto Rico, and opposition politicians vented their anger that
Puerto Rico's government had been secretly alerted at least two
weeks ago that training would resume. Independence Party leader
Ruben Berrios, one of those detained Thursday, and other protesters
planned to return to Vieques Tuesday to plot strategy on impeding
further training -- including possibly re-entering the range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupied the Navy's Atlantic fleet range after
civilian security guard David Sanes Rodriguez was killed by stray
bombs during exercises on April 19, 1999. The Navy suspended its
exercises after Sanes' death.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello agreed
to let the Navy resume limited training with ''dummy'' bombs. In
exchange, Vieques residents will vote -- probably next year -- on
whether the Navy should leave Vieques by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Kevin Green, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Southern
Command, said Thursday that the Navy would scale back its bombing
to a maximum of 90 days per year from the previous 180 days, and
that only non-explosive bombs will be dropped. Those limitations
were spelled out in the Clinton-Rossello agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, the Navy purchased two-thirds of the 21-by-4 mile
island, reserving a central portion for residents. Despite
islanders' objections, the military has refused to stop training on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy argued that without Vieques -- used to prepare for every
U.S. military conflict since World War II -- lives could be lost in
an era of precision bombing. Vieques is the only place where the
Atlantic Fleet can hold simultaneous air, land and sea operations
with live munitions, the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Robert Natter said Thursday that exercises being
conducted by the George Washington carrier battle group elsewhere
in the Caribbean and off the U.S. East Coast were ''deficient'' in
naval gunfire training. The battle group is scheduled to begin a
six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in late June.

<HEADLINE> KLLM Board Gets Two Buyout Bids  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOORE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Two offers to buy KLLM Transport Services
Inc. are before a special company panel, including one from a
tandem that includes WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers and KLLM chairman, president and CEO Jack Liles III are
sparring with Robert Low, owner of a privately held trucking firm
in Missouri, for ownership of the Richland-based trucking company.
</P>
<P>
   Low owns New Prime Inc., a Springfield, Mo.-based trucking
company.
</P>
<P>
   KLLM's board of directors formed a subcommittee, including board
member Leland Speed, who will chair the panel, to consider both
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Other committee members include Walter Neely, a finance
professor at Millsaps College in Jackson, and David Metzler, a
trucking company executive from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Broughton, a transportation analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the subcommittee's job is to ensure
KLLM's shareholders get the maximum amount of money for their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll look at it and figure who is offering the best value
to shareholders and that process may end up including a process by
which they hold an informal auction between the two bidders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Liles and Ebbers had offered on April 20 to pay $8.25 per share,
or $35 million, for KLLM's 4.25 million outstanding shares. Low,
who holds a 13.7-percent stake in the company, had offered $7.75
per share, or $32.9 million, on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said the book value for KLLM is approximately $12.38
per share, higher than the initial offers by Low and Liles-Ebbers.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts may have changed in the offers made to the
subcommittee, which is keeping the bid amounts secret because the
bidding is ''an ongoing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Liles and Low have both signed confidentiality agreements
barring them from discussing their bids. Ebbers has not discussed
his participation in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Monday on the Nasdaq, shares of KLLM were unchanged
from Friday at $8.31\.
</P>
<P>
   KLLM has more than 2,000 refrigerated trailers that haul food,
medicine and cosmetics across North America. The company employs
nearly 2,000 workers and had 1999 sales of $234.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime has more than 3,100 refrigerated, flatbed and tanker
trailers. It employs nearly 3,350 workers.

   Liles and Ebbers had offered on April 20 to pay $8.25 per share,
or $35 million, for KLLM's 4.25 million outstanding shares. Low,
who holds a 13.7-percent stake in the company, had offered $7.75
per share, or $32.9 million, on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said the book value for KLLM is approximately $12.38
per share, higher than the initial offers by Low and Liles-Ebbers.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Ready To Sue LAPD  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Justice Department stands ready to file a
police misconduct lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, U.S.
officials said Monday, but will give city authorities time to try
to work out a voluntary settlement instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for the
department's civil rights division, met with officials for over an
hour, then issued a statement outlining the federal government's
position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we notified officials of the city of Los Angeles, the
Police Commission and the LAPD that the Civil Rights Division has
been authorized to file a police misconduct lawsuit,'' Lee's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This suit would allege that the LAPD has engaged in a pattern
or practice of constitutional violations through excessive force,
false arrests, and unreasonable searches and seizures, and that
management deficiencies have allowed this misconduct to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Justice Department concluded that ''these types of
misconducts occur on a regular basis,'' Lee added that the majority
of Los Angeles Police Department officers are ''ethical,
hardworking and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Justice Department is willing to defer filing the
lawsuit to allow further talks aimed at reaching a settlement -- a
normal procedure in such an action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city has accepted our offer to begin discussions toward a
resolution of this issue and has agreed to schedule a meeting next
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the talks will not interfere with continuing criminal
investigations by the Justice Department into whether individual
LAPD officers violated federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said any settlement of their four-year
probe into alleged discriminatory practices by the LAPD would
involve revisions in police training and procedures to end a
pattern of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been monitoring the LAPD since 1996
to determine whether it shows a pattern of abusive behavior. Its
focus recently has turned to the so-called Rampart scandal in which
officers at the department's Rampart station are said to have
beaten, framed and even shot innocent people in the poor, largely
minority area they patrol near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   So far about 30 police officers have been relieved of duty
because of the scandal and 73 felony convictions have been
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Police Commission President Gerald Chaleff said,
''We share the same goal, which is to make certain that the Los
Angeles Police Department is performing its duties professionally
and ethically and that proper management oversight is in place.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Retailers Halt Violent Game Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two major Chicago-based retailers have announced
plans to halt all sales of ultra-violent, ''M''-rated video games
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Ward announced its decision in a brief letter to
Attorney General Jim Ryan last week, and rival Sears Roebuck and
Co. followed suit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had urged retailers to halt the sale of ''M''-rated video
games to Illinois customers under the age of 17. But in the letter
to Ryan, Charles H. Knittle, Ward's vice president for governmental
affairs and corporate communications, said Wards was eliminating
all sales of the items.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ban will be throughout our chain,'' Knittle said in a
telephone interview Monday. ''We made our decision primarily on the
fact that this category of games was not in keeping with Ward's
objectives as a family-oriented retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wards has stores in 32 states, including 18 in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Nicholson, director of public relations for Sears, said
''M''-rated items made up only about 5 percent of the games
inventory at Sears' 860 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of today, we are canceling orders for more ''M''-rated
video games, and we will be selling out our very small inventory,''
Nicholson said. ''After that, we will no longer sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''M'' rating, for ''mature,'' is affixed by the
Entertainment Software Rating Board to games the industry group
deems too violent for people under the age of 17, but there are no
legal prohibitions against the sale of such games to younger
people.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 3, Braves 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- John Rocker balked home the winning run with two
outs in the ninth inning, and the Florida Marlins scored three
unearned runs to beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-2 count on Cliff Floyd and Danny Bautista at third,
Rocker took his position on the rubber and the ball fell out of his
glove to the ground. Second base umpire Mike DiMuro signaled a
balk, and Bautista trotted home.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker and Braves manager Bobby Cox briefly spoke to DiMuro as
the umpires left the field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first game-ending balk in the NL since July 4, 1993,
when the Braves beat the Marlins 4-3 at Atlanta. Deion Sanders
scored on rookie Matt Turner's balk with one out in the bottom of
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   That had been the last game-winning balk in the majors until
April 28, when Texas' Jeff Zimmerman did it in a 4-3 loss at
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Florida were tied at 2 when Paul Bako led off the
ninth with a single against Rudy Seanez (1-1). Pinch-runner
Bautista advanced to second when first baseman Andres Galarraga
mishandled a pickoff throw.
</P>
<P>
   After pinch-hitter Dave Berg fouled out attempting to bunt, Luis
Castillo grounded out, advancing Bautista to third.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, suspended earlier this season for making disparaging
comments about minorities and others, then sprinted into the game
to a mixed reception, with more jeers than cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker intentionally walked pinch-hitter Mark Smith, bringing
Floyd to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lost for the fourth time in five games since winning
15 in a row. They committed three errors and wasted a fine
performance by Greg Maddux, who allowed eight hits and two runs and
struck out a season-high 10 in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux drove in the Braves' first run with a two-out single in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Vladimir Nunez, in danger of losing his spot in the
rotation, made his best start of the season and departed for a
pinch-hitter in the sixth with the score 2-2. He lowered his ERA
from 10.48 to 9.17.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli (3-1) pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins missed a chance to take the lead in the sixth when
Castillo struck out with runners at second and third to end the
inning. Castillo doesn't have an RBI in 58 at-bats this season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Brian Jordan lined out to third with the bases loaded
to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took advantage of an error by rookie shortstop Rafael
Furcal to score two unearned runs in the first.
</P>
<P>
   After Mark Kotsay singled and Floyd walked, Furcal bobbled a
potential double-play grounder. Floyd, sliding into second, kicked
the ball into the outfield, allowing him to continue to third while
Kotsay scored. Floyd then came home on Mike Lowell's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez walked the first three batters in the sixth but allowed
only one run -- on Galarraga's double-play grounder -- to tie the
score. Brian Jordan's groundout ended the inning.
Notes: Maddux lowered his lifetime ERA against the Marlins to 1.91
in 18 starts. ... Braves catcher Fernando Lunar, making his major
league debut, went 0-for-3 and threw out one of three base
stealers.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 10, Mariners 1  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rick Helling pitched six shutout innings
and Chad Curtis drove in three runs as the Texas Rangers beat the
Seattle Mariners 10-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton led off the Texas first with a triple and the
Rangers went ahead for good with three runs, highlighted by Curtis'
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Jason McDonald had a leadoff homer in the second, and Mike Lamb
scored after hitting doubles to start the fourth and sixth innings.
Clayton homered to open the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (4-1) allowed just three singles before he left with
swelling on his pitching hand, a result of being hit by a
comebacker that ended the second. He struck out three and walked
just one.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing out Tom Lampkin to end the second, Helling showed
no obvious ill effects until he began warming up prior to the
seventh. He had retired the Mariners 1-2-3 in the third and fourth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   But when Helling came out to start the seventh, he became
experiencing discomfort in his right hand. He consulted with
manager Johnny Oates and then left with a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start last Tuesday, Helling allowed just one hit
in 7 1-3 innings against Tampa Bay, an 8-1 victory. He has worked
at least six innings in six straight starts after going just 3 1-3
innings on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   After Clayton's leadoff triple in the first, Luis Alicea had an
RBI single on the next pitch by Brett Tomko (1-2). After
consecutive walks loaded the bases, Curtis singled with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, in the Rangers lineup because outfielders Rusty Greer
and Gabe Kapler are on the disabled list, hit a 422-foot homer into
the upper deck to start the second inning. After his third homer in
as many games, he added an RBI single in the fourth that scored
Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb led off the sixth with another double and later scored on
Alicea's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored off Jeff Zimmerman, who struck out the first
two batters he faced after relieving Helling. Lampkin then doubled
and scored on Lamb's error at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb got the run back with an RBI single in the bottom of the
seventh after Curtis had a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas OF Ruben Mateo had three hits to extend his hitting
streak to 12 games, the longest this season by an AL rookie. ...
With the loss, Seattle (16-13) missed the opportunity to match its
best start ever through 29 games. ... P Justin Thompson, recalled
from a rehab assignment May 1, had a precautionary MRI done Monday
after complaining of pain in his left shoulder during exercises
Friday. The Rangers want Thompson and the MRI examined by Dr. James
Andrews of Birmingham, Ala., who did surgery on Thompson's throwing
shoulder last Aug. 27. ... The Rangers have scored at least 10 runs
in three of their last four games.

200 miles southeast near Ruidoso burned 4,500 acres and forced the evacuation of
at least 200 homes. High wind caused problems with both fires, and Gov. Gary

<HEADLINE> Rockies 3, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Pedro Astacio pitched a three-hitter and Todd
Helton hit a two-run homer as the Colorado Rockies, snapping a
string of 22 scoreless innings, beat the Houston Astros 3-1 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio (4-2) allowed Richard Hidalgo's leadoff homer in the
fifth, which hit the top of the left-field wall and bounced over
for his 10th home run of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, who also gave up Bill Spiers' leadoff single in the
eighth and Hidalgo's single in the ninth, struck out 10, walked two
and hit a batter in his first complete game this season, the 21st
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies didn't score in the first, tying the team record of
22 consecutive innings set from Aug. 11-14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado failed to score in the final three innings against
Montreal last Wednesday, was blanked by the Giants twice and then
was rained out Sunday at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who went 3-for-3, homered in the second off Chris Holt
(1-5) after Jeff Cirillo's leadoff walk.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo's sacrifice fly in the third followed Mike Lansing's
double and Larry Walker's infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed just two more hits, leaving after Cirillo's one-out
double in the eighth. He struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Houston escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the eighth when
Jeffrey Hammonds hit a grounder off Jay Powell, which forced
Lansing at home, and Neifi Perez flied out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Astacio has seven of the 10 double-digit strikeout
performances in Rockies history. It was the third three-hitter of
his career, the first since Sept. 29, 1992, at Cincinnati. ...
Cirillo extended his hitting streak to a career-best 14 games. ,,,
Astros RF Moises Alou is scheduled to come off the 15-day disabled
list Friday after recovering from a strained right calf. ... Helton
is the only player who has appeared in all 31 games for the
Rockies. ... Forty-eight homers have been hit in 13 games at Enron
Field this season, an average of 3.69, with 24 by visitors and 24
by the Astros.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Found in Fetid Mexico Well  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- The bodies of four family members were
found Monday in a foul-smelling well, the apparent victims of
asphyxiation from methane gas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, 33-year-old Saturnino Dominguez, apparently
was trying to clean out the artesian well next to his house in the
coastal town of Azoyu when he was overcome by methane fumes, said
state civil protection authority Marcos Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife, Francisca Martinez, 19, found him unconscious,
she tried to rescue him, but was asphyxiated as well. Martinez's
brother, 18-year-old Ricardo Ramirez, and a nephew of the couple,
19-year-old Ciro Roque also died when they tried to rescue the
couple, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said officials from the state-owned gas company Pemex
are also investigating whether there was any possibility that
gasoline could have leaked from tanks at a gas station 500 feet
from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Pemex officials told authorities they had just conducted an
inspection of the gas station last week and did not find any leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Civil protection and local authorities were conducting tests to
determine what types of gases were emanating from the well and what
risks they presented.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also planned to conduct an autopsy on the bodies.
There were no signs of violence or foul play, however, Gonzalez
said.

By DOUG MELLGREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- A strike that threatened European automobile
production was called off Tuesday after Norway's largest union and
employers agreed on a new contract in all-night talks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reached in the sixth day of a strike by 84,600
union members, which the union had threatened to turn into Norway's
second largest labor conflict by pushing the number of strikers to
over 102,000 on Tuesday. The deal was reached just two hours before
that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the new offer also has to be put to a vote by union
members, strikers were returning to work immediately pending the
outcome of that referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The strike had sent a chill through Europe's car industry
because it stopped supplies of Norwegian-made parts, which could
have caused widespread layoffs as production lines outside Norway
were forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Automaker Saab stopped its Swedish production lines on Monday,
and Germany's BMW was reported to have threatened to drop Norwegian
suppliers if the strike forces it to shut down its plants.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract includes across the board raises of 16 cents
per hour for all union members, while the lowest paid members would
get 38 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the union nor the employers immediately estimated the
percentage increase in pay.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began Wednesday, after union members rejected a
contract package, even though it had been recommended by their
leadership. That offer included pay raises of 3.5 percent to 4.5
percent -- an average of about 8 cents per hour plus a minimum fifth
week of paid vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Yngve Haagensen, leader of the powerful Norwegian Confederation
of Trade Unions, revealed on Monday that union representatives had
quietly been meeting employers throughout the strike. He said he
and other top leaders met secretly on Sunday evening to sketch out
a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the wage increases raised immediate fears of
pressure on the Norwegian economy, which is already booming on oil
wealth. The nation of 4.5 million people is the world's second
largest oil exporter.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affected road transport, some passenger ferries,
hotels, the construction industry and some private security
companies. It also has forced many newspapers, including the
nation's largest, to stop their printed editions because their
graphics staffs walked out.
</P>
<P>
   The strike could have forced tens of thousands of layoffs in the
European car industry, but the Norwegian news agency NTB said some
of the Norwegian parts makers were ready to start night shifts to
get back on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The union had threatened to increase the number of strikers to
more than 102,000 after 6 a.m. Tuesday. That would have made it
Norway's worst labor conflict since 1921, when 150,000 people
walked off the job over proposed pay cuts.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 103, 76ers 97  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose scored 30 points and the Indiana
Pacers, despite not making a field goal over the final seven
minutes, beat the Philadelphia 76ers 103-97 Monday night to take a
2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers scored their final 10 points on free throws, starting
with two by Rose that put Indiana ahead 95-73 with 5:53 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers rallied with a 33-14 run in the fourth quarter,
including scoring 17 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-seven series shifts to Philadelphia for Game 3 on
Wednesday and Game 4 on Saturday. Only seven teams in NBA history
have rallied from a 2-0 deficit to win a series.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson led the 76ers with 28 points, but was only
9-for-25 from the field. He had 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which trailed by as many as 26 points in the third
quarter, got within 95-88 when Iverson made two free throws with
2:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Rose made it 97-88 with 1:15 to play. Tyrone
Hill's layup made it 97-90, but he missed two free throws with 37
seconds to go. A free throw by Austin Croshere gave Indiana a 98-90
lead and a 3-pointer by Toni Kukoc made it 98-93.
</P>
<P>
   Rose then made one free throw with 18 seconds to go. After a
basket by Iverson, Reggie Miller made two free throws for Indiana
with 12 remaining and Rose sealed the victory by making two more
with 4.3 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere had a career playoff-high 20 points, including 4-for-4
from 3-point range, for Indiana, which pulled away as it shot 55
percent in the first half. Miller, who like Rose had 40 points in
Game 1, scored 19 and Rik Smits contributed 14 points on 7-of-9
shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson scored seven points but had 14 assists and also did
much of the defensive work against Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Hill added 15 points for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers went over six minutes without a field goal in the
second quarter. A jumper by Aaron McKie brought the 76ers within
42-33 with 6:47 left in the half. The 76ers, who shot 22 percent in
the second quarter, didn't get another field goal until Matt
Geiger's dunk in the final second of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led 55-40 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which swept the 76ers in the semifinals last year, came
out hot for the second consecutive game. The Pacers, who never
trailed, made 11 of their first 15 shots and the 76ers were unable
to match the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led 31-26 after one quarter and scored eight straight in
the first two minutes of the second quarter. All of the baskets
came up layups.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers, who were 4-for-19 from the field in the quarter,
missed their first six field goals in the period and later missed
eight consecutive shots as Indiana took its biggest lead of the
half, 53-35 with 2:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers fell behind by 26 when Croshere hit a 3-pointer with
4:08 left in the third quarter. Indiana shot 55 percent (12-of-22)
in the quarter and led 84-63 going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers began the final period with four reserves on the
court and the 76ers capitalized. Indiana returned its starters, but
went only 3-of-14 from the field in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Miller, who scored 16 points in the first quarter of Game
1, had 11 points in the opening quarter Monday. ... The Pacers
extended their streak of sellouts at Conseco Fieldhouse to 46. ...
Indiana made eight 3-pointers and is 19-for-42 from behind the arc
in the series. ... Croshere's previous high in the playoffs was 16
in the opening round against Milwaukee. ... Rose played 46 minutes
and Iverson played 45.

<HEADLINE> School Shooters Grandfather Let Go  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- The grandfather of a boy put behind bars
as one of the gunmen who killed five people at Westside Middle
School in 1998 was dismissed Monday as a defendant in a lawsuit
brought by victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Also dismissed was a company that made one of the guns used in
the shootings, Sporting Goods Properties Inc., formerly Remington
Arms.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge David Burnett said Andrew Golden's grandfather,
Doug Golden, should not be held liable for the shootings, as he had
taken precautions to keep guns at his house from getting into the
wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson broke into
Doug Golden's house and stole guns that were used in the shootings
on March 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug Golden did meet the test by locking his house and by
using the cable-lock system on the guns. I could not expect him to
do anything more than he did,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby McDaniel, who represents several members of the victims'
families, said he planned to appeal. McDaniel has argued that Doug
Golden was negligent in leaving the key to his firearms storage
system in plain view, attached to the gun rack itself.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining defendants are the younger Golden, now 13, and
Johnson, now 15, both in the custody of the state Youth Services
Division; Gretchen Woodard, Mitchell Johnson's mother; Scott
Johnson, young Johnson's father; and Dennis and Pat Golden, the
parents of Andrew Golden.

<HEADLINE> Golf Clubmaker Files Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Callaway Golf Co. has filed a lawsuit
against the Royal Canadian Golf Association over the launch of a
new driver that the association won't allow at its events.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in federal court in San Diego, claims the RCGA
unfairly and illegally interfered with the introduction of the ERC
forged titanium driver by ruling that it was non-conforming.
</P>
<P>
   ''A self-appointed ruling body cannot exercise its considerable
power over others in a way that is arbitrary, unfair and
unlawful,'' Steve McCracken, Callaway's chief legal officer, said
in a statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The RCGA's decision was made without any research on the driver
or discussion with Callaway, McCracken said.
</P>
<P>
   A message left after business hours Monday at the RCGA, based in
Oakville, Ontario, was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks an unspecified amount of damages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Golf Association has ruled that the ERC, with a loft of
11 degrees, is ''non-conforming.'' According to Callaway, the
driver is not marketed or sold by it in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Canceling BNFL Deal  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stung by soaring costs, the Energy Department
will end its contract with a British company for cleaning up the
radioactive waste now kept in underground tanks at the Hanford
weapons complex in Washington state, officials announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with BNFL Inc., a subsidiary of British Nuclear
Fuels Inc., had been in doubt since the company on April 24 said it
couldn't do the job for less than $15.2 billion. Two years ago,
when BNFL was hired the company estimated the cost at $6.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The skyrocketing costs leading to Monday's termination of the
contract represents a major blow to the Energy Department's efforts
to ''privatize'' complex nuclear waste cleanup projects. Under this
approach, companies would be hired to complete the project, assume
all risk and not be paid until after the work is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not giving up on the concept of privatization in
general,'' said Deputy Energy Secretary T.J. Glauthier. But he
added this approach would be limited to projects with fewer
uncertainties than the Hanford cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker said the department should have been prepared just
in case BNFL didn't work out. ''Today's announcement is alarming as
DOE still does not appear to have any credible back up plan in
place,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chair of the House Commerce
Committee. ''I urge the DOE to stop dragging its feet and wasting
taxpayer dollars on one of our country's top cleanup challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hanford, BNFL had agreed to design, build and operate a
high-technology plant that would turn 54 million gallons of highly
radioactive nuclear waste, now in 177 underground storage tanks,
into glass logs that in the future could be buried safely at a
government disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called BNFL's latest cost
estimate ''outrageously expensive and inadequate in many ways.''
Richardson previously had expressed concern about ''a disturbing
trend of unacceptable and unexplained budget escalations''
involving BFNL's Hanford project.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said that BNFL would continue some design work for
several months, but then the rest of the work -- from design to
construction -- would be turned over to other companies to be
selected by competitive bids. He said a decision on the new
contract would be made by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the payment to BNFL would probably be in the range of
$200 million to $300 million for the two-years of design work but
that he could not be more specific. It was not clear whether the
government would have to pay a penalty for ending the contract
although Glauthier said there was a provision for termination.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, BNFL expressed disappointment with DOE's action
but said it was ''pleased that the technology we have privately
invested in and matured will be the solution to the tank wastes.'
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier told reporters that the department stands by its goal
of having the plant completed by 2007 and the waste treatment
completed by 2018 although some short-term deadlines -- such as when
construction may begin -- may have to be put back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to cleaning up the Hanford site as rapidly as
possible,'' Richardson said in a statement. ''We should be able to
meet our long-term schedules for operating a waste treatment
plant.''
</P>
<P>
   BNFL was supposed to have completed 30 percent of the plant's
design work by now but less than that is completed, Glauthier said.
He said while the technical design of the plant so far appeared to
be sound, the department had serious concerns about the
''management and business approach'' taken by BNFL.
</P>
<P>
   BNFL is involved in other waste cleanup projects at Energy
Department facilities in Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina and
Tennessee. Last week, Richardson sent an independent review team to
BNFL's Sellafield facility in Manchester, England, to examine the
company's procedures and operations as they apply to its work in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That report has not yet completed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But DOE officials were clearly angry over the sudden price
escalation involving the Hanford project.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said BNFL will be allowed to submit a bid for the new
contract but he made it clear the company's chances may be slim.
''Why should we believe in their bid when we've just had this
experience? We've been pretty unhappy with their performance. ...
We're very disappointed to have to take this action and to have to
change directions now,'' he said.
