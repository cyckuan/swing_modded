<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Imports Decline Due to Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's imports have
decreased by 70 percent due to continuing decline of the rupiah
against the U.S. dollar, general chairman of the All-Indonesia
Importers Association, Amiruddin Saud, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesian imports, including capital, raw and auxiliary goods
needed by domestic industries, have decreased by about 70 percent
due to the monetary crisis," Saud said.
</P>
<P>
Imports have dropped from 2.5 billion dollars per month before
the crisis to 750 million dollars per month, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the fall in imports will not disrupt the
activities of the country's export-oriented industries in the
short term as they have stocks which they could rely on until
February.
</P>
<P>
"If the government is too slow to overcome the currency crisis,
domestic industries, such as the textile industry, might face
risks in the long run," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Food, beverage and cosmetic importers might also be put in an
unfavorable situation, he said, adding that producers plan to cut
their imports.
</P>
<P>
Saud called on the government to continue intervening in the
money market to overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government has 20 billion dollars worth of foreign
exchange, enough to import goods in the next five to six months.
</P>
<P>
The country's currency, the rupiah, stood at 3,865 to a dollar
on Monday. Several money changers however traded the dollar at
about 4,000 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against the U.S.
dollar since January this year following offshore speculative
attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies to hedge
their foreign borrowings.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) will continue its activities in Iraq after the WHO premises
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad were attacked by four unidentified
gunmen, a WTO official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The attack happened at about 7:30 p.m. local time on Saturday
when the gunmen disarmed the guards at the WHO office in Baghdad,
the organization's Deputy Director General Dr Fernando Antezana
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the gunmen then shot and threw hand grenades at the
houses, damaging several vehicles and and breaking house
windows. One of the four gunmen was accidentally injured during
the attack and was caught by Iraqi police. The other three fled.
</P>
<P>
There were no WHO staff in the compound when the attack erupted.
The Iraqi police investigating the incident suspected that the
attackers were "Iranian elements", the WHO official said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the WHO said that it will continue its
collaboration with the Iraqi Health Authorities in the
implementation of its regular cooperative health program with
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> NATO Discusses Bosnia Issue With Top Mission Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana together with NATO ambassadors today discussed the latest
developments in Bosnia with top officials of international
missions in a long session and in great detail.
</P>
<P>
At the session were International High Representative Carlos
Westendorp and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) chief representative Robert Frowick.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief told a post-session press briefing that the
Dayton peace process was moving forward as demonstrated by the
Bosnian municipal elections that went without a hitch on September
13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
He said that not only new local authorities would be
established but important decisions had been taken regarding the
local media as well.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, NATO-led multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR)
troops captured, at the requirement of Westendorp, four radio and
television broadcast transmission towers from the hands of
pro-Pale Bosnian Serbs and promised to hand them over to the
supporters of incumbent Republika Srpska President Biljana
Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
"These signifies that something is going to change on the
ground," said the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
The military alliance discussed the future of the SFOR at an
informal meeting of its defense ministers in Maastricht, the
Netherlands, on October 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
The NATO ministers reached consensus that NATO would skip the
scheduled 50-percent phase-out in the run-up toward next June when
the SFOR mandate expires.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to discuss and decide in December on whether
the SFOR stays in Bosnia after June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Solana stressed that the way Bosnian Serb paramilitary police
forces had been dealt with demonstrated the change on the ground
as well.
</P>
<P>
SFOR troops rounded up several pro-Radovan Karadzic police
stations and a police academy for illegally bugging the telephone
communication of Republika Srpska President Plavsic and hoarding
away such heavy weapons as bazookas.
</P>
<P>
Light and heavy weapons were confiscated from the police
stations on the grounds that they are not to be used for policing
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp told the press that the situation in Bosnia now was
a critical one as the international community was helping Bosnia
establish a pluralistic media.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of progress has to be done before we can assess for how
long the presence of NATO and non-NATO troops is necessary in that
country," said the international high representative who is
coordinating the civilian side of the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish diplomat likened Bosnia to a patient just coming
out of the life-support system but still in the intensive care
unit.
</P>
<P>
"The patient will survive but we don't know how long this
intensive care will be necessary," he added. "So for the time
being it is clear to us that the security environment created by
the SFOR is needed to stay even longer than June 1998."
</P>
<P>
Frowick expressed the appreciation of the OSCE for the support
of NATO and the integration of the SFOR with the OSCE to see to it
that the Bosnian municipal elections were safe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the OSCE did have a decision on preparing for the
Bosnian parliamentary elections slated for November 23.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE representative said that the patient did need the
attention, hinting that his organization needed the backup of
NATO-led SFOR troops just as they did at the previous elections.

TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today expressed the hope that Kim Jong II's formal
election as the general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea
will help improve relations between Japan and the Democratic

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi issued a statement,
saying that Japan cannot make immediate judgment if there will be
any change in DPRK's policies but will closely watch the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government will continue its efforts toward peace
and stabilization in the Korean Peninsula." Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
At deputy bureau chief talks in Beijing in late August, Japan
and DPRK agreed to resume ambassador-level talks for the

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Policy for Electronic Commerce Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
adopted a policy framework concerning security on electronic
commerce, especially transactions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The executive body of the 15-nation European Union has decided
to pass into law the network security framework in the first half
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The framework is aimed at ensuring the functioning of the
internal market for cryptographic products and services,
establishing a European framework for digital signatures and
stimulating a European industry for cryptographic services and
products.
</P>
<P>
Though rapid and efficient for worldwide communication
exchanges at low cost, open networks such as the Internet also
fall prey to such insecurities as intercepted and manipulated
messages as well as denied documents.
</P>
<P>
Encryption is necessary for electronic commerce because
consumers and financial institutions need to be confidant that no
one can tap into a transaction.
</P>
<P>
But the same encryption techniques can also be used by
terrorists, child pornographers or drug dealers to avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
Divergent legal and technical approaches in different
countries, however, constitute a serious obstacle to the formation
of the internal market of the 15-nation union by hindering the
development of new economic activities linked to electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said today that Europe is going to use,
unlike the United States, unlimited encryption even though the
technology can benefit criminals.
</P>
<P>
Though the policy paper did not specifically refer to the U.S.
global push for encryption, one commission official familiar with
the policy framework said that the plan can be rightly interpreted
in principle as a counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials argued that widespread availability of
encryption can also prevent crimes.
</P>
<P>
The damage caused nowadays by electronic crime, in the form of
industrial espionage, credit car fraud, toll fraud on cellular
phones and piracy on pay TV encryption, is estimated in the order
of billions of ECUs each year.
</P>
<P>
There are, therefore, considerable economic and legal benefits
associated with encryption, the officials said, adding that
restricting the use of encryption could well prevent law-abiding
companies and individuals from protecting themselves against
criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> Belarus to Develop Friendship With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MINSK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said here today that Belarus will always observe the
principle of developing friendship with China, no matter what the
international situation will be in the future.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko made the remarks when he met a delegation of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) headed by Tomur Dawamat,
vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the relations between Belarus and China,
Lukashenko said the two countries share a mutual stand on many key
international issues including the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The president said Belarus supports China's position on the
human rights and believed China had scored great achievement in
this field.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope for further boosting economic and trade
relations between Belarus and China.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat thanked Belarus for its support for China on many
international issues and hoped the two countries will promote
contacts and cooperation in various fields including politics,
economy, and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation's Belarus tour follows a good-will visit to
Estonia. It will leave for Finland, the last stop of the
three-country visit, this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: US Economy Still Threatened by Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan warned today that the current economic
expansion could be cut short if inflationary pressures emerge.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the U.S. House Budget Committee that inflation
remained the greatest threat to the current expansion which is now
in its seventh year and the third longest on record.
</P>
<P>
In a prepared speech, he said that the strong increases in
employment, which have pushed the U.S. jobless rate down to the
lowest levels in nearly a quarter of a century, may not last. It
may be only a matter of time until tight labor markets trigger
inflation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The law of supply and demand has not been repealed. If labor
demand continues to outpace sustainable increases in supply, the
question is surely when, not whether, labor costs will escalate
more rapidly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A re-emergence of inflation is, without question, the greatest
threat to sustaining what has been a balanced economic expansion
virtually without parallel in recent decades," Greenspan stressed.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also urged the U.S. Congress to aim for budget
surpluses to help cushion the impact of an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned against putting too much faith in views that rapid
increases in technology had spurred huge gains in productivity and
meant that the economy could grow much faster than previously
believed without generating inflation.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the House Budget Committee that it would be
prudent to aim for budget surpluses rather than just a balanced
budget in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed passed up the chances to raise interest rates
since March 25 when it increased the federal fund rate for
short-term bank lending by 1 quarter percentage point. However,
many U.S. economists believe the Fed will be forced to boost rates
to slow economic growth before the end of the year or in early
next year.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Cuts Budget Deficit as Move Toward Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has cut 0.5 percentage
points on its 1998 budget in a decisive move toward the single
currency Euro due to be launched in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The center-left government presented Tuesday its budget for
fiscal 1998 to the parliament, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene told parliamentarians
in his annual budget speech that Belgium is sure to join the
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
As the most deeply in-debt country among the 15 European Union
member countries, Belgium would cut budget deficit to 2.3 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) next year from 2.8 percent
currently, Dehaene said.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit by the budget slash of 17 billion Belgian francs
(469.3 million U.S. dollars) would be the country's pharmaceutical
industry as drug prices and dispensing fees will be curbed.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU Maastricht Treaty, the country's budget deficit
should be at or below 3 percent of its GDP to join the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Yet another Maastricht criteria caught Belgium off-balance.
The treaty required an eligible country should have its debt at no
more than 60 percent of GDP or approaching that level at a
satisfactory pace.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, however, now has a debt up to 125.1 percent of its
GDP, though the new budget plans to reduce it to 122.3 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government said that its budget targets had been
based on conservative forecasts for a 2.5-percent annual economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of Belgium's budget deficit has been the result
of more than a decade of revenue raising that has allowed the
government to avoid major new belt-tightening measures as the
country seeks to qualify early for the EMU.

<HEADLINE> Mulroney to Get 2-Mln Dlr Pay in Airbus Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney will get more than 2 million dollars (1.4 million
US dollars) from the present government to cover his legal
expenses in the Airbus affair, an arbitrator has ruled.
</P>
<P>
The ruling represents the last chapter in the landmark libel
suit between Mulroney and the federal government led by Prime
Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
Mulroney sued over the way he was named in a letter to the
Swiss government requesting help in an investigation by the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
</P>
<P>
He was alleged, among other things, to have received millions
of dollars in illegal commissions in return for helping the sale
of 34 Airbus jets to Air Canada in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The case was settled out of court in January, and the RCMP
began making payments to Mulroney before the arbitration process
had determined the final amount.
</P>
<P>
The RCMP must pay Mulroney 2,006,508 dollars, the federal
police said in a statement Tuesday night. The amount of interest
has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
The figure announced Tuesday means that the case will cost
Canadian taxpayers more than 3.4 million dollars, reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement could reawaken the criticism the present
government faced at the time of the court case, the reports noted.

<HEADLINE> 4 Israeli Soldiers Killed, 7 Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers were
killed and seven others wounded this afternoon when bombs were
detonated by guerrillas in southern Lebanon, Lebanese radio Voice
of People reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted sources of the South Lebanon Army (SLA),
Israeli militia ally, as saying that the bombs targeted an
Israeli convoy near the village of Markaba, about 500 meters from
the Israeli border in the Israeli-occupied enclave in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It said two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the same place by
bombs this morning.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate comment from Israel about the latest
incident in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, guerrillas today fired 25 rocket shells on
the Israeli and SLA's positions in the village, one of which hit
an Israeli target, causing a fuel tank on fire.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that Israeli troops and SLA militiamen
retaliated with artillery fire on several villages in the
central sector of the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Israeli warplanes were hovering at low
altitude in Saida, 40 kilometers from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas, including Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and pro-Syrian Shiite Muslim Movement Amal, are
fighting to oust Israel's 1,200 soldiers and the 2,500 SLA
militiamen from the region of 1,100 square meters in south
Lebanon occupied by Israel in 1985.

<HEADLINE> EU May Take Action Over S. Korean Car Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union, has been
considering taking action against South Korea for restricting
imports of foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
The consideration was prompted by complaints from the European
Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) which said in the
first half of 1997, new sales of European passenger cars in South
Korea declined by 33 percent to 2,284 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the European share of the South Korean domestic market
was an insignificant 0.51 percent, whereas South Korean car makers
like Hyundai and Daewoo have made inroads into the European
market, increasing their joint share by 38 percent to 253,000
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The ACEA complained that South Korea has joined the ranks of
industrialized economies and the sales of European cars in South
Korea reflect discrimination rather than just buying power or
consumer taste.
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt that these figures are the result of the
(South) Korean government's action to keep its market closed,"
said ACEA Secretary General Camille Blum.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of all the promises made by the (South) Korean
authorities even recently," he added, "to open their markets to
European passenger cars, it is even more closed than ever."
</P>
<P>
Under a 1995 trade agreement, South Korea agreed to certain
tariff, tax and regulatory reforms to pry open a car market where
imports are less than 1 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the Seoul government was blamed to have
reneged on some of its commitments and foreign exports to the
Asian country have remained negligible.
</P>
<P>
The ACEA complained that South Korea still has in place an
imposing array of cumulative tariff and tax disincentives that
disproportionately affect imports.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already put South Korea on its trade
watchlist because of its car policy.
</P>
<P>
European Commission officials are also examining wider
allegations of restrictive public procurement practices, fiscal
incentives for domestic suppliers, increased import duties and
restrictions on spending by South Korean tourists abroad.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes New Air Quality Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Asthma sufferers and
environmentalists in Europe today had a good tiding when the
European Commission decided to set new limit values for ambient
air quality.
</P>
<P>
Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and lead
are expected to be reduced from 10 percent to 50 percent as
health-based limit values for sulphur dioxide, lead and
particulate matter or dust will be met by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Health-based limit values for nitrogen dioxide and a tighter
set of limit values for dust will be met by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The major goal of the new set of limit values, based on the
revised air quality guidelines for Europe adopted by the World
Health Organization in 1996, is claimed by commission officials as
to provide a high level of protection for public health.
</P>
<P>
To meet the targets, emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
dioxide from tailpipes of cars and from industrial plants have to
be reduced by big margins.
</P>
<P>
Some industrialists fear that the sharp reduction of emissions
will inevitably entail heavy cost on the part of both car
manufacturers, car fuel producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
European cities have undergone several episodes of bad air
pollution during the past summer.
</P>
<P>
Paris authorities had to halve the traffic in and out of the
municipality to alleviate the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The main effects of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide
are on the respiratory function of human beings while dust is
found to be related to more asthma attacks and higher rates of
death from respiratory and cardiac diseases.
</P>
<P>
The most significant effect of ambient lead on health is
reduced IQ in children and an increase of neo-natal mortality due
to maternal exposure.

<HEADLINE> Kim Jong Il Becomes Chief of Workers' Party of Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Kim Jong Il, leader of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), today was formally
named general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the WPK Central Committee and the
Military Commission of the WPK Central Committee in a "special
report."
</P>
<P>
The report said that WPK members unanimously consider Kim Jong
Il as the great leader who has made the WPK strengthened and
become an all-conquering, experienced and long-tested
revolutionary party, which has won the absolute support and trust
from all people of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il's assumption of the post as general secretary of
the WPK is supported and recognized by all WPK members, it added.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 days of September and early October, WPK
grass-root organizations at all levels held meetings and adopted
resolutions unanimously naming Kim Jong Il as the party's general
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Since Kim Il Song, former WPK general secretary, passed away on
July 8, 1994, the top post of the WPK has been left vacant for
three years.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il, 55, is a member of the Presidium of the Political
Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, chairman of the Military
Commission of the WPK Central Committee, chairman of the DPRK
National Defense Commission and the supreme commander of the
Korean People's Army.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted Kim Jong Il's contributions to national
construction of the DPRK and the development of the WPK and the
army, especially the contributions made over last three years
after the death of Kim Il Song.
</P>
<P>
The report said that under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, the
DPRK people will surely overcome all difficulties and hardships
and win the final victory in building the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, a grand party was held on the Kim Il Song
Square in Pyongyang to celebrate Kim Jong Il's assumption of the
post as WPK general secretary.
</P>
<P>
The party was attended by Ri Jong Ok and Pak Song Chol, DPRK
vice presidents, Kim Yong Nam, vice premier and foreign minister,

<HEADLINE> EU Scrutinizes Formula One Television Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
confirmed that its competition officials have been scrutinizing the
25-year television broadcast deal by Formula One Holdings (FOH),
report said today.
</P>
<P>
Competition commissioner Karel van Miert made it clear that he
considers extremely long exclusive broadcasting contracts basically
anti-competitive.
</P>
<P>
The FOH is likely to be conferred with the 25-year exclusive
television rights by the International Automobile Federation, the
motor sport's worldwide governing body.
</P>
<P>
Yet FOH legal advisers reportedly believed that FOH's commitment to
maintaining unencrypted TV broadcasts of Formula One Grand Prix races
will be enough to fend off objections on competition grounds.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, received notification of the arrangement of the
deal under Article 85 of the EU Treaty which governs potentially
anti-competitive business pacts.
</P>
<P>
Bernie Ecclestone, Britain's international Grand Prix motor
racing guru, set up the FOH as the vehicle to bring the sport to
the world's television screens.
</P>
<P>
Ecclestone said that he would not go ahead with his planned
flotation of FOH on the stock markets until he has secured an
official exemption from normal EU competition rules.

<HEADLINE> David Andrews Appointed New Irish Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Berti Ahern
has appointed David Andrews as the country's new foreign minister
after former Foreign Minister Ray Burke resigned from parliament
Tuesday amid allegations.
</P>
<P>
Andrews, 61, will take over the co-chairmanship of the Northern
Ireland peace talks, which are aimed at finding a long-lasting
solution to the 28-year-old conflict in the region, according to
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Andrews, who served as foreign minister from 1992 to 1993, has
been defense minister of the new Irish government since July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Junior Defense Minister Michael Smith will replace
Andrews as the new defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Burke, who has been accused of accepting a 30,000 Irish punt
(about 43,700 U.S. dollar) political donation from an Irish
businessman in 1989, tendered his resignation following fresh
controversy over the granting of passports to an Arab banker in
1990.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Efforts on Water-related Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Department of
Humanitarian Affairs said today that it is time to focus on
socioeconomic impact of floods and drought and to prevent such
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The water-related disasters are affecting more people and
causing more damage than any other disasters, said the
Geneva-based DHA in a press release marking World Disaster
Reduction Day which falls on October, 8.
</P>
<P>
Desertification affects one fourth of the earth's land, and
costs 42 billion U.S. dollars each year in lost productivity,
according to the United Nations Development Program's 1996 Human
Development Report.
</P>
<P>
Poor land management practices are a major contributor,
including overgrazing (grazing areas account for 90 percent of
desertified lands), deforestation, overcultivation (leading to
erosion) and poor irrigation drainage.
</P>
<P>
While drought is the leading killer, with nearly 74,000
reported deaths in 1996, floods are the most frequent and cause
most economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Few countries are spared from floods, not even those in desert
areas. Even in Africa, where drought is the most frequent
disaster, floods and high-wind disasters rank second.
</P>
<P>
Floods in central, southern and northern parts of China from
late June to mid-August in 1996 took 2,700 lives and cost overall
losses of 26.5 billion U.S. dollars with 1.1 million houses
destroyed and 9.1 million damaged, according to the latest Munich
Reinsurance report on "Flooding and Insurance". This is the worst
flooding in the country in 150 years.
</P>
<P>
Many natural disasters are the result of unsolved development
problems, DHA points out. Development patterns that ignore
sustainable water management are exposing communities to greater
risks of floods and drought.
</P>
<P>
While floods between 1991 and 1995 caused nearly 203 billion US
dollars in losses, available water resources are declining at same
time when demand is rising.
</P>
<P>
Although much of the earth's surface is covered by water, DHA
explains, 97.5 percent is salt water, with little potential for
human use. The remaining 2.5 percent of fresh water supply is
mostly locked in polar icecaps, glaciers or groundwaters deep
under the earth.
</P>
<P>
Only a fraction of the world's freshwater supply, 0.26 percent,
is readily accessible from lakes, reservoirs and rivers. Yet even
from that amount, only one third can be harnessed for human needs.
</P>
<P>
World Disaster Reduction Day was launched by the U.N. General
Assembly in 1989, as part of the resolution creating the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-2000).
</P>
<P>
In a year in which the U.N. has chosen to assess the world's
water resources, the 1997 World Disaster Reduction Campaign
focuses on the need to build a "culture of prevention" to protect
these resources from disasters.

LUANDA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Post and
Telecommunications Licinio Tavares today urged the country's
entrepreneurs to be actively involved into the development of
Angola's post and telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the first
seminar on policy making of telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that Angola must set up its own stable and
efficient enterprises to break up the foreign monopoly of
Angola's post and telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
New policy for Angola's post and telecommunications sector
should be aimed at establishing high-quality and price-reasonable
networks of post and telecommunications all over the country to
meet the demands of social and economic development, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tavares added that to realize this goal, the participation of
domestic enterprises in the process must be beefed up while the
role of foreign investment should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will focus its discussions on the state of
Angola's post and telecommunications sector and revise its
development policy to serve the public better, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> FAO's TV Program to Help the Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations will put a TV and radio program on the
air this year to mobilize awareness and money in the struggle
against hunger, its Near East Regional Office said today.
</P>
<P>
An 11-hour TV and radio program shedding light on poverty,
malnutrition and hunger in the poorest areas in the world will be
broadcast to more than 50 countries by satellite from Rome, FAO's
headquarters, from 14:00 GMT on October 19 to 01:00 GMT the
following day.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first global telecast dedicated to mobilizing
awareness, solidarity and resources for a campaign to eradicate
hunger," FAO's regional information officer Michael Hage told a
press conference at the FAO's Cairo-based Near East Office here.
</P>
<P>
The idea of Telefood, a global telecast, is FAO's latest drive
to relieve the world's poorest countries of their acute food
shortage, said Hage.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the political commitment pledged by world leaders at
the World Food Summit in November 1996, FAO has decided to appeal
for financial contributions from countries, businesses and
individuals to support a practical action program.
</P>
<P>
All donations will go directly to FAO's Special Program for
Food Security, which helps poor farmers produce more food by
implementing such improvements as small-scale irrigation and
drainage.
</P>
<P>
The funds, to be collected through locally accredited banks,
will also be available for "grassroots" projects aimed at
assisting the rural poor in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
No funds will be diverted to administrative or other costs and
all contributions will go to providing practical support to the
people benefiting from the Special Program and grassroots projects.
</P>
<P>
Telefood will coincide with the celebrations of the World Food
Day on October 16, with the aim of heightening public awareness of
the problem of world hunger and focusing attention on agriculture
and food production.
</P>
<P>
It also comes when external assistance to developing countries'
agriculture by international donors fell sharply in recent years,
said Hage.
</P>
<P>
International assistance to agriculture in developing countries
fell to around 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 from nearly 16
billion dollars in 1988.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996 World Food Summit, participants from 186
countries pledged to reduce the number of undernourished people in
developing countries that tops 800 million.
</P>
<P>
FAO experts attending today's press conference pointed out that
one of the biggest challenges facing humanity is to feed a world
population expected to swell from 5.8 billion in 1997 to 9.4
billion by the year 2050.

<HEADLINE> Improvement of Postal Service Urged in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Postal
Organization today called for the improvement of the quality of
postal service in the country in the face of the rapidly changing
global environment.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark World Post Day which falls on October
9, the organizaiton said postal services must change with the
global communications market place that is growing more
competitive and diverse every day.
</P>
<P>
According to the organization, an annual total of 430 billion
letters circulate across the world with more than 6.2 million
dedicated postal employees and a network of 700,000 post offices
serving customers around the globe.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Post Day will be celebrated under the theme
''One World, One Postal Network''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a message issued by Thomas E. Leavey, Director-
General of the International Bureau of the Universal Postal
Union, in connection with the World Post Day pointed out that if
postal administrations do not improve quality of service to meet
customers needs, accept the present communications revolution as
a challenge rather than a threat, start exploring the advantages
of globalization and integrate new technologies, " competing
international postal services will take larger parts of their
core business-physical mail".

LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The world's first replacement
skin to be grown from human cells was launched by British and

</P>
<P>
The dermis named Dermagraft is made by seeding very thin

Dr Gail Naughton, the co-inventor of Dermagraft and president

incubated the cells in a medium similar to the environment in the
womb which gave them maximum potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
She said, "The breakthrough has been to understand what cells
do during the normal growth process. That enabled us to simulate
the conditions you would see in a normal growing child. Having
learned how to keep cells happy, the trick was to mimic the body's
environment in the laboratory."
</P>
<P>
Dermagraft is the first product in the range of fully human
engineered tissues. It has been designed to heal foot ulcers in
diabetic patients which are hard to treat. It was launched by
British Smith and Nephew and the US firm.
</P>
<P>
But as the scaffold can be made in any shape or size, other
parts of the body can also be made using the appropriate cells.

LUANDA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The power supply in the Angolan
capital will worsen as two sub-stations of Cambambe Hydropower
Station which supply power to Luanda will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Joao Armando, a spokeman for the Luanda Power Supply Company,
told reporters that the power supply will soon be reduced to 50
percent of the demand in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The generating capacity of Cambambe Hydropower has apparently
dropped because the severe shortage of rain and its power supply
to Luanda has reduced to 60 percent of its normal level, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of power supply is an problem of long standing in the

agricultural sector, which constitutes an important part of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by Minister of Agriculture, Natural
Resources and Environment Costas Petrides at the opening ceremony
of the 10th Agri-Fair, the Water Technology Exhibition and the
Machine and Tools Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Petrides said Cyprus' course toward the European Union (EU) of

<HEADLINE> Elf Considers Cooperation With China Fundamental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Elf-Aquitaine
considers its cooperation with China and other Asian countries
"fundamental" for its future development, said Philippe Jaffre,
president of Elf-Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Paris-based Chinese journalists today at
the Elf headquarters in Paris, Jaffre said that as a global
reaching enterprise and with a 1 billion dollar investment plan in
China, Elf wishes to fully establish itself in the Chinese market,
which has a huge potential in the development of oil, chemical and
health products.
</P>
<P>
He said that the forthcoming World Oil Conference to be held in
Beijing will be a very important meeting, which will exert a big
influence over development of oil exploration technologies and
coordination among world oil groups in marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
Jean Alliot, director of evaluation and programs of Elf, said
that Elf plans to continue its programs of exploration of oil
resources in China, and is now exploring the Tarim basin in
Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China.
</P>
<P>
When Chinese Premier Li Peng visited France in April 1996, Elf
and the Chinese group Sinochem renewed a crude oil supply contract
which covers 1 million tons of crude oil over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
Elf has signed two contracts with China to market its liquid
petroleum gas (LPG) in Xiamen and Haiyang, and a third is
currently under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also approved in August 1986 the
construction by Elf of a 40,000-ton marine and non-marine
lubricants blending unit in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Eric Painvin, director of Elf Oil Asia, Refinery and
Distribution, said that Elf is opening its first chain of oil
service stations in Henan Province of China, and plans to expand
its oil products marketing joint-ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
Elf's wholly-owned subsidiary, Elf Atochem, is investing 300
million U.S. dollars in 14 chemical projects in China, five of
which are already beginning to operate.
</P>
<P>
Elf is now running a dozen ventures in China, including the
Sanofi-Mingsheng Pharmaceuticals company in Hangzhou, the Decco
Agrochemicals company in Kunming, LPG-Haiyang oil refinery company
in Shandong, a hydrogen peroxide company in Shanghai, a
benzylchloride company in Wuhan, a petroleum products company in
Zhengzhou, a plastic additives company in Beijing, a lubricants
company in Guangzhou, and a plating company in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 40 projects have been established between
Elf and Chinese authorities or are under consideration, which is
expected to multiply Elf's sale in China by five times between now
and the year 2,000.

<HEADLINE> France Expects Concrete Measures From Israel-Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- France is expecting concrete
measures to be adopted by Israel and Palestinians at the summit
meeting held at dawn today between Yasser Arafat and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Such measures would allow both sides to relaunch the dialogue
which was disrupted after Netanyahu came to power in May 1996,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this meeting will lead rapidly to the proper
concrete measures for relaunching the implementation of the (Oslo
peace) agreements and restoring the confidence between the two
sides," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is good that contacts at the highest level
between Israel and Palestinians have been renewed.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting between Yasser Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu shows
that the climate in the Israeli-Palestinian relations tends to
improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu held their first meeting in eight months
to discuss some hot issues that are blocking the peace process --
the colonization of occupied territories by Jews, and the refusal
by Israel to withdraw its troops from Palestinian territories in
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government Warned of "2000 Crisis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's crucial public services
could be severely disrupted in 2000 unless the government takes
"urgent and aggressive action" to update its computer systems,
warned a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The computer repair task will cost the government at least 1
billion dollars (720 million US dollars), according to the 1997
report of the country's auditor-general.
</P>
<P>
If the task isn't completed on time, the computer systems could
fail when the new millennium falls, crippling vital services such
as search and rescue, commercial cargo clearance and unemployment
insurance payments.
</P>
<P>
At present, most computer software uses two digits, rather than
four, to denote years. The two-digit year in many computers rolls
over to "00" from "99."
</P>
<P>
Without expensive re-writing of software code, computer systems
aren't able to tell the difference between the year 2000 and 1900,
leaving them functioning erratically, it they work at all.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "2000 year crisis" has become a hugely
expensively problem for both the private and public sectors as the
2000 year approaches.
</P>
<P>
The report said now it may be too late for the government to
prepare all of its computer systems in time, which means it may
have to accept that less-important computer functions will
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
By late April, only one-third of the 50 government departments
it surveyed had finished laying out their plans for dealing with
the problem.
</P>
<P>
And only one department was able to show that it had begun
rewriting computer code, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Hussein: Israel Promises No More Attack in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein said here
today that Israel has promised him of carrying no more violent
attacks in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally, Hussein said he has secured promise
from Israel that the intelligence department of the Jewish state
would never conduct any violent actions again in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the pledge was made by the Israeli side during
a secret visit to Jordan by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon on September 29, four days
after Israeli agents' failed attack on Hamas leader Khaled
Mashaal in Amman.
</P>
<P>
During the visit aimed at solving the crisis, the Israeli
officials met Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan. Netanyahu has
expressed regret over the assassination attempt by two Israeli
Mossad agents and apologized to Jordan officially, Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the attack, he received letters from
inside Jordan, the Arab and Islamic world, Israeli personalities
and Jews worldwide denouncing the bungled attack on the Hamas
leader.
</P>
<P>
Before the king made the speech this afternoon, Hamas released
a statement, saying that it did not want to open dialogue with
Israel and it did not send any message to Israel for opening
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
However, Hussein said that two days before the attack, he sent
a letter to Netanyahu, telling him that there is a possibility for
a dialogue between Hamas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Israeli relations, which went strained by the
attack on Mashaal, were becoming normal after Israel began to
release Jordanian and Palestinian detainees and pledged to abide
by all the provisions in the peace treaty it signed with Jordan,
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a Hussein-brokered bargain after the failed attack, Israel
released long-jailed ailing Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of
Hamas, on October 1 and allowed him to return to his home in Gaza
in exchange for the release of the two Israeli Mossad agents who
attacked Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine. Most of its political bureau members
live in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is one of
the two Arab countries that conceived peace with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wheat Production to Drop Below 5-Year Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada's wheat production is
expected to drop 20.8 percent to 23.6 million tons this year due
to reduced planted acreage and lower yields.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada said today in its September production
estimates that of all the major crops surveyed, only canola,
soybeans and flaxseed were reported to show an increase in
production.
</P>
<P>
"Total wheat production has been adversely affected by both a
reduction of 2.4 million seeded acres this year and a yield
decrease of 5 bushels per acre," the federal statistics agency
said.
</P>
<P>
"Production will drop by 6.2 million tons this year -- 3.4
million tons below the five-year average," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Average yield for spring wheat in the Prairie provinces
declined by more than 5 bushels per acre.
</P>
<P>
Durum yield in Manitoba province dropped 11 bushels per acre
from last year, the lowest since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Though climatic conditions in Ontario province were more
favorable for wheat, reduced harvested area will lower production.
</P>
<P>
As for barley, production will fall by about 2.0 million tons
compared with last year. This represents the largest drop in
production since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Canola production in the country is expected to reach 6.1
million tons this year, up 19.6 percent than last year.
</P>
<P>
Soybean production will hit a record 2.7 million tons, up
22.7 percent than in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Seamen Complained at Maritime Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of qualified
seafaring personnel is one of the key problems facing the world's
shipping industry, an international shipping conference was told.
</P>
<P>
The interest of young people for a career at sea is
diminishing, said Vassos Pyrgos, Permanent Secretary of the Cyprus
Communications and Works Ministry, here today. But he did not give
detailed description of the situation.
</P>
<P>
He was making the complaints at the closing session of the
three-day Maritime Cyprus 1997 conference which was attended by
1,000 delegates from over 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
These problems, plus a general lack of welfare facilities and
uncertain social benefits, result in high labor costs, lower
quality, higher morbidity and labor unrest, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pyrgos said the good news is that international
instruments have been put in place to regulate the training,
working and living conditions, the social benefits and the welfare
of the seafarers.
</P>
<P>
Pyrgos urged all involved in the shipping industry, maritime
administrations, ship-owners, underwriters, port authorities and
seamen's organizations to combine their efforts to overcome the
existing problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference, which focused on the existing problems
in the industry, proved to be a "significant source of
information."
</P>
<P>
It provided "feedback and advice on the basis of which to
develop, review and adapt our maritime policy and direct our
actions," he added.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadians have increased their
consumption of vegetables by almost a quarter over the past two
decades, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, each Canadian ate almost 180 kilograms of vegetables,
up 22 percent from 147 kilograms 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Potatoes, the traditional favorite, led the way as consumption
reached almost 70 kilograms per person last year.
</P>
<P>
And lettuce, carrots, onions, tomatoes and cabbage also
remained popular with Canadian consumers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, total fruit consumption in Canada reached just over
120 kilograms per person, up 17 percent from the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
Bananas topped the list at over 13 kilograms per person,
followed by apples and oranges.
</P>
<P>
Canadians were also including more fish and shellfish products
in their diet, although red meat and poultry remained the most
popular choices for many consumers.

Lusaka, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official said
here today that the government intends to import 37 million U.S.
Dollars worth of maize to fill the demand gap caused by reduction
of output.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency quoted Ackson Sejani, Deputy Minister

the government intends to import about five million bags (90 kg
each) of maize to meet the shortfall from the expected output of
10 million bags of maize during the 1996-1997 agricultural
season.

On the same occasion, Edith Nawakwi, minister of the same
ministry, stressed that last season's floods and other factors
affected the whole Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)
region which has recorded a shortfall of 60 million bags in maize
production.
</P>
<P>
In view of the shortfall and the impending drought as a result
of the El Nino phenomenon during the coming season, Nawakwi said
the Zambian government has been compelled to import maize through
the food reserve agency and in connection with the private sector
and donors.

<HEADLINE> IMF Considers Assisting Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced today it will provide a financial rescue
package to Indonesia in the wake of a sharp fall in the value of
its currency.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to voice his support for Indonesia's economic
program, Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, expressed
his welcome to the Indonesian government's measures to respond to
the recent pressure in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last few months the IMF has been working closely with
the Indonesian authorities in developing an adequate response to
the crisis in Southeast Asia," Camdessus said. "The IMF strongly
supports the approach that has been followed by Indonesia, which
sees this as an occasion to strengthen its economic policies even
if fundamentals are basically sound," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief said it would send a team of experts to Jakarta
this week to work out details and would cooperate closely with
World Bank and Asian Development Bank teams already in the field.
</P>
<P>
The move was the latest by these international organizations to
help financially troubled Asian economies. The IMF and a group of
countries led by Japan provided Thailand with 17 billion U.S.
dollars in August, the second biggest rescue package after 50
billion dollars for Mexico in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also put together an aid package for the Philippines
early in the summer.
</P>
<P>
"Two IMF teams will arrive in Jakarta this week to begin
discussions on an IMF-supported economic program and to provide
technical assistance on financial sector reform," said Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
The value of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has lost 18.6
percent in the last two weeks, partly because of Thailand's
crisis. Since the beginning of the year it has lost 40 percent of
its value.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Praises Makerere University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has hailed Uganda's Makerere University for the
role it played in developing Uganda, east Africa and the
sub-Sahara region in general.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement today while giving a speech at the
university on its contribution to national and international
development to mark the 75th anniversary of the university.
</P>
<P>
The university, well known far and near in east Africa, has
trained and turned out many leaders and public servants during
the transition period from colonial administration to independent
government.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also praised the university for opening its door without
discrimination to all those who are qualified.
</P>
<P>
He contributed 10 million Shillings (about ten thousand U.S.
Dollars) to the university which is his Alma Mater for the
expansion of its library.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
briefed Mkapa on plans to expand the university and other Ugandan
institutions of higher learning to ensure that higher education
is accessible to all people in the country.
</P>
<P>
While the university could only admit 5,000 students in 1986,
Museveni said, it now caters for 15,000 and will be expanded to
enroll up to 20,000 in future.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Blames CIA for Libyan Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today denied Cairo was involved in the disappearance of a
prominent Libyan dissident in Cairo and put the blame on the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) instead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Suez Canal city of Ismailia today,
Mubarak dismissed as "random and baseless accusations" that Egypt
abducted Libyan dissident Mansour Kekhia in Cairo and then handed
him over to the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
A CIA report, quoted by the Washington Post on September 28,
said Egyptian agents staged the 1993 abduction. The alleged
kidnaping is reportedly causing tension between Cairo and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak suggested that the Jewish lobby in the United States
was behind the CIA report so as to avenge Israel's failure to get
back a convicted spy from Egyptian prison.
</P>
<P>
"The subject resurfaced because of Azzam Azzam," he said,
referring to the Israeli spy recently sentenced to 15 years in
prison on charges of spying on Egypt for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kekhia had served as Libyan foreign minister and ambassador to
the U.N. before defecting to the U.S. in 1980. He vanished from
the Safir Hotel in Dokki, west Cairo, on December 11, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he feared that the CIA had got Kekhia out of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"If there is fresh evidence on the subject, the public
prosecution in Egypt is ready to look into it," the president
said. But he added that it should be "of our own will and not as a
result of any pressure."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has long accused Libya of sponsoring global
terrorism. But Egypt is making efforts to have the United Nations
Security Council ease sanctions imposed on Libya since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wishes Erez Summit Will Get Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton hoped
today that a meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could put back on track
the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they met is encouraging," Clinton told reporters
at the White House. "The most important thing is that it occurred
and it occurred not a moment too soon."
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu met in the early hours today at Erez, the
Gaza Strip. It was their first meeting in eight months after the
peace process was disrupted by Jewish settlement building in March
which soon led to violent clashes between Palestinian protesters
and Israeli police and finally to two bombing incidents in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the turmoil of the last week, including a botched
Israeli assassination attempt on a Hamas leader, had created
conditions for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the developments of the last few days have been
so troubling and so difficult that it has gotten the attention of
both sides and clarified the necessity for them to get back to
talking with each other and to get this peace process back on
track, I hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted U.S. Middle East mediator Dennis Ross had played
an important role in arranging the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased Ambassador Ross was able to put it together," he
said. But he stressed at the same time that it was up to Arafat
and Netanyahu to "characterize the nature and results of the
discussions they had."
</P>
<P>
Ross, speaking in Ramallah, the West Bank, said today that he
believed the summit meeting at Erez marked a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very good meeting last night that I think does mark a
new beginning and it's especially important because the leaders
committed themselves to overcome all the differences," Ross said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met Israeli President Ezer Weizman in Washington
Tuesday and suggested the series of tragic events in the region
over the last several months might provide the impetus to revive
the peace process.

WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that his administration has witnessed the largest
decline ever in the country's welfare rolls, a drop of 3.6
million.
</P>
<P>
Clinton described it as "yet another piece of evidence that
welfare reform is working far better than anyone had predicted it
would." The decline also has been attributed to the nation's
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first 10 months of the new law, through
June 1997, welfare rolls declined by 1.7 million to just under
10.5 million. For the first time since 1969, less than four
percent of the U.S. population is on welfare.

Clinton called on businesses to take advantage of available tax
credits to hire workers off the welfare rolls.

WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 61.2
million U.S. dollar loan to the Dominican Republic for the first
phase of its health improvement program.
</P>
<P>
The resources will finance investments in technical assistance,
training, service provision, infrastructure and equipment that
will support institutional and service delivery reforms to improve
health care for low- and middle-income citizens.
</P>
<P>
The social insurance-financed health system will be modernized,
separating the pension, accident, and health funds and
establishing a system in which insured families select a provider
network among a menu of competing networks.
</P>
<P>
Besides, four public hospitals will be upgraded and become
autonomously governed, model facilities employing modern
management tools and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Two pilot projects will be financed to provide basic health
service, including insurance, to low-income groups.
</P>
<P>
Co-financing for the IDB program is being offered by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with 5 million
dollars and the Nordic Development Fund, with 3.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to help carry out the first five years
of health reform expected to take between eight to 12 years.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frderick Sumaya today called on residents in the capital Dar es
Salaam to keep the environment clean.
</P>
<P>
"Our city is filthy, " he said, adding that residents
therefore have to cooperate with the city commission to improve
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Premier Sumaya, on a tour to the Makumbusho modern trading
center in the city, urged traders and food vendors to keep their
stands clean.
</P>
<P>
Traders are to supposed to be in the forefront of the
cleanliness campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the government's decision to extend the Dar
es Salaam city commission's tenure for another two years, noting
that the move is aimed at improving services of the city.
</P>
<P>
He promised the government would not hesitate to sack
"indisciplined official of the commission" to restore people's
faith in the government.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Premier said the government is
studying the constitution to see if there is a need to amend some
chapters.
</P>
<P>
He invited people, including members of parliament from the
Opposition to contribute ideas to amend the constitution which
has so far been amended for 11 times.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Facilities Affects Ghanaian Varsities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two-thirds of candidates
in Ghana who qualified for entry into universities now cannot get
in because of inadequate accommodation and teaching facilities.
</P>
<P>
For some universities, they each could only accept about 1,400
fresh men and women while more than 5,000 are actually qualified,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been getting worse each year with the growth
of the population, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, everyone agrees that more
universities should be established or existing facilities
expanded, but hardly anyone seems to have a clue as to how to
finance them.
</P>
<P>
The government policy has been to spend comparatively more on
primary education in order to achieve good quality, nearly free
basic education for all children and for parents to share the
cost of secondary and higher education.
</P>
<P>
But the National Union of Ghana students say their parents are
broke and cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone believes that, saying that hundreds of students
are travelling to Europe and America during their holidays while
enjoying music from hifi equipment in their home.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's education minister was quoted as arguing that many
parents spent much more to send their children to private primary
schools than they were being asked to pay at universities.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the government expects that secondary school
graduates who are able to enter university to pursue vocational
and technical careers.
</P>
<P>
But that's not an appealing option especially for those who
have made the university entry grades. They don't want to settle
for mercenary when they can be architects or for book-keeping
when they can be fund managers.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the educational system are particularly upset
because of reports that several ministers and presidents have
sent their children to universities overseas.
</P>
<P>
They say it demonstrates a lack of faith in the government's
own education system, while government counterargue that their
children have a right to be educated anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted the fund problem would become the number
one question for Ghana's university entrance examination next
year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Washington Talks Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- an originally scheduled
Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Washington next week to seek ways
of revitalizing peace process has been postponed as time available
is too short for lengthy discussions, the State Department said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that the
U.S.-sponsored talks between Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
and Mahmoud Abbas, a senior advisor to Yasser Arafat, would have
had only two day to meet because the major Jewish holiday Succot
begins at sundown next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And a summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Arafat at Erez, Gaza Strip,
earlier Wednesday also gave boost to "shake up" the schedule for
the originally planned Washington meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be able to have them (Levy and Abbas) stay longer
than two days," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The four issues to be discussed between Levy and Abbas are
those of further redeployment of Israeli forces in Palestinian
areas, a time-out in new Jewish settlement construction, ways to
advance to negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians on
the final "permanent status", and security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Talks on those issues "will continue at various levels through
our normal channels and then a schedule will be developed for
further discussions," Rubin said. "The focus of attention should
now be on the interim committees" looking at the use of
Palestinian airports and seaports and on safe passage between the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the interim committees and next week's
Washington talks were agreed during talks in New York between
Israeli and Palestinian officials on September 29.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanctions Won't Hurt S. Leone: Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone said today that sanctions ordered by the United Nations
Security Council would not affect the country.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions would only "hurt the poor" instead of the
military government, said a junta spokesman, quoted by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided earlier today to impose sanctions
on the military junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution which was unanimously adopted this morning,
the Security Council called on all states to prevent the entry
into or transit through their territories of members of the
military junta and adult members of their families.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on all states to prevent the sale or
supply to Sierra Leone, by their nationals or from their
territories, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, of
petroleum and petroleum products and arms and related materials
of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles
and equipment, paramilitary equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the military junta to immediately hand over
power to the democratically-elected government it overthrew in
the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the military junta must end all acts of
violence and cease all interference with the delivery of
humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Similar measures were taken by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) more than a month ago to press the junta
to step down.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions and and embargo ordered by ECOWAS has
been enforced by the sub-regional peace-keeping force known as
ECOMOG, which has warned to attack any violator.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution, which ECOWAS has been
seeking, also expressed strong support for the efforts of the
ECOWAS committee of five to resolve the crisis in the country and
encouraged it to continue to work for the peaceful restoration of
constitutional order, including through the resumption of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The committee is made up of foreign ministers of Nigeria,
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The council called on all states, international organizations
and financial institutions to assist west African states to
address the economic and social consequences of the influx of
refugees from Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Agree on Meeting at Arab League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The main Somali factions today
agreed to meet at the Arab League (AL) headquarters in Cairo this
month in a bid to end the country's seven-year civil war, a senior
AL official said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting aims to pave the way for a national
reconciliation conference slated for Bosaso, south of Somali
capital of Mogadishu, on November 1, said Samir Hosni, who is in
charge of the Somali file in the AL.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the factions have already accepted the proposal
by AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid on holding a
preparatory meeting here to narrow their differences regarding the
main issues to be raised in the national reconciliation
conference, Hosni said.
</P>
<P>
There is full coordination between the AL and the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry towards the necessity of helping the Somali
factions to overcome their crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting will be attended by leader of the Somali
Salvation Alliance Ali Mahdi Mohamed and leader of the Somali
Congress Party Hussein Farah Aideed, together with a number of
Somali National Salvation Council leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed and Aideed signed a reconciliation agreement here on
May 29 on holding peaceful talks to end the civil war that has
ravaged the country since 1991. Egypt has been involved in
mediating an end to the Somali crisis in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is currently coordinating efforts with the
U.N. and the Organization of African Unity as well as major
countries in the area such as Egypt and Ethiopia to activate the
Somali reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late President Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their spheres of
influence despite several unsuccessful peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 posts will be
reduced by the end of November in Zambia's Ministry of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, the official Zambia News Agency
Zana reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zana quoted the ministry's Permanent Secretary Kabeta Muleya
as saying here today that only 4,000 staff will be given jobs by
his ministry after November 30.
</P>
<P>
This is apparently a bold move to promote the efficiency of
the ministry and reduce the red tape, which is a common case in
the administrative departments of the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, the ministry has more than 7,000 employees, all of
whom have applied for the existing 4,900 vacancies, said Muleya.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a committee comprising of non-civil servants
appointed by the country's public service commission has been
conducting interviews and reviewing the experience,
qualifications and the personality of the candidates for the
positions.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the panel is such that the people in the
team have no attachment to the ministry's current staff in case
they swerve the rules and recruit people who are not qualified
for the positions, the secretary noted.
</P>
<P>
There is no overwhelming response from the ministry's
employees, said Muleya, adding it is a pity that many qualified
people will not be accepted because of the limited vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Those who will not be picked by the ministry will be told of
their new status soon and their pensions and other terminal
benefits will be addressed by the cabinet office through civil
service management division, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under zambia's labor law, employees cannot be fired unless
they are compensated with a large sum of "terminal benefits".

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide Guarantees for Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- To beef up Egypt's burgeoning
private sector, the World Bank (WB) today announced a new strategy
to shield private investors from any loss from the breach of
contract by the government.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Ikram, director of Egypt Department at the World Bank,
said that the bank will sign written guarantees by which it will
pay back any loss the private sector might incur if the government
backtracks from having it carry out infrastructure ventures.
</P>
<P>
"The bank has taken such decision due to the courageous
economic steps taken by Egypt that helped both sides reach a high
level of confidence," Ikram said on the sidelines of symposium on
the participation of the private sector in infrastructure projects
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Investments of infrastructure projects in developing countries
reach 250 billion U.S. dollars, 15 percent of which are private
sector investments, according to Nemat Shafiq, head of Private
Sector Development Department at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
She said Egypt has given the private sector a much free hand by
letting them carry out infrastructure ventures, especially in the
fields of power, airport and harbors.
</P>
<P>
Shafiq pointed out that competition forces the private sector
to improve the quality of the services and enhance their
accessibility to all classes of projects..
</P>
<P>
"When the private sector implements such projects, the state
will receive more taxes and wages of workers will be improved,"
she said, adding that some of them will even be share-holders in
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government's privatization policy was launched in
1991 but actually took off in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By June 1997, nearly 22 percent of the public sector had been
offered for sale in Egypt, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Participation of the private sector represented 60 percent of
the volume of economic activities in Egypt by 1995, a 50 percent
rise over the 1970s. The private sector is expected to shoulder 70
percent of the country's investments in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Identifies "Terrorist" Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Wednesday identified 30 foreign groups as "terrorist"
organizations, making it illegal to provide funds for them and
denying their members or representatives U.S. visas.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the move mandated by a 1996 U.S. law, Albright
said the goal of the designation was to "make the United States
fully a no-support-for-terrorism zone."
</P>
<P>
The 1996 law was approved following the Oklahoma City bombing

responsible for the bombing turned out to be U.S citizens
</P>
<P>
Upon the announcement, President Bill Clinton said in a
statement during a political trip in New Jersey that "the United
States is committed to fight against those who speak the language
of terror."
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the House, impatient over the slow pace of
identifying the "terrorist groups", voted 396-6, to cut State
Department salaries and expenses by 2 percent until the list was
completed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign groups named as "terrorist" organizations include
the Islamic resistance organization Hamas, the Basque group ETA,
the Hezbollah organization, the Khmer Rouge, the Kurdistan
Workers' party, and Peru's Shining Path and Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that although the
IRA was not included in the list, the United States intended to
keep it "under active review." The designations expire in two
years' time unless renewed, but groups could be added to the
list in future, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. 1996 Foreign Military Aid Near $9 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government provided
872 million U.S. dollars of military supplies to foreign nations
and regions in 1996 and approved another 270.5 million dollars in
cut-rate sales of used U.S. defense equipment, the Defense News
said in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to cultivate global influence, the U.S.
defense aid covered more than 120 countries and regions, spanning
the globe, from Eastern Europe and Bosnia to the Middle East and
Central America, the military weekly said, citing a White House
report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East was the biggest recipient with 388.8 million
dollars, followed by Europe, 246 million dollars, and Latin
America, 109.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The outright grants to the Middle East mainly went to Egypt,
Jordan and Israel, while Bosnia was the largest recipient of
emergency drawdown equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Pentagon gave away 495 million
dollars in excess defense articles (EDA), equipment determined no
longer to be needed by U.S. military, including M60A3 tanks, M16
rifles, M113 armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
Also it gave away 338 million dollars worth of equipment
through emergency drawdowns, which was Congressionally mandated
assistance in the form of defense items taken from U.S. military
stocks, and 39 million dollars in International Military
Educational and Training funds.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the U.S. gave away about 154 million dollars in
EDA in 1994 and about 138 million dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Says He Opposes Failed Murder Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said today that if he had known about the failed murder
attack by two Israel agents on a Hamas leader in advance, he would
have opposed it.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Radio, he said that he would
have made his position clear to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
if he had known the operation beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Levy refused to comment on the prime minister's role during the
affair or the decision-making process, which led up to the
operation.
</P>
<P>
But he said that if he had been one of the decision-makers
involved in the affair, he would have not let the operation get
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
The failed attack on Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Amman late
last month has caused serious damage to Israel, Levy said. He
warned that he will resign if he reaches conclusion that he can no
longer have impact on or improve the government performance.
</P>
<P>
The bungled attack forced Israel to release Hamas founder
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and allow him to return his home in the Gaza
Strip in exchange for the release of the two agents carrying out
the attack and detained by Jordanian police.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, the Canadian government recalled its
ambassador to Israel to protest over the misuse of Canadian
passports by the two agents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Mossad Director Nahum Admoni resigned today
from the state committee of inquiry, which is in charge of
investigating the Mashaal affair. And his resignation was
approved by the Israeli cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said that Admoni
had to step down because of his recent statement defending the
failed operation in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's office announced that it is proposing
former Air Force Commander Dan Tolchovsky to replace Admoni.

<P>
KATHMANDU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa said here today that priorities of his government
include restoring law and order in the country and consolidating
the liberal economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in the Lower House, the new prime minister said
his first priority is to protect the life and property of the
people and free the country and the people from the dark shadow of
violence and terror.
</P>
<P>
A campaign to this end will soon be launched effectively, Thapa
said.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 Nepalese have died in the movement launched since
February 1996 by the ultra-leftist guerrillas under the name of
"People's War".
</P>
<P>
Another important responsibility of the government is to
consolidate the liberal, competition-oriented economy, Prime
Minister Thapa said.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to utilize the skill,
entrepreneurship, capital and managerial expertise of the private
sector to the maximum possible extent in the country within the
liberal economic structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue the process of strengthening
industry, commerce, tourism and banking facilities and encourage
private and foreign investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will also consolidate the self governance
through decentralization of powers, means and resources, the new
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Thapa won a vote of confidence in the Lower House today. It is
just three days after he took over as head of a new coalition
government.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees More Vehicle Sales in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's consumer demand for new
motor vehicles registered a record high in August as more
automobiles were sold than during any other months since the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today indicate that consumers bought a
total of 120,866 new cars and trucks in August, a 2.8 percent
increase from the previous month and a 21.1 percent rise over the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1996, sales of new motor vehicles in the country have
generally been on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
Even though the current sales levels are the highest since the
early 1990s, they remain below the levels reached in the late
1980s, the federal statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Between January and August this year, dealers sold 915,941 new
vehicles in all, the highest eight-month total since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The strong sales performance is generally attributed by the
industry to improved consumer confidence, modest job growth and
lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In addition, leasing has been a major factor in the sales of
new vehicles, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denies Any Criticism of Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today rejected media reports that President Yasser
Arafat criticized Jordan for its release of two alleged Israeli
agents.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath described the reports talking such a criticism as
groundless, Jerusalem Media and Communication Center said.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, Jordan released two alleged Israeli agents for
attempting to kill Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)'s leader
Khaled Mashaal in Jordan last month.
</P>
<P>
The reports published today quoted Arafat as telling a secret
meeting in Ramallah Wednesday that "there is a conspiracy to
undermine the PNA."
</P>
<P>
He was reported to have accused Jordanian King Hussein for
forming "an alliance with Hamas against the PNA" by freeing
Israeli agents in exchange for Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Some other reports even said that Arafat in his address had
alluded a plot involving Israel, the United States, Jordan and
Hamas to bypass the PNA to speak for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
All these reports were groundless and Arafat criticized nobody,
Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Cabinet is scheduled to convene its
weekly session in Ramallah Thursday evening to discuss the latest
political developments in light of the recent meeting between
Arafat and Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu met on Wednesday morning at Erez
checkpoint between Jerusalem and Gaza, in which the two tried to
find out their differences concerning the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first between the two Israeli and
Palestinian leaders since March when the peace process sank in
crisis with the start of Israeli construction of settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PMs Pledge to Hold Elections As Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Ministers Ung
Huot and Hun Sen said here today that Cambodia will hold general
elections in May 1998 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The elections can proceed as scheduled as long as various
parties make joint efforts, said the two prime ministers when
addressing a press conference held at Phnom Penh's Pochentong
International Airport upon return from their diplomatic trip to
France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government welcomes exiled political figures
abroad to return home for the scheduled elections next year, said
Ung Huot and Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
As for whether the ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh can run in the elections, Hun Sen said Ranariddh has the
right to campaign so far, but his future hinges upon the verdict
of court.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who has been in exile since he was ousted in July,
was accused by Hun Sen of illegally negotiating with Khmer Rouge
guerrillas and of possible involvement in illegal import of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's draft election law, now in parliamentary committee,
holds that convicted criminals may not stand as candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also complained about the decision of the United
Nations to leave vacant Cambodia's seat at the 52nd General
Assembly. But he believed this matter, which he said concerns the
role of the U.N. in Cambodia, will be solved soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today pledged further financial support to help Thailand
rebuild its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the pledge during a 45-minute meeting with his
visiting Thai counterpart Chavalit Yongchaiyudh at his official
residence, Kyodo News quoted government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Overcoming difficulties for the Thai economy is not something
that involves Thailand alone, and is important for recovering
trust in the whole economy of Southeast Asia," Hashimoto was
quoted as telling Chavalit.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto asked Thailand to steadily implement its economic
rehabilitation package and work out measures which can gain the
confidence of the market and steadfastly carry them out, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In a response, Chavalit said that Thailand will comply with
agreements in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) package
although they are difficult for the country, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Japan offered two new types of trade insurance, which were
worth 1 billion U.S. dollars in total, over two years to increase
funds supply of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Japan contributed 4 billion dollars in loans to a 17.2 billion
dollar package devised recently by the IMF to rescue Thailand from
its economic crisis, which stemmed from the plunge of the baht
against the dollar in July.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chavalit, who arrived here Wednesday on a
three-day visit, promised to improve his country's investment
environment to attract more Japanese investment.

<HEADLINE> Italian Dramatist Wins 1997 Nobel Literature Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 Nobel prize for
literature goes to Italian dramatist and actor Dario Fo, the
Swedish Academy announced here today.
</P>
<P>
As one of the leading figures in modern farce and political
drama, Dario Fo "emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in
scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden,"
said the Academy.
</P>
<P>
Fo has been performed for many years all over the world and his
influence keeps increasing.
</P>
<P>
"With a blend of laughter and gravity, he opens our eyes to
abuses and injustices in society and also the wider historical
perspective in which they can be placed," said the Academy.
</P>
<P>
The jury described Fo as "an extremely serious satirist with
multifaceted works."
</P>
<P>
Fo's main works include "Mistero Buffo" in 1969, "Accidental
Death of an Anarchist" in 1970, "We Can't Pay We Won't Pay!" in
1974 and "Trumpets and Raspberries" in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, Fo has been engaging in women issues
in several plays together with his wife.
</P>
<P>
"His strength is shown in the creation of texts which amuse,
engage and provide perspectives simultaneously," the Academy
said. "His oeuvre is of impressive artistic vitality range."
</P>
<P>
Born in 1926, Dario Fo received education in Academy of Arts in
Milan. And, his wife Franca Rame is also an actress and writer.
</P>
<P>
Each Nobel prize winner this year can get some 7.5 million
Swedish kronor (about 1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nobel prize was founded in the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swede
who invented dynamite and died in 1896. The prizes, along with
diplomas and gold medals, are presented to winners every year on
December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Satisfied With Foreign Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials are generally
satisfied with the overall performance of overseas-funded
businesses in China, according to a survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the public opinion research institute
under the People's University of China, was based on interviews
with 100 local and central officials and experts from policy study
institutes.
</P>
<P>
It focused on the current situation of overseas-funded
enterprises in the electronics industry and telecommunications
facilities manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the respondents were satisfied with those
overseas-funded businesses' investment scale and their co-operation
with local businesses, said Liu Xiayang, deputy director of the
research institute.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five of them share the view that overseas-funded
businesses should promote the import of technologies, which is of
critical importance to China's economic development at present.
</P>
<P>
The respondents also agreed that such businesses should further
improve their images in China by increasing investment, importing
more technological expertise and employing more Chinese natives as
their administrative personnel.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that "high-quality products",
"willingness to import advanced technology and management
expertise", "credibility", "large scale investment" should be the
major requirements for the most satisfactory overseas-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the general performance of eight major
overseas-funded electronics and telecommunications enterprises in
China, the respondents put Motorola at the first place.
</P>
<P>
"Although only 100 people were interviewed in the survey, their
views reflected China's work of foreign economic co-operation over
the past decade," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last June, China had approved more than 290,000
overseas-funded businesses, ranking second in using large amount
of overseas funds for four consecutive years, next only to the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Fruit with Medfly Barred Out of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Quarantine officials at the
Beijing Capital Airport have seized some fruit bearing 28
Mediterranean fruit flies (medfly) carried by a foreign diplomat
to China, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that China has intercepted a big amount
of medflies hidden in fruit taken by a foreign embassy staff sent
to Beijing, said Yu Dahai, director of the Quarantine Bureau on
Animals and Plants under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Capital Airport, the largest in China, has captured
medflies hidden in fruit carried by passengers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Medfly, rated as the No. 1 killer of fruit, has spread to
more than 80 countries and regions, causing a direct economic
loss of tens of billions of US dollars. Therefore, many countries
have listed medfly on top of the destructive insects and strictly
forbid importing fruit from affected areas.
</P>
<P>
China is a bid agricultural state as well as large fruit
producer in the world. Once the insect is brought into China, it
would harm not only China's fruit production but also its fruit
trade with other countries, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has not found a single case of medfly, African
hog cholera or mad cow disease as a result of a series protective
measures taken in the past decade and more, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Owing to interception of medfly at ports of entry on four
occasions, China will improve quarantine management of imported
farm produce, strictly control grain and meat import and prohibit
importing animals and products from countries with mad cow
disease and mouth-feet disease, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country will tighten quarantine inspection on
goods, postal articles and packing materials carried by passengers
who come to China, he added.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), stressed
here today the importance of China's growth and stability for Hong
Kong while urging the local businessmen to build Hong Kong into a
more prosperous region.
</P>
<P>
The strong and continued growth and stability of China is
fundamental to the prospects of Hong Kong, Tung said at a luncheon
hosted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce today, one
day after he made his first policy address.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that China's economic reform and opening up to the
world, which has been in progress successfully for almost 20
years, is a process that warms the hearts of all the people, and a
process that has given Hong Kong great opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of the development in China, and the fact that we
have an unmatchable location as a gateway to the south, gives us a
natural competitiveness advantages," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"But we can not take it for granted that location alone will
ensure our prosperity," he added.
</P>
<P>
While the world economy is becoming increasingly open,
increasingly competitive, and ever more integrated through
information technology, Hong Kong has to embrace the new
technology and hone its competitiveness to keep it advantage, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
But although constant change and improvement is needed in a
competitive market economy, stability is also essential, Tung
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sound policies, consistently followed and managed openly and
honestly, are the basis for trust and confidence, which has been
one of Hong Kong's great competitive advantages.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong needs qualified, creative, motivated people to
upgrade its economy to meet the challenges of tomorrow, Tung
said. Therefore, the quality of Hong Kong's education system is of
great importance, he added.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will be investing billions of dollars in
information technology in schools, not simply to teach children
how to use these vital tools, but to improve the teaching and
learning environment so as to stimulate creativity, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"By our investment in people, information infrastructure and
physical infrastructure; by sound long term planning, and by close
attention to the efficiency of regulation and Government activity,
we will give you the tools, the framework and the freedom to
build Hong Kong into a truly great city," Tung concluded.

recent price hikes, indicating that Germany's economy is

<P>
BONN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said here today that Mexico is a "ideal partner" for
Germany to seek closer cooperation with the Latin American region.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico is a door for the German industry to Latin America, as
well as the United States and Canada. Meanwhile, Germany is Latin
America's door in the European Union and the bridge to Central and
Eastern Europe," said Kinkel during a meeting here today with
visiting Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also hailed the investment promotion and protection
treaty initialed by the two sides Wednesday as an extremely
important step in the relations between the two countries.

"It will make Mexico an even more attractive investment
location for small- and medium-sized German enterprises," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders also expressed satisfaction with the signing of a
framework agreement on technical cooperation on Wednesday and said

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Official Proposes to Set up International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia was today proposed
to set up an international news agency to help further enhance
the country's image throughout the world, Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made in Parliament today by Ruhanie Ahmad, a
government backbencher, during the debate on the Bernama
(Amendment) Bill 1997 which was tabled today suggesting for the
withdrawal of the exclusive rights of Bernama for the distribution
of foreign news in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Ruhanie said an international news agency owned by Malaysians
could help the government respond to attacks by the foreign media
which was bent on discrediting Malaysia's image.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on his proposal for the setting up of the
international news agency, Ruhainie said "Such an agency can have
smart partnership with Third World news agencies. This is one way
of freeing ourselves from the clutches of the Western media and
western media capitalists."
</P>
<P>
He said such an agency could be easily set up, as the local
media had their respective representatives overseas.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that all media companies and Malaysian investors
pool their financial resources and energy to set up the Malaysian
International News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tabling the Bernama (Amendment) Bill, Malaysian
Deputy Information Minister Suleiman Mohamed said that following
the unlimited entry of information and the creation of the
Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), the government would not impose
any form of censorship on the flow of information.
</P>
<P>
He said the free flow of information was vital for the creation
of a well-informed society which could help in the overall
progress of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that rapid changes were taking place in the field of
information technology at present, rendering it impossible for
news to be channeled as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Bernama was set up under the Bernama Act 1967 which was amended
in 1990 to grant exclusive rights to Bernama to receive news
material from foreign news agencies and other organizations
dealing with news for distribution in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
With the present amendment, foreign news agencies could market
their services directly to subscribers in Malaysia or have
agreement with Bernama to market their products in this country.

mayor of Zhongshan city was given a special award for his
contribution to human settlement work by the United Nation here

</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the local government has input some 900 million

million sq.m..
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Reviews Policy on Foreign Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
reviewing the policy on foreign direct investment (FDI) with a
view to removing some of the ambiguities in the existing policy on
foreign companies buying into Indian companies, an official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at checking hostile takeovers of successfully
run Indian companies by their foreign competitors. This follows
the controversy over the British chemical and paint major ICI
PLc's purchase of 9.1 percent stake in India's Asian Paints.
</P>
<P>
The British multi-national company's deal struck in the
secondary market to pick up the stake of one of the four promoters
of Asian Paints is strongly opposed by the other three promoters.
</P>
<P>
The review would not only define hostile takeovers, but also is
intended at blocking hostile takeovers of successfully run Indian
companies, the same official said.
</P>
<P>
"We want foreign companies to bring in technology and
investments, to create jobs and wealth. In the specific case of
ICI PLc, they fit into neither of the four categories," the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Session of the Sino-US
Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Wu Yi and US Secretary of Commerce William Daley co-chaired the
closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Daley expressed their belief that Sino-US commercial
cooperation will achieve greater success as a result of the
forthcoming historic summit between Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and US President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the session added a new page to the JCCT which is
the most important arena for commercial dialogue between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the two nations will join their
efforts to advance the promising Sino-US commercial relations into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the two sides reached a series of important
agreements which will enable the JCCT to handle and solve a
greater number of issues.
</P>
<P>
Additional high-level meetings will be held at the ministerial
level in order expand dialogue and focus on trade concerns.
Government and embassy officials will also form joint working
groups in Beijing and Washington, and working business groups will
be formed to support the JCCT.
</P>
<P>
Wu announced that the JCCT has agreed to support the first
major finance seminar project in Beijing next spring, as well as
workshops on commercial law and export controls during the first
half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the workshops will help promote understanding between
China and US, and will greatly benefit the stable development of
Sino-US commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
History has proved that cooperation between China and US has
far outweighed conflicts, said Wu, adding that trade between
countries will continue to grow. She pointed to bright prospects
for greater understanding and cooperation between China, the
world's largest developing country, and the United States, the
world's largest developed nation.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that certain problems are inevitable in
large-scale Sino-US commercial relations, and noted the importance
of making full use of the existing dialogue system and solving
emerging problems through consultations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the two countries should focus on the 21st
century, constructively deal with conflicts on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit, and introduce practical steps to
promote development.
</P>
<P>
Daley noted that this has been the most successful JCCT
session. He said it proved the JCCT is important to bilateral
commercial ties, and has laid a solid foundation for the Sino-US
Summit later this month.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Daley met the correspondents following the session.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the JCCT was held in a friendly, cordial and
practical manner.
</P>
<P>
Daley expressed satisfaction with his trip to China, and noted
that the two countries not only face certain problems and
challenges in terms of commercial relations, but also vast
opportunities. He said bilateral relations will continue to
develop smoothly so long as the two countries maintain dialogue
and contacts.

<HEADLINE> Flower Display on Tian'anmen Square Extended to Mid-October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Four pots of blooming bauhinia
braving chilly breeze of Beijing's early autumn make gardening
expert Zhang Fubao feeling very proud.
</P>
<P>
The regional symbol flower of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region is placed with other 200,000 pots of flowers
on National Day's Tian'anmen Square to signify Hong Kong's return
to China on July 1. Its premier at the Chinese capital attracts
millions of people to come to watch.
</P>
<P>
But what mostly pleases Zhang is that he and his colleagues
successfully delay the florescence of this tropical plant to
September and October, in order to celebrate the opening of the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party on September
12 and the National Day on October 1.
</P>
<P>
"The most important and difficult thing (to build those large
floral mosaics) is to unify the blossom period of different
flowers," says Zhang, s senior engineerer of the Beijing Flowers
and Trees Company.
</P>
<P>
Workers at the company use many measures to fulfill the aim,
such as lowering the temperature, increasing or reducing
illumination in greenhouses, and using fertilizers, Zhang says.
</P>
<P>
Huge floral mosaics, fountains and lighting display on the
square around every National Day have come to be Beijing's most
attractive sightseeing spot since 1986, when the country
celebrated its 37th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Gardening workers usually deploy tens of thousands of potted
flowers from greenhouses to arrange them into various shapes in
the mid-September. The displaying period only lasts for some 20
days due to factors such as climate.
</P>
<P>
"But this year's work started from September 1 because of the
Party Congress," Zhang says, adding that the show time will last
until mid-October.
</P>
<P>
"We'll set a record in keeping the longest flower-display
period on Tian'anmen Square," Zhang says proudly.

<P>
FREETOWN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers using pickaxes and
earthmoving equipment are searching the collapsed building at the
Military Headquarters in Sierra Leone which were attacked by
Nigerian jet from ECOMOG on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The attack, according to state radio and TV, killed four
people including two soldiers, but independent reports put the
figure at up to 60 killed.
</P>
<P>
State radio also said 28 people including civilians were badly
injured, many of them hovering between life and death.
</P>
<P>
The military buildings, constructed seven years ago, were
extensively damaged.
</P>
<P>
A defense spokesman said, "the search will continue for some
time as up to 10 more soldiers have not been accounted for. They
may have been buried under the debris."
</P>
<P>
Residents in the area reported that the aircraft flew to the
area from the mountain tops adjacent to the military complex and
released seven rockets which hit the frontage of the building in
a dense black smoke.
</P>
<P>
A senior military officer said the attack may have been
prompted by a scheduled meeting at the headquarters which would
have been attended by the military leader, Major Johnny Paul
Koroma. The venue of the meeting was changed at the last minute.

<HEADLINE> Designer Explains WTO Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The new World Trade Organization
(WTO) logo is a hint of the globe, which is suggested by six
graphic arcs symbolizing member nations to forge strategic
alliances, Su Yeang, the logo's original designer said.
</P>
<P>
"Dynamism and optimism prevail as the swirls integrate,
encapsulating the WTO's united spirit of promoting fair and open
trade," Yeang said. Further strengthened by the "World Trade
Organization" embracing the globe, the organization's
responsibilities as the guardian and management consultant of
international trade are successfully reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Colors selected are bright and vibrant, in red, blue and green,
representing the major colors of the international flags of WTO
members, the designer said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the logo can be used in information kits,
conference bags, security passes, posters, banners, billboards,
stage design, media and delegate handbooks.
</P>
<P>
The logo, with six arcs in red, blue and green, is adapted from
the logo originally commissioned by the government of Singapore
for the WTO's first Ministerial Conference hosted by the country
last December. In April 1997, the WTO General Council accepted
Singapore's offer to transfer the logo and its copyright to the
WTO.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and France
today signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a forum for
political dialogue between the two countries, the South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed in Cape Town by South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and his French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine,
who is in South Africa for a short visit.
</P>
<P>
The forum will enable annual meetings between French and South
African foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, expert groups on bilateral relations,
multilateral cooperation and other international issues of common
interest are to be set up.
</P>
<P>
"This memorandum of understanding creates a formal mechanism
permitting the two governments to regularly exchange views on
international affairs," a statement of South Africa's Foreign
Affairs Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to cooperate in the training of
young diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The two men also signed an agreement under which France is to
give South Africa 13 million Rand (2.8 million U.S. Dollars) to
help with the transformation of South Africa's educational
system.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said the two agreements made concrete a will on the
part of the two countries to cooperate not only on a bilateral
level, but also in the areas of politics and economics.

visit to South Africa as foreign minister, is expected to hold
talks with South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and address
South African parliament's Foreign Relations Committee to unveil
Paris's newly revised policy toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
The new policy plan is expected to include a reduction of
French intervention in African conflicts, a determination to
pursue multilateral rather than solitary actions, a diminished
military presence on the continent and a much closer relationship
with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
France had traditionally maintained close relationships with
French-speaking African countries.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine is also scheduled to open a French business center in
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa and France enjoy well established diplomatic
relations and excellent cooperation in the fields of trade and
industry, culture, science and technology," the Foreign Ministry
statement said.

South Africa's imports from France last year was 4 billion
Rand (850 million Dollars) and exports to the country was 3
billion Rand (640 million Dollars), according to a French embassy

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Continues to Welcome Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will continue with
its privatization program, deregulation, liberalization and more
importantly to be responsive to the views of the business
community including genuine foreign investors, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Malaysia will continue to welcome foreign
investors and investors from Britain and Europe will find in this
country a business-friendly government, a market-driven economy, a
pro active private sector and a buoyant optimism.
</P>
<P>
"As a pragmatic government, we have instituted remedial
measures to reduce our expenditure, defer the big projects, reduce
costs and boost productivity so that we can continue our economic
progress," he said in a message in conjunction with the London
Dialogue on the theme "Malaysia and Britain - Dynamic Partnership
for the 21st Century" to be held in London on October 21.
</P>
<P>
He said "Despite recent turmoil in the financial markets,
Malaysia remains an attractive investment."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government has taken bold steps to overcome
the currency and stock market crisis.
</P>
<P>
"While we may slow down slightly next year, I am confident that
we shall still achieve moderately high growth with low inflation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, Malaysia achieved an 8.7 per
cent growth.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming dialogue, Mahathir said it is timely not
only to facilitate open and frank discussion on bilateral issues
but also to enable British businessmen, fund managers and
institutional investors to obtain first-hand information on the
current state of the Malaysian economy.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue is organized by Malaysia's Asian Strategy and
Leadership Institute (ASLI) with the cooperation of the
British-Malaysian Society, Asia House and the Malaysian
Commonwealth Studies Center, Cambridge University, and is expected
to be attended by some 300 top corporate leaders from both

<HEADLINE> Four Sets of Army Regulations Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, chairman of the
Central Military Commission, has issued an order to put into
effect four sets of revised regulations on interior service,
discipline, formation drilling and garrison concerning the
People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Original regulations were issued in the early 1990s, while the
new ones better carry out China's military strategy in the new
period and draw in the successful experience in the course of the
army building and reform over the past years, military sources
said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the new regulations will ensure the absolute
leadership of the Communist Party of China over the army, fully
implement the policies worked out at the just-ended 15th National
Party Congress, and raise the army's combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The new Regulation on Internal Service is to strengthen the
army's interior management, including new chapters on exchanges
with the outside, the usage of the national flag and playing and
singing of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation on Discipline places greater stress on reward
and punishment. The Regulation on Formation standardizes and
stipulates some basic formation actions.
</P>
<P>
The regulation on garrison makes it more explicit the task,
responsibility and system in terms of guard and garrison, together
with more articles on safeguarding the army's fame and the legal
rights of armymen.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Production Up Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial production
grew steadily in the first nine months of this year, with an
overall improvement in economic performance, and achieved an added
value of 1,480 billion yuan, up 11 percent over the same period of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state enterprises achieved 853.9 billion yuan in
added value, an increase of 7.4 percent against the figure of the
corresponding period of last year. State industrial firms
registered a 5.4 percent rise in the added value.
</P>
<P>
These are revealed by the latest monthly report issued by the
State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the market regulation is now playing an
increasingly big role, along with the progress in the
restructuring of the mix of industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The production of energy products and major raw materials had
been growing at a low speed, due to huge stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, China turned out a total of 930
million tons of standard coal, up 2.3 percent, and in the
meantime, major raw materials like sulphuric acid, thick nitric
acid, coke, cement and steel plate increased by 3.1-8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sales of daily necessities and household electric
appliances had experienced ups and downs for different
products. The output of washing machines, vacuum cleaners,
refrigerators, air-conditioners, electric cookers, color
television sets and audio sets surged by 8-36.2 percent, while
these of cigarettes, silk, bicycles, electric fans and cameras
dropped by 3.1-8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, the production-sales ratio for the
country's 370,000 industrial enterprises was 95.31 percent, 0.6
percentage points higher than that in the same period of last
year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the production-sales ratio went up to 96
percent and above, which was quite high compared with figures in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The report says that in the first eight months, the index for
the economic performance of the country's industrial enterprises was
87.5 percent, and these enterprises generated a total pre-tax
profit of 327.7 billion yuan, a 15 percent increase compared with
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the report points out, state-owned small enterprises
are still facing many problems, and the firms in the red are still
suffering from losses.

<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Forces Chief of
Staff Amnon Shahak is expected to pay a three-day visit to Turkey
to enhance military cooperation, the local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shahak will arrive here on Sunday and start talks with his
Turkish counterpart Ismail Hakki Karadayi and the top military
brass the next day, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, it
said, quoting senior officials from the Turkish General Staff who
declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to take up the date and other
specific arrangements concerning much-publicized joint naval
exercises of Israel, Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The three-way naval drill off the Israeli Mediterranean coast
had originally been set in May and was postponed to November
16. But reports had it that the U.S. wanted it to be further put
off until next January.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli embassy here was not available for comment on the
upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly growing military cooperation has been witnessed between
Turkey and Israel, which signed two agreements last year to allow,
among other things, the warplanes of each country to be trained in
the other's airspace.
</P>
<P>
This irked neighboring Arab countries, which condemned Turkey,
a predominantly Muslim country, of betraying the interests of the
Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss other defense issues including
Israel's assistance in modernizing Turkey's fighter planes and
joint training of their troops, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Has No Intention to Disrupt WTO Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today clarified that Malaysia's stand was
that it would not disrupt World Trade Organization (WTO)
negotiations on trade in financial services in Geneva on December
15 this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has no intention of disrupting the talks in any way,
but what it wants to do is to defend its interests as well as that
of emerging economies, Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said
here after a function.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's outspokenness
against curbing currency speculation had got the attention of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking the world to pay attention to Kuala Lumpur
alone but to safeguard the interests of Third World countries and
those which are rapidly developing including ASEAN," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said that WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero telephoned
him last night requesting for information relating to Malaysia's
recent proposal for regulations on currency trading, aimed at
curbing currency speculation which adversely affected ASEAN
economies.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that he also received a fax message from the World
Bank requesting for Malaysia's views to discuss the currency
problems affecting Malaysia and other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which met this week, has
also asked for Malaysia's views to study rules and regulations
relating to currency speculation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that WTO officials including Ruggiero are scheduled
to visit Malaysia at the end of this month to obtain feedback on
Malaysia's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the proposal and the calls by the prime
minister, which, though initially, shocked the world, seems to
have abated. They now accept our proposals and acknowledge our
resolve to further liberalize our markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar reiterated that the government did not intend to change
existing rules on currency trading in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current arrangements would be examined based
on information and a joint review would be made by IMF and World
Bank officials who would be talking with local officials in a few
days' time.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to continue efforts to liberalize, but we do
not want liberalization to bring about losses to developing
countries or that their interests could be undermined easily," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that regulations were needed to safeguard the interests
and economies of developing countries and that these countries
should not be exploited just for profits as that done by
speculators.

<HEADLINE> SAR Government Confident in Fulfilling Policy Targets: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa said
today that the government has determination and confidence in
materializing various objectives set out in his policy address.
</P>
<P>
Present in a phone-in program of the Radio Television Hong Kong
(RTHK) early this morning, Tung answered dozens of calls from
ordinary Hong Kong residents on the policy address he delivered
yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On questions related to housing, which is a primary concern of
local society, Tung said that the policy address has laid down
general housing targets, and the SAR government will spare no
effort to turn them into a reality.
</P>
<P>
The basic solution to the housing issue is increasing the
supply of land so that the property price would turn steady and
see a "soft landing", he added.
</P>
<P>
On the political structure of the HKSAR, the chief executive
pointed out that the Basic Law has shaped the democratic
development process of Hong Kong and provided legal guarantee for
democracy and freedom of the local people.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the government will, in accordance with
principles set in the Basic Law, work out detailed arrangements
for Hong Kong's democratic development.
</P>
<P>
Democratic development will proceed in an orderly way toward
the long-term objective of having the chief executive and the
legislature elected by universal suffrage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and enhancing economic competitiveness is another
focal point of Tung's maiden policy address.
</P>
<P>
The address proposed intensified efforts to develop high-tech
and high value-added industries so that Hong Kong's competitive
edge and economic vitality would be maintained, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The hotline program was broadcast live in Cantonese, Putonghua
and English.
</P>
<P>
Last night Tung attended a live televised panel discussion
organized by the RTHK, answering questions from representatives of
trade, media, youth, education and other sectors.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Centers
Association (WTCA), a non-government organization for the
promotion of global trade, will introduce a new electronic card to
"make trade more efficient", WTCA President Guy Tozzoli said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after the conclusion of the 28th
WTCA General Assembly, Tozzoli said that the TradeCard, "the
world's first credit card for international trade", will be issued
in the next 60 days after being tested for a year.
</P>
<P>
The card is a "revolutionary new trading tool" which operates
on personal computers, he said, noting that it will benefit
importers, exporters, bankers and transporters.
</P>
<P>
The WTCA and the General Electric have signed a strategic
partnership on the TradeCard, he added.
</P>
<P>
He described the four-day general assembly as a great success.
Hong Kong has always been a great place for the members of the
WTCA to trade and will continue to be so in the future, maybe even
better, he said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Hong Kong for the 55th time, Tozzoli commented that
there is almost no change in the city except for the difference in
the flag flying over.
</P>
<P>
The WTCA was founded in 1960 by Tozzoli to help small and
medium-sized companies engage in international trade. It grouped
only 16 member cities of seven countries at that time.
</P>
<P>
Now it boasts 318 member cities in 97 countries worldwide and
services over 500,000 businesses.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, with the theme "Windows on World Trade", included
training sessions, professional briefings and site visits. Wu Yi,
Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, made a
keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The 29th WTCA General Assembly will be held in Santiago, Chile,

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Accuses UN of Being Biased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone has said the United Nations Security Council's decision on
sanctions against the country is unfortunate and biased.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council announced the sanctions on Wednesday,
calling on the military junta "to take immediate steps to restore
democracy in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, however, will hurt the "poor Sierra Leonean
civilians," said Aliu Kamara, spokesman of Sierra Leone's current
supreme Armed Forced Revolutionary Council (AFRC), Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kamara's views were shared by an AFRC member, Sam Bakare, who
said the council was biased against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We are not worried about the sanctions. I can tell you that
the sanctions will not affect us as along as we have our
resources like diamond and gold, but it will affect the poor
innocent civilians of this country," Bakare said, quoted by press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kamara warned that the forces loyal to the junta
would attack the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), which
is enforcing an economic embargo on Sierra Leone ordered by the
sub-regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely going to attack ECOMOG positions if this is
what it makes the international community to understand that
Sierra Leone is being bombarded and harassed by Nigeria," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is leading the ECOMOG operations to enforce the
economic embargo to force the junta to return power to the
civilian government ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
According to Kamara, ECOMOG jets hit the powerhouse of the
military headquarters at about 2:00 Wednesday afternoon, and
repeated the attack two hours later, with the main building hit
and many people suffered.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to members of the international community
that Nigeria has gone beyond extreme and we are not going to
swallow this anymore. We are definitely going to defend our
territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Nigeria overstepped its peace enforcement
mandate with the bombardment, Kamara said: "As far as Nigeria is
concerned, the situation between Nigeria and Sierra Leone has
resulted into a state of war."
</P>
<P>
He also accused the international community of treating the
junta with disrepute, saying that the coup the military launched
in May "is not a haphazard coup", but one based on things.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated that the junta remained open to
negotiations with the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) while expecting the international community to come in
and negotiate the situation.
</P>
<P>
The UN decision on sanctions received welcome in Nigeria and
the toppled civilian government of Sierra Leone, which have been
seeking immediate ousting of the junta since the coup.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the five ECOWAS countries championing the
restoration of Sierra Leone's ousted government are to meet today
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, to discuss the situation with the
long-expected UN punitive measures on the junta.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Five, composed of Nigeria, Guinea,
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia, are coordinating the ECOWAS
objective of reinstating President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who was
removed in the coup.

<P>
NANJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A new scientific and technical
industrial park geared toward Taiwan investors was set up recently
in Nanjing, the capital of China's Jiangsu province, with approval
from the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the State
Science and Technology Commission.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Likely to Increase Gas Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
actively considering increase of gas price by over 15 percent from
next month, sources from the Energy Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase has become inevitable as the government is
committed to purchasing gas from private gas field developers from
April next year at a rate nearly double the current price, the
sources explained.
</P>
<P>
The average price of gas per unit (1,000 cubic feet = 304.8
cubic meters) is now 55 taka (about 1.24 U.S. dollars) and will
rise to about 63 taka (about 1.42 dollars) if the decision is
taken.
</P>
<P>
The government will purchase gas from private gas field
developers at a rate of about 90 taka (about 2.03 dollars) per
unit, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
If the government does not increase the price of gas now, it
will have to subsidize the gas to be purchased from Cairn in April
next and Occidental sometime later.
</P>
<P>
The government has plans to increase gas price by about 80
percent by the year 2001, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, if the government does not increase the gas
price immediately, it will be severely affected by a liquidity
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government will purchase 75 billion cubic feet (about 2.25
million cubic meters) during 1998-99 at a cost of 67.57 dollars.
About 260 billion cubic feet (about 7.80 million cubic meters) of
gas is now consumed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The gas price will be increased in four phases in the next four
years. The price of gas will be re-fixed at 64.77 taka (about 1.46
dollars) per unit next year, 86.09 taka (about 1.94 dollars) in
1999, 88.15 taka (about 1.99 dollars) in 2000 and 89.76 taka
(about 2.02 dollars) in 2001, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Gas price increase will have far-reaching impact on power
plants and fertilizer factories which account for nearly 80
percent of the natural gas consumed in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Fall After Greenspan's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
dived more than 1.6 percent today on the back of fears of a
United States economic contraction and improved job figures which
dampened hopes for a local interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index lost 46.2 points to 2722.2.
</P>
<P>
The fall came after Wall Street fell one percent on comments by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan which foreshadowed
increased wages, inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"There was some nervousness about what Alan Greenspan had to
say which saw Wall Street fall and spread to our market this
morning," Steve Mayne from Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported a strong
rebound of 74,700 new jobs last month, more than compensating for
the 38,200 jobs which disappeared in August.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were particularly hit by the news. National
Australia Bank shares fell 89.6 cents, ANZ lost 22 cents, Westpac
fell 14.2 cents and Commonwealth finished 20.5 cents lower.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index shed 81 points to 4475.5 while the
all resources fell 18.2 points to 1342.8.
</P>
<P>
Market bellwether BHP emerged better than most from today's
difficult day, losing just 15 cents to 15.92 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other resources heavyweights Rio Tinto and WMC did not fare as
well, with Rio falling 59.9 cents and WMC dropping 21 cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold sector performed well against the market today, with
the index losing only 0.7 points to 1334.2. Gold was traded at
2.25 U.S. dollars per ounce higher at 334.00 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover today was 337.4 million shares at a value of
997 million Australian dollars (722.8 million U.S. dollars), with
falls outnumbering rises 793 to 361.

<HEADLINE> Labor Exports From North Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin has had rapid development in its labor exports, earning
some 100 million US dollars from the service business since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The city, which has a population of nearly 10 million, has more
than 10,000 people working abroad, mainly in the countries of East
and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. It has sent 6,800 people
abroad for labor this year.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is rich in labor resources, experts say, with a fairly
high level of training and comparatively low costs. In order to
improve its labor service, it has provided greater training in
technology and languages for personnel who are likely to work
abroad.
</P>
<P>
More technicians are working in labor export programs,
officials say, the bulk in construction and tailoring.
</P>
<P>
"Priority will be given to large-scale technology-intensive
projects," one official with the municipal government says.

<HEADLINE> WTO Adopts Logo After Three Years' Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) today officially unveiled its logo, which has been absent
since the organization came into being in January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The logo, with six arcs in red, blue and green, is adapted from
the logo initially commissioned for the WTO's first Ministerial
Conference hosted by Singapore last December.
</P>
<P>
Its adoption "is another step in establishing this unique
institution on a firm and lasting foundation," said WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who unveiled the logo at a
ceremony held at the WTO headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
"It is the visual representation of a dynamic organization with
a vital role to play in ensuring the continued and rules-based
expansion of trade worldwide," Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
In April, the WTO General Council accepted Singapore's offer to
transfer to the WTO the logo and its copyright.
</P>
<P>
"A hint of the globe," said the logo's original designer Ms. Su
Yeang, "is suggested by the six graphic arcs symbolizing world
trade with member nations meeting to forge strategic alliances."
</P>
<P>
Su Yeang, who owns a Singapore-based graphic arts company named
after her, further explained that "dynamism and optimism prevail
as the swirls integrate, encapsulating the WTO's united spirit of
promoting fair and open trade."
</P>
<P>
In mid May 1998, the WTO will hold its second Ministerial
Conference in Geneva and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
multilateral trade system existing since the WTO's precedent, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was founded.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a total of 132 countries and regions are members of
the organization.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Sails Up on Jobs Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
almost one and half U.S. cents higher today, sailing on a wind of
optimism blown up by better-than-expected news on jobs growth.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 73.87 U.S. cents, sharply
stronger from 72.47 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The September data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
published today showed total employment leaped by 74,700 in the
month, almost doubling the average market forecast of a 43,200
advance, and the unemployment rate was 0.1 percent lower at 8.6
per cent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market greeted the news with a rush of
buying activity fueled by expectations among players that the
Reserve Bank of Australia will not ease monetary policy in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
"The market has taken the short term view that any rate cut is
not going to be in the next few days," said IBJ Australia senior
foreign exchange manager Shane Spurway.
</P>
<P>
Spurway said that the Australian dollar's upward move above
73.40 U.S. cents to an intra-day session high of 73.98 likely
signals the start of a small upward trend.
</P>
<P>
"So it should continue on and have a sniff around that 75 U.S.
cent level over the next week or so. But it all depends really on
the economic numbers coming out in the next two months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 89.48 Japanese yen, up from 88.66,
and at 1.2921 German marks, up from 1.2761.

<HEADLINE> Tung's Policy Address Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Policy Address delivered
by Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Tung Chee Hwa was hailed by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Most newspapers printed the full text of the Address, and
devoted pages to discussing and commenting on the first Policy
Address of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in its editorial that the
Address outlined the prospects of Hong Kong in the 21st century,
and designed programs for industrial development, information
technology, housing, education, social welfare and some other
issues.
</P>
<P>
An editorial in Wen Wei Po said that a major difference between
Tung's Address and those made by the former British Hong Kong
governors is that Tung's looks at things from a long-term point of
view with overall considerations, while the latter ones were often
short-sighted and favored instant benefits.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao commented that the Address represents the spirit of
"one country, two systems", and is full of the feeling of "loving
the motherland, loving Hong Kong". It is progressive and full of
confidence, bringing people a message that Hong Kong is welcoming
its new era.
</P>
<P>
Commentaries in many newspapers also pointed out that the
British colonial rule has left the SAR government with many
difficult problems, such as housing, quality of education, boat
people and social welfare. Tung's Address designed programs and
set target for resolving these problems, which are both practical
and feasible.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers also published reaction from local organizations,
social communities and individuals, many of them expressed
welcome to Tung's Address and some of them also gave their
suggestions regarding the working programs outlined in the
Address.

<HEADLINE> World Bank President to Visit Pakistan Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn will make a five-day visit to Pakistan starting from
October 18, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The tour by Wolfensohn, who will also visit Bangladesh, will
highlight the achievements and challenges of development in South
Asia, sources from the World Bank Office here said.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms taking root across the region are stimulating
strong growth and investment and social indicators are slowly
improving.
</P>
<P>
But South Asia remains one of the poorest regions having the
largest concentration of poor in the world, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Following Africa, South Asia is the largest regional recipient
of concessional lending from the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's affiliate that provides
interest-free loans to the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Bangladesh are among the top recipients of IDA
funds. Pakistan is also a substantial borrower from the
International Bank for Reconstruction Development, the World
Bank's main lending arm which provides loans at near-commercial
terms, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Wolfensohn will meet with representatives of
business, non-governmental organizations, politicians as well as
the media.
</P>
<P>
He will look at both World Bank-supported and other development
projects and interact with direct beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The visit will highlight important themes of the Bank's work
such as forging partnerships with civil society, fostering
community participation in development projects, broadening access
and improving the quality of social services to the poor, battling
corruption, and promoting sound macroeconomic management and
banking systems.

</P>
<P>
He said the present government was keen to promote female
education for the socio-economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Education was an important source of development and prosperity
for a nation, Ahmed said, adding that was why the present
government was giving top priority to this important sector.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the educational institutions to introduce
computer education in their respective institutions because "this
is a computer age".
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has established six more educational
institutions for women to solve the growing admission problem to
the female students.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Make "Correct Choice" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A well-known businessman in Macao
today urged the Taiwan authorities to make a correct historical
choice in the interests of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, said at
a gathering marking the 86th anniversary of the "Revolution of
1911," which overthrew the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), that the
Taiwan authorities should abandon its splitting activities, and
achieve reunification with the mainland on the basis of the "one
country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities would make a correct
historical choice, joining hands (with the Communist Party of
China) in achieving reunification and prosperity of the Chinese
nation by seeking common grounds under the principle of 'one
China' and the policy of 'one country, two systems,'" he said at
the ceremony attended by more than 100 celebrities and
representatives in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Also executive chairman of the presidium of the Committee for
the Celebration of the 48th Anniversary of the Founding of the
People's Republic of China, Ma blasted the Taiwan authorities for
"trumpeting 'Taiwan independence,'" which he said has blocked the
process of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"The splitting cliques in the Taiwan island and the
interference by some anti-China foreign powers have severely
hindered the process of peaceful reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan authorities have been wantonly trumpeting 'Taiwan
independence', creating 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan.'
They have betrayed the interests of the Chinese nation, and are
naturally met with resolute opposition from the Chinese people as
a whole, including the Taiwan compatriots," he added.

<HEADLINE> Father Found for One-Year-Old Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A male panda named Liang Liang
has finally been identified as the father of a one-year-old female
giant panda just as the cub began to meet visitors in the Beijing
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
It has puzzled zoo keepers as to who, among three potential
ones, was the real father of Jing Xin ever since the baby panda
was born on October 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
The white streaks on both hind legs of Jing Xin, identical to
those on Liang Liang's body, enabled zoo keepers to conclude that
Liang Liang is the father because the pattern of the streaks on the
hind legs of a panda is the most crucial body feature decided by
genes, explained Zhang Jinguo, deputy director of the Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
He added that other similarities between the two also
contributed to the identification.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said: "it is very important to know who the real father
is so that inbreeding among pandas will be prevented in the
future, and more healthy panda cubs will be born."
</P>
<P>
The cub's mother Le Le, during her estrus cycle last spring,
mated three times with a male partner Ying Ying, two times with
Liang Liang, and was artificially inseminated with the germ of
another male called Lin Nan.
</P>
<P>
Le Le gave birth to two cubs on October 4 last year, but only
Jing Xin survived, who is also the sole surviving panda cub born in
Chinese zoos last year. Born with a weight of just 120 grams, the
baby panda now weighs 40 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the most endangered species on
earth. There are only some 1,000 surviving pandas today, most of
them living in western China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi
provinces.
</P>
<P>
A mature female panda can get pregnant once a year if she
successfully mates with a male during the three-to-five-day estrus
period, and can produce one or two cubs.

<HEADLINE> Inflation to Go Up in India Later This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation is likely to surge in the second half of 1997-98
financial year (April 1,1997 - March 31, 1998), a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation will go up in the second half of the current year as
we assume that the increase in cost will be passed on," he said.
</P>
<P>
October-March is likely to witness a seven percent average
inflation as there has been an increase in money supply at 16
percent in the first half of 1997-98, which has been more than the
targeted level of 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The indirect impact of petroleum price hike has still not flown
into the system, the official said. This year is likely to end
with an average inflation of about six percent.
</P>
<P>
The projected annual average inflation of six percent is one of
the lowest since the economy was opened up in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Prudence in Japan-US Security Cooperation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China today urged Japan and the
United States to "act with prudence" in their cooperation under
the new Japan-US defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the call at a
weekly news conference when he was asked by Xinhua to respond to
the recent China visit by Japan's Deputy Vice-Foreign Minister
Minolu Tanbu.
</P>
<P>
Shen said Tanbu visited China October 8 for the purpose of
briefing and explaining to the Chinese side the new Japan-US
defense cooperation guidelines on behalf of the Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan listened to his
briefing, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen, the Japanese side made it clear during the
briefing that Japan would, in its defense cooperation with the US
under the new guidelines, adhere to the policy of defense limited
to its own territory and coastal waters and three non-nuclear
principles in conformity with its peace constitution, and act in
strict observance of the UN charter and norms of international
laws.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side made an explanation on the concept of
"surrounding situation" in the new guidelines, saying that it is
not a geographical concept but rather a concept pertaining to the
nature of the events that would have major impact on Japan's peace
and security. Japan will never use force outside its own
territory, unless it it is attacked by military forces. Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side went on to assure the Chinese side that it
would not support "two Chinas" or Taiwan independence and that it
would continue to observe all the principles set forth in the
Japan-China Joint Statement and Japan-China Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side made a comprehensive elaboration of its views
and position on the new guidelines. It pointed out that the
Japan-US security cooperation mechanism was a bilateral
arrangement that was evolved under the specific historical
conditions of the Cold War era, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Today, Shen went on, as the international situation is in
general moving towards relaxation, this arrangement should all the
more be kept within the bilateral framework.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese side considers the elaboration and explanation made
by the Japanese side on the term surrounding situation as "obscure
and unconvincing," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side has repeatedly stated that the Japan-US
security cooperation has not been expanded in scope and neither is
it directed against any third country. However, it has also said
that it is unable to geographically define the surrounding
situation, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
In other words, Shen added, the geographical sphere of the
surrounding situation can in reality be determined and expanded at
will. The Chinese side expressed its concern over the provision in
the new guidelines for Japan's military role outside its
territory, and hoped that Japan would draw lessons from history,
honor its commitment to development through peace instead of
striving to become a military power.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side stressed that a major reason for China's
concern with the guidelines was that it involved Taiwan issue,
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
China's position on the question of Taiwan is firm and
consistent, he noted. The Chinese government and people find it
absolutely unacceptable for the Japan-US defense cooperation to
cover the Taiwan region directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
Since the Japanese government has made commitment on the
question of Taiwan in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, we hope that the
Japanese side will honor its words, highly respect the Chinese
position on the question of Taiwan, and strictly abide by the
relevant principles and spirit enshrined in the above-mentioned
two documents, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side hopes that both Japan and the US, when
conducting cooperation under the new guidelines, will "take care
of the concerns and worries of the neighboring countries in Asia,
including China, take into serious consideration the general trend
of peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region, and act with
prudence, so as not to cause concern and uneasiness to the
surrounding countries or further complicate the security situation
of this region," the spokesman noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Cuban leader Fidel Castro today
vowed to push ahead policies for the country's economic recovery
despite tightened U.S. economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economic embargo further stepped up in recent years
made it more difficult for Cuba to survive the changes following
the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
But the Cuban people, he told the opening session of a
Communist Party national congress, didn't bow to the U.S. pressure
and instead meet the challenge with a series of solutions.
</P>
<P>
Castro, the first secretary of the Communist Party, made the
remarks in front of the 1,500 delegates to the 5th party congress.
</P>
<P>
In a seven-hour speech, he reviewed what happened inside and
outside Cuba in the past six years after the 4th party national
congress in 1991, and what the party did to keep the economy going.
</P>
<P>
The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the East European
socialist bloc, Castro said, ended the energy and raw materials
supplies, as well as most of the market accesses, for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
With the manufacturing sector being paralyzed, the economy
plunged into a severe crisis, he noted, adding that its gross
domestic product (GDP) was down 34 percent between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Then, a series of new policies of the government, led by the
party, came to the rescue, reversing the downward trend in 1994
and boosting the GDP growth to a projected 2-3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The measures included expanding the tourism sector, encouraging
foreign capital inflow, allowing Cuban citizens to keep hard
currencies, and easing restrictions on self-employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also as this Caribbean island's president, Castro condemned the
continued U.S. hostility, alleging that all of the 20 recent cases
of sabotage in Cuba were "organized and supplied" from the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Fu Mingxia Makes No Splash in National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- When Barcelona Olympic champion
Sun Shuwei paced ace divers Yu Zhuocheng and Lan Wei to win the
men's team gold medal for Guangdong province, people harbored the
idea that diving in the National Games is to become the showcase
for the veterans.
</P>
<P>
The trend may well prove to be true, with the exception for Fu
Mingxia, the world's most successful diver in the 1990s, who has
stepped away from the pool after making a golden double in the
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 10-meter platform on Monday, a fortress Fu has
held for years, Wang Rui, a native of Beijing, stole the limelight
by taking home the gold medal, declaring the end of Fu's dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Fu was expected to replace American legend Greg
Louganis as the all-time greatest diver, but the triple Olympic
champion halted her illustrious career by herself, becoming an
bystander from a heroine.
</P>
<P>
She jumped to fame in Barcelona at age 13, throwing herself
from the 10-meter platform, flipping and twisting her body for
straight-down perfect dives in the 1992 Olympic Games wherein she
became the youngest to win an Olympic platform gold medal.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Fu Mingxia became one of the great athletes of the
time by clinching double golds on both platform and springboard.
The Chinese woman is only one gold shy of the record of four
shared by Pat McCormack and Greg Louganis, both of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The child of Barcelona who will turn out to 22 in Sydney, has
surprisingly become a controversial figure by stirring up "the
retirement dispute" only 13 months after her Atlanta glory.
</P>
<P>
Last year, she submitted her retirement application to the
national diving team, making a big impact upon the diving circle
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired, I don't want to dive on," said the teenager diving
star who was tipped to repeat her feat in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Fu complained that she had long been plagued with
injuries to her legs, shoulders and waist, and she was afraid of
paralysis, a dire possibility in more tough trainings and
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Although the national squad badly needs a veteran as the
coreforce in the international arena before the debutants become
mature in their skills and experience, Fu, now majors in economics
in Qinghua University, insisted that she couldn't return to the
pool for another span of time.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion whose smile won over the world in Atlanta,
said that "only I myself alone know how much I had suffered in the
four years after the Barcelona Games. I'm too exausted, I have no
choice but to quit."

BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Icelandic government has

<HEADLINE> Coach Ma Junren not Included in National Games Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ma Junren, who coached "Ma
Family Army" to sweep nearly all women's middle and long distance
golds in major international meets in 1993, was not included in
the roster of Liaoning delegation for the upcoming Eighth National
Games.
</P>
<P>
Ma was a surpring absentee from the name list of the delegation
which consists all of the athletes, officials and coaches, sources
from the organizing committee revealed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the legendary coach's 30 proteges will take part in the
National Games which will raise its curtain here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the "mysterious" coach could make an
unexpected appearance in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Ma was also not included in the track team
list in the qualifying round, but he was there eventually.
</P>
<P>
The big names among his disciples are Liu Dong and Qu Yunxia,
both won gold medals in the 1993 World Athletics Championships in
Stuggart.
</P>
<P>
His most glittering star deciple Wang Junxia, who won the
women's 5,000-meter gold in Atlanta and still holds the world
10,000-meter record, will not participate in the National Games
due to an injury.
</P>
<P>
Wang, along with Liu, broke away from coach Ma in 1994 because
Ma reportedly refused to give them the Mercedes Benz cars which
they won as a gift at Stuttgart. The two talented women athletes
are nowsdays coached by Mao Dezhen.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1994 Asian Games, Ma has been coaching a new army
inluding many teenage runners, and over 30 of them qualified for
the National Games.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the Games, he led the army to the high-altitude
Duoba training center in Qinghai province, the ninth time he had
been there prior to the major competitions.
</P>
<P>
In fact, people all around the country expect him to creat
another miracle after the Chinese athletes failed to win a single
medal in the sixth World Athletics Championships in Athlens in
August.

<HEADLINE> 19th South East Asian Games to Open on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The 19th South East Asian Games
are scheduled to open here on Saturday with more than 4,300
athletes from 10 nations to attend.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about smog, mosquitoes and facilities held centre
stage on Thursday as athletes already arrived here
</P>
<P>
Hosts Indonesia, with the largest contingent, are favourites to
grab the most medals at the biennial games, which feature 34
events ranging from sports like soccer, swimming and athletics to
more exotic regional specialities such as sepak takraw, wushu and
traditional boat racing.
</P>
<P>
In the days leading up to the opening ceremony, athletes and
officials were making typical pre-games complaints about
unfinished or sub-par venues and housing facilities.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's badminton and shooting teams complained about an
infestation of mosquitoes at the main sports centre.
</P>
<P>
SEA Games officials apologised for hoisting an incorrect
Malaysian flag at the Hotel Mulia where many of the foreign
athletes are staying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, who had a record-breaking haul of gold medals at
the 1995 Chiang Mai games, complained that their athletes had
been split up and housed in more than a dozen different hotels.
</P>
<P>
The smog, caused by raging forest fires in parts of
Indonesia, has not yet been a major problem in the Indonesian
capital but most team officials were taking precautions.
</P>
<P>
Many athletes have expressed concern about the smog and
whether it would affect their performances.
</P>
<P>
Officials from many teams said they were bringing face
masks and eye and nose drops to combat effects of the smog.
</P>
<P>
Some teams, such as Singapore's soccer squad, have already
encountered the smog in their training sessions in their home
countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian fans and supporters from neighbouring countries
are expected to be out in full force for the weeklong SEA
Games. A school holiday declared in Jakarta from October 13
through 18 will probably add to the crowds.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A computer tax collection network
has been established in seven prefectures and cities in the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
A computer center run by the tax collection department in
Lhasa, the regional capital, is connected to tax offices at the
grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenues have been a problem for the local government,
because of the region's vast territory and the fact that there are
many prefectures on the high plateau.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet tax bureau started the trial use of computers in
three offices last November, and one official says that his bureau
has collected more taxes thanks to the computer system.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
granted South Africa 200 million Rand (about 43 million U.S.
dollars) in aid to meet the latter's development, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to the effect was signed by South African Deputy
Finance Minister Gill Marcus and U.S. Ambassador James Joseph.
</P>
<P>
The American aid was mainly targeted at the South African
priorities such as low income housing, disadvantaged
universities, health care and the justice system, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the U.S. had given more than 4.6 billion Rand
(almost one billion U.S. dollars) in aid to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the early years most of this money went to non-governmental
organizations (NGO), but today it was almost evenly split between
NGO's and government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last December the value of U.S fixed investment
in South Africa was eight billion U.S. Dollars. American firms
operating in South Africa had sales of about 10 billion dollars
and the value of bilateral trade last year was more than five
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Suit Dutch Shipping Company for Unlawful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that its
judicial branch will take legal action against a Dutch liner owned
by Smit Tug Company for its unlawful activities in Iranian
waters.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted a statement of Mahmoud
Mohammadi, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, as saying that the
judicial branch is investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
On august 19, the two Dutch vessels, contracted by Iran to
salvage a sunken Croatian ship in the Persian Gulf, abandoned the
mission and headed for another part of the Persian Gulf to pull
out the debris of a U.S. helicopter crashed in Iran's territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced in September that two Dutch vessels were
confiscated by the Iranian security guards at Imam Khomeini port
for operating in Iran's territorial waters without permission.
</P>
<P>
In the statement today, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said
that all the shipping crews with the exception of the captains in
addition to some flotillas had been released against the guarantee
provided by the company.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the Dutch ships were seized at the time
when they were engaged in a different kind of activity other than
the assigned mission in the Iranian territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
"Such a measure was against the national security of the
Islamic Republic of Iran," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Dutch special delegation comprising a
Foreign Ministry official and the director of Smit International
Sea Contract arrived here on September 20, 1997 to negotiate with
the Iranian side.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stated that the Dutch delegation was informed by
the Iranian officials during several sessions of the negotiation
that the act of abandoning their contracted assignment was unlawful
according to the international law and the terms of contract.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi noted that any plying of a foreign vessel within
Iran's territorial waters needed official permission from the
related Iranian agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Dutch delegation rendered its
apology for that operation and promised to compensate for all of
damages incurred Iran.

<HEADLINE> Elderly In China Eager To Learn More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xianfa, an 80-year-old
who was formerly in charge of the Henan provincial health
department in central China, decided to enroll in a local college
for senior citizens when he retired, and he's not the only one to
go to college after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Many of the elderly in Henan who want to add a little color to
their lives are taking courses in health care, psychology,
literature, history, calligraphy, photography, and painting in
local schools for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
The first university for retired cadres was set up in Henan in
1985, but there are now 862 of these schools, with more than
600,000 students.
</P>
<P>
"The more exercise the brain gets, the sharper it becomes,"
Wang, who used to be a doctor, explains. His daily life also
includes reciting poems, both in school and after class.
</P>
<P>
Another senior citizen, Lu Zhaoya, has had his paintings and
calligraphies at more than 70 exhibitions both at home and abroad,
and has won at least 30 prizes. Recently, a book of photos of his
paintings was published.
</P>
<P>
In the first national calligraphy and painting contest for the
elderly held earlier this year, a dozen contestants from Henen
were given awards.
</P>
<P>
And, while schools for the elderly in urban areas tend to focus
on courses that help one's cultural attainments, those in rural
areas usually hold courses on farming techniques like planting
crops and breeding livestock.

PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In their book "L'Affaire Yann Piat," journalists Andre
Rougeot and Jean-Michel Verne developed the hypothesis of a plot
by secret agents of the state who killed parliament deputy Piat,
because of his knowledge about real estate projects linking the
mafia with two government ministers at that time.
</P>
<P>
Francois Leotard, who was defense minister at that time, and
the mayor of Marseille Jean-Claude Gaudin, who were suggested in
the book as the men behind the murder, had warned the authors of
the book that they would counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Former Defense Minister and president of the Union for
French Democracy, Francois Leotard, and the mayor of Marseille
Jean-Claude Gaudin have launched a legal proceeding against the
book "L'Affaire Yann Piat: Assassins au Coeur du Pouvoir," calling
for the suppression of certain pages of the book and urging its
authors to "immediately prove what they have presented."
</P>
<P>
But the authors of the book, journalists Jean-Michel Verne and
Andre Rougeot, said they had not hinted who were behind the murder
of Yann Piat, a parliament deputy assassinated in 1994.

<P>
SHENYANG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A health education program is
paying off in northeast China's Liaoning Province, with the
average life expectancy increasing in just seven years by more
than half a year to 71.71.
</P>
<P>
According to local health officials, the infant mortality rate
has dropped by eight per thousand compared since 1990 and the
incidence of epidemics is down 20 percent and the mortality rate
down by two thirds.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has stepped up health education since 1990 and has

villages and 10 million families, with different fitness programs
and training courses targeting different groups of people.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of primary and middle schools in the province
have health education courses that have helped greatly in reducing
the incidence of diseases that affect the young.
</P>
<P>
A recent study of 3,000 students in 30 primary schools found
that the ratio near-sighted students has dropped to 18 percent

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Homa Bay Blocked by Water Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Homa Bay has been
blocked following the spread of water hyacinth to the area, the
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
For the past three weeks, there has been no lake transport to
Homa Bay, even the large big steamer failed to pass through the
weed mass to dock at the Homa Bay pier, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Railways authorities has sent out circulars to its
customers warning them not to deliver cargo destined for the area
and its environs for fear of the goods getting stuck in the water
hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The authorities noted that "we have already sent a notice to
all our customers not to send cargo to Kisumu because the water
hyacinth has blocked a large part of Homa Bay, K'owuor and Kendu
Bay, which are the major docking stations in the local lake
transport."
</P>
<P>
However, the authorities said that the main routes including
Kisumu-Mwanza in Tanzania and Kisumu-Port Bell in Uganda are not
affected by the weed problem.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that water hyacinth had not affected the ports
in Uganda and Tanzania to an extent that the ships cannot dock as
the steamers plying the main routes are powerful enough to easily
penetrate the weed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Pakistan to Punish Murderers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei has put more pressure on the Pakistani government for it
to ferret and punish killers of five Iranians in the country last
month.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iran News today, Khamenei, while receiving
relatives of the murdered Iranians, said "This incident must be
seriously followed up by the Pakistani government and those who
have committed this crime must be brought to justice."
</P>
<P>
If Islamabad fails to fulfill its responsibility, the supreme
leader was quoted as saying, it would mean this government is
trying to assist the terrorists and would consequently cause
strain in the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Five Iranian air force technicians of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps were killed on September 17 in Rawalpindi, near the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad. No one has claimed responsibility
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Shiite Muslim-dominant Iran and Sunni
Muslim-dominant Pakistan have more often than not been off-key
despite efforts to closing the ranks between them.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei expressed sorrow that the "dearest and best Iranian
youths could not enjoy a secure life" in a "friendly and
neighborly country like Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"The criminal designs were fomented by those who are against
seeing the growth of a friendly relationship between the two
nations," he asseted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Want Parliament to Remain in Cape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The majority of South
Africans were in favor of retaining their parliament in Cape Town
rather than moving it to another place, South African Press
Association quoted research survey figures as showing.
</P>
<P>
At present, South Africa has three capital cities: Pretoria
(executive), Cape Town (legislative) and Bloemfontein (judicial).
</P>
<P>
There were proposals that parliament be moved to Pretoria to
save time and money as government officials and parliament
members involved now have to shuttle between these cities.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted in September to study public opinion on the
matter showed that 55 percent of the respondents said they wanted
parliament to stay in Cape Town, 17 percent felt that it should
be moved to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Six percent mentioned Midrand, a small city between Pretoria
and Johannesburg, and 4 percent were in favor of Bloemfontein.
Sixteen percent said they did not think much about the issue and
failed to mention any place.
</P>
<P>
When looking at the results in more detail, it revealed that
65 percent of whites compared to 50 percent of blacks chose Cape
Town as a suitable place for parliament.
</P>
<P>
Of the black respondents, 20 percent chose Pretoria compared
to 10 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
Capetonians were more assertive on the matter. Some 74 percent
of whites and 89 percent of blacks surveyed did not want
parliament to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said 2,000 people were interviewed in major
metropolitan areas across the country, highly representative of
the urban population in terms of age and income.
</P>
<P>
According to independent assessment, moving parliament from
Cape Town to Pretoria could cost 3.5 billion Rand (745 million
U.S. Dollars).

COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's government troops
this morning recaptured the Mankaulam-Mullaitivu road in Northern
province after several days of heavy fighting with the Tamil
rebels, a military spokesman said here today.
</P>

Spokesman Sarath Munasinghe told a press conference this

The road, which had been controlled by the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) since June last year, is of vital importance
for the government to transport goods from the center of Northern
province to the eastern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
The 50-kilometer road lies at the north of Puliyankulam town,
where the government troops have been fighting with the rebels for
nearly two months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bank Head Honored Africa's Best Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
Governor Micah Cheserem has been honored the "African Central
Banker of the Year" by the "Euromoney Magazine".
</P>
<P>
The September issue of the magazine said that Cheserem's work
over the last five years had helped to stabilize the Kenyan
economy in the face of great difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He has made significant contributions to Kenyan economy and
has managed to tame inflation rate to well below the 9 percent
mark from 101 percent recorded in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The governor is one among a "handful of people to have come
out of the IMF (International Monetary Fund)-Kenya tussle with
any credit", it noted.
</P>
<P>
The magazine described Cheserem as a reformer who has voiced
disapproval at the hardliners' refusal to co-operate with the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent political upheaval and a lurching Shilling,
the governor has done an admirable job, said the magazine, adding
that he had been eager to discuss a shadow program with the IMF
which would provide advice but no credits.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem's award was motivated by his recent moves to team up
with the Minister for Finance, Musalia Mudavadi, to renew talks
with the IMF, it added.
</P>
<P>
The magazine has declared South Africa's Trevor Manuel as the
Best African Finance Minister of the year as he is said to have
put macro-reform into the right gear.
</P>
<P>
"Euromoney Magazine" has annual awards for top finance
minister and central banker worldwide.

<P>
HANGZHOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ying Zhulan, of Yongding
village of Wenling city in east China's Zhejiang province, has
made a name for herself as a farmer technician.
</P>
<P>
Ying, who is in her 30s, did this by acquiring fruit growing
skills two years ago and has become a village role model by
striking it rich using new farming technology. All this with two
ha. of citrus trees and 1.7 ha. of watermelons.
</P>
<P>
Women villagers are now eager to know more about new farming
techniques, and more than 60,000 of them in the province have
received special training, and 14,000 have become peasant
technicians in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The local government began the training program in 1994 to help
them get away from poverty, and rural women have become the
backbone of farm work as more men began to go outside the province
to make money after China's opening-up began, an official of the
Zhejiang Women's Federation explains.
</P>
<P>
Women account for more than 60 percent of the province's farm
laborers, so any increase in their knowledge of science and
technology helps local agricultural development, the official
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Posts and

</P>
<P>
Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications Chen

<P>
"The country's total digital exchange capacity is now 48
percent of the whole network and it is expected to reach 80
percent by the year 2000. Transmission capacity is also expected
to reach 70 percent in two years time," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
If the same rate was maintained, he said, the PTC would be
able to wipe out the waiting list of over 100,000 by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe, with a population of 12 million, now had
212,000 telephone lines compared to 98,376 main lines at
independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said in achieving this, the PTC had to tackle the problems
of satisfying a growing demand for telephones, replacing an old
telephone system which had outlived its life span and expanding
the network to cover areas which were previously ignored.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Guangzhou Paper
Manufacturing Group Ltd opened here Wednesday, but there was no
ceremony to mark the occasion - because it donated the money set
aside for that to a poverty-relief program.
</P>
<P>
The group donated 200,000 yuan (about 25,000 US dollars) for
building a primary school in the Baise region in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region of southwest China, one of the country's
18 poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangzhou was given the task of helping the region
fight poverty, and the city has donated 30 million yuan to help
10,000 villagers. Various means have been employed to help develop
the region. The city's women's federation has collected about
150,000 yuan for Baise's poverty-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring Festival (the lunar new year), city
government leaders went to the region to extend greetings to local
people and to bring 300,000 yuan in relief funds. The city's
Garden Hotel helped two villages in the region solve their water
and electricity supply problems.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the scale has grown. City departments and
enterprises have signed 27 co-operation agreements with the Baise
Region to help it develop breeding, planting, agricultural product
processing, and building materials businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli company announced
it has invented a new process for environmentally friendly and
inexpensive production of electricity and desalinated water by
using sea wave.
</P>
<P>
According to local report today, the new process, which is
under the United States patent, was developed by the SDF company,
a small, start-up company based in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Having completed a successful working model for the production
of 1,500 watts, SDE has received financial backing from the Office
of Israel's Chief Scientist under the Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to build a four megawatt installation on a
tract of coastal land in the Mediterranean coastal city Ashdod,
about 50 kilometers southwest of Tel Aviv, within six to eight
months.
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimated that sea-wave power can potentially supply
up to 15 percent of the world's electrical needs, as well as
desalinated water for countries with sea coasts but facing fresh
water shortages.

<HEADLINE> Female Chef Sets Noodle Pulling Record in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese chef has made 3,000
meters of noodles drawing the dough out by hand, according to a
report in the Beijing Evening News.
</P>
<P>
Hu Shuxia's masterpiece beat out five other contestants at a
"Noodle Pulling" contest organized by China's largest TV network,
China Central Television.
</P>
<P>
The contestants, who were from different parts of the country
had to draw a kilogram of dough into noodles as thin as nylon
thread.
</P>
<P>
Hu is a chef at the Wuyi Hotel in Xi'an city. Her noodles were
all connected and were measured at a total length of 2,940.48
meters. The "noodle thread" was long enough to go around Beijing's
Tian'anmen Square, the world's largest square.
</P>
<P>
Hand-pulled noodles have been a favorite on Chinese dining
tables for centuries, even though the large variety of
machine-made noodles available today provide urbanities with
greater convenience.
</P>
<P>
Noodles are an important part of various celebrations like
birthday parties, in addition to blowing out candles and sharing
cakes, because many people still believe that long noodles signify
longevity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coach Calls For More Matches for Young Divers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese divers should take
part in more formal competitions in order to steel their nerves, a
famous diving coach recommended here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu Enyong, coach of the Olympic silver medalist Yu Zhuocheng,
said that it's a right time for the Chinese divers to bid farewell
to the current close-door training system.
</P>
<P>
"Under the existing system, many divers usually have top-notch
performances in the training but lose their forms in the official
competitions. This is an abnormal phenomenon," Hu said after the
men's one-meter diving finals of the eighth Chinese National Games
to be officially opened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jingjing of Hebei province happened to justify Hu's
worrysome argument.
</P>
<P>
Guo, tipped as "the precious successor to the triple Olympic
champion Fu Mingxia", failed to qualify for the women's 10-meter
platform finals.
</P>
<P>
The bad omen also beckoned on anothr promising budding star Cai
Yuyan, Hu said. Cai led the semifinals in the women's platform but
slipped to the sixth at last.
</P>
<P>
"Cai surprised everyone including herself to lead the semis,
but she told me she was too nervous on the platform to remember
anything in the finals," Hu lamented.
</P>
<P>
"Cai had the calibre to win the title after half-a-year's hard
training, the only thing she lacks is the experience of major
competitions both at home and abroad."
</P>
<P>
Other experts, including Beijing coach Wu Guolin and
international judge Xuan Zengyong also echoed the same argument,
saying that the lack of experience has blunted some Chinese
divers, especially those youngsters, to achieve satisfactory
results in the international diving arenas.
</P>
<P>
"Divers in some Western countries begin their competitions at a
very young age, usually twice a week. But our young stars cannot
see a major event in one whole year. Thus, it's not a surprise
for them to make fatal mistakes in their eventual formal
competitions," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Peso Plunge Temporary: Philippine Business Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in the
Philippines believed that the peso's depreciation was temporary
and the country would weather the financial storm, the Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders expressed their optimism when attending
the 23rd Philippine Business Conference which opened in Cebu City
Wednesday. President Fidel Ramos would address the meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said at the meeting
that the country is not experiencing "a foreign exchange crisis",
but only a "wide-spreading storm", citing as proof the country's
reserves, high export growth rate and low-level inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulties that arose were not the result of any
intrinsic weakness in our own economy. They were the consequence
of a general realignment of regional currencies brought about by
the financial meltdown in Thailand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bautista encouraged the business leaders to help lessen the
adverse effects of the peso's devaluation by increasing
productivity, bringing down production cost and accepting thinner
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
Federico Pascual, president of the Philippine Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, shared the view with Bautista, saying while
the banking and real property sectors remained sound, the
country's export growth rate of 22 percent is the highest in
Southeast Asia.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka said today that the
U.S. decision to ban the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
from entering or raising fund in the United States was a victory
of Sri Lanka's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravinatha Aryasinha said this
morning at a news conference that the U.S. decision was a
testimony of a strong and healthy bilateral relationship between
Sri Lanka and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madelene Albright Wednesday announced
that the LTTE, along with 29 other organizations in the world, was
on the terrorist organization list and would be barred from
entering and raising fund in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
She said members of the listed groups would be ineligible for
visas to enter the U.S. and that their funds would be frozen under
a new anti-terrorism law signed by American President Bill Clinton
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Aryasinha said Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar, who concluded a visit to the U.S. Wednesday night, was
informed by the U.S. State Department of the decision hours before
leaving Washington.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister had stressed Sri Lanka's request to the
U.S. to declare the LTTE as a terrorist organization while meeting
with Albright, Aryasinha said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "This decision by the government of the
United States can be expected to have a considerable effect on how
other governments and international organizations view the LTTE."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for an independent state in the
north and east of this island nation since 1983. So far 55,000
people had died of the war.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Exporters Worry over Peso Depreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- While government planners
remained optimistic that the fall of the peso will advance
exports, exporters themselves are not too happy about the 35
percent plunge of the peso.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted export leader Benson
Dakay as saying that exporters whose products are manufactured
mostly from imported raw materials are the most adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
These products include semiconductor devices, communication
equipment, electronic products, garments and even furniture, all
top dollar earners in the country, Dakay said.
</P>
<P>
Exporters who manufacture products with high local content are
also expected to feel the pinch of the weak peso because of the
rise in production and transport costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the exporters had already been burdened by the
liquidity crunch which has jacked up interest rates and restricted
businessmen's access to credit, he added.
</P>
<P>
The peso has depreciated from 26.2 pesos per dollar to the
current all-time low of 35.56 pesos to one dollar since the
currency turmoil swept Southeast Asia in early July.
</P>
<P>
Dakay said the exporters favor an exchange rate of one dollar
to 30 pesos and consider a rate beyond this level would hurt the
export sector.
</P>
<P>
They also hope the government will be able to keep the
inflation and interest rates at manageable levels to allow the
export sector to advance, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's export sector grew by an average of 22 percent in
the first eight months this year, the highest growth rate in
Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Hopes to Host World Meeting on Regulating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia hopes to play host
to a world meeting here as soon as possible to study its proposal
for prudential regulations for currency trading, particularly in
relation to hedge trading, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
today.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has asked for a Malaysian to be seconded to the
organization to assist it in looking into ways to regulate
currency trading, Mahathir told reporters after presenting a
keynote address at a seminar on "Strategic Thinking -- Lessons
From Three Great Asian Civilizations For Today's Modern
Management" here.
</P>
<P>
He said that an officer has already been identified to be
seconded to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that when he was in Hong Kong recently, the heads
of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Trade Organization (WTO) were supportive of Malaysia's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia made the proposal following unwarranted speculative
and manipulative attacks on ASEAN currencies starting with the
Thai Baht in early July which adversely affected their economies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that even last night, WTO director-general Renato
Ruggiero phoned his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is also Finance
Minister, informing him of the trade body's support for Malaysia
to initiate controls on currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his keynote address at the one-day seminar, he said
that his government is formulating a strategy which is expected to
successfully deal with the effects of the fall of the Ringgit with
the full cooperation of all Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir did not elaborate on the strategy but gave an
assurance that it would not be detrimental to any party.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Cabinet, at its weekly meeting yesterday,
discussed several strategies but the people's full support and
discipline were required to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are indulging in strategic thinking at the moment. We may
come up with a solution soon. Give the solution a chance and we
will overcome," he said.

<HEADLINE> Castro Insists Cuban Exiles Were Behind Hotel Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's President Fidel Castro
insisted today that a Miami-based Cuban exile group, the Cuban
American National Foundation (CANF), organized a series of small
bomb attacks at hotels in Havana over the last five months.
</P>
<P>
"All these explosions were organized by the Cuban-American
Foundation and we know enough about this and we are absolutely
sure and we can categorically affirm it, there is no doubt,"
Castro, quoted by the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, said.
</P>
<P>
Castro was speaking at the opening of the Communist Party's
Fifth Party Congress in Havana. His address was a seven-hour
review of Cuba's economic and political policy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At least seven small bombs exploded at Cuban tourist hotels and
a restaurant in the four months up to September, and two others
exploded abroad at Cuban tourist offices in Nassua and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
One of the bombs at a Havana hotel on September 4 killed an
Italian businessman and all of the explosions caused slight damage.
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities in September detained Salvadorean Raul
Ernesto Cruz Leon on charges he planted six of the bombs and said
the CANF was behind the attacks. But the CANF, a powerful
anti-government group, denied the charge saying it had nothing to
do with the bombs.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Castro referred to 20 cases of sabotage aimed at
the tourist industry and charged that all of them were "organized
and supplied" from the United States. He reiterated Cuba's demand
that Washington act to stop such attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Make Feasibility Study of Ganges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The feasibility study of the
much-talked Ganges Barrage is likely to start early next year,
said the sources from the Bangladeshi Ministry of Water Resources
Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Ganges Barrage will cost 8 billion U.S. dollars,
according to a preliminary estimate.
</P>
<P>
The project proposal for the feasibility study at a cost of 630
million taka (about 14.19 million dollars) has already finalized.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries and agencies including Japan, Netherlands, ADB
(the Asian Development Bank) and other countries of the European
Union have agreed to finance the study, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study would be completed in phases within three
years.
</P>
<P>
The signing of agreements with the funding countries and the
donor agencies regarding the funding of the feasibility study
would be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The local component of the total cost of the feasibility study
has been fixed at 45 million taka (about 1.01 million dollars).
The remaining amount of 585 million taka (about 13.18 dollars)
will be funded by the donors, the sources stated.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the study will be on social, environmental
and economic implication of the Ganges Barrage. After completion
of the first phase, the second phase, the detailed technical
aspect of the barrage, will start.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges Barrage has become an urgent necessity to save at
least 40 million people living in the south and southwestern parts
of the country from impending social and economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
"After the construction of the Farakka Barrage by India, the
social and economic lives of the people in this part of the
country have been facing a total disaster," a Water Resources
Ministry official said, adding that construction of the Ganges
Barrage could save the area.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Farakka barrage is largely responsible
for the increasing level of salinity in the area. It has damaged
the soil fertility of the area, and it has also been destroying
the Sundarbans, the world's biggest mangrove forest.
</P>
<P>
The Ganges Barrage will be constructed at Pangsha of Rajbari
district.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's new Prime Minister
Surya Bahadur Thapa won a vote of confidence in the Lower House
Thursday, three days after he took over as head of a new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Thapa, president of the National Democratic Party (RPP),
secured 109 votes in the 205-seat Lower House, six more than the
minimum needed to govern the country, Speaker of the Lower House
Ram Chandra Poudel announced.
</P>
<P>
MPs of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML), the ruling partner of the Chand-led coalition government
which was toppled on October 4 by a no-confidence motion tabled by
the Nepali Congress (NC), boycotted the vote.
</P>
<P>
As Thursday is the eighth day of Dashain, the biggest festival
in Nepal, MPs from the CPN-UML asked the speaker of the Lower
House to postpone the vote till the festival is over.
</P>
<P>
But the speaker did not change his mind, saying the prime
minister had made a request that he be allowed to seek a vote of
confidence as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
RPP parliamentary party leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who was
voted out of power by the NC with the support of Thapa and his
followers, also boycotted the vote along with his two supporters.
</P>
<P>
Thapa's government, the sixth in Nepal since 1990, is currently
a coalition of RPP and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, but the NC will
join later.
</P>
<P>
His government must obtain a vote of confidence in the Lower
House within 30 days.

of survival," head of the Indonesian Business Data Center
Christianto said last night.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, if not dealt with properly and quickly, could lead
to political instability, affecting the convening of the People's
Consultative Assembly next March to elect president and vice
president of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto endorsed a decision Wednesday to seek
outside help, including from the IMF, to restore confidence in the
battered Indonesian rupiah (the national currency).
</P>
<P>
But no details were given on how much assistance would be
sought or in what form.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said any package would be far less than the 17.2
billion US dollars received by Thailand, the first Southeast Asian
nation to turn to multilateral agencies after its currency was
browbeaten.
</P>
<P>
Despite several measures adopted by the government to prevent
further depreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar since mid
July, the value of the Indonesian currency has continued to
weaken.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen about 55 percent against the dollar since
the beginning of this year following offshore speculative attacks
on the currency and a rush by local companies to hedge their
foreign borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Economist Raden Pardede said the government's latest move would
help restore confidence, especially among local companies which
had rushed for the US dollar over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Officials here attributed the persistent weakening of the
rupiah over the past few weeks to the increasing demand by local
corporations to purchase dollars to refinance their dollar debts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman for the
Middle East Committee Sudradjat welcomed the plan, saying
long-term loans from international institutions will allow the
government to intervene in the market, so that the rupiah may
reach its reasonable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rino A. Effendi, chief economist at Danareksa
Securities, said that the move should be accompanied by total
economic reformation involving sectors such as banking and
property.
</P>
<P>
"The question in people's mind now is why our economy is so
sensitive to interest rates and currency fluctuation. That means
there is something wrong with our economy. Therefore, economic
reforms in banking and property sectors as well as other sectors
have to be pursued," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the independent economic think tank Econit criticized
the move, saying Indonesia's economic condition does not warrant
IMF and World Bank intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The present currency crisis is still manageable and
Indonesia's economy is not yet in a critical condition," Econit
Director Rizal Ramli said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of the adverse consequences of seeking IMF and
World Bank assistance, such as a sharp fall in economic growth,
declining purchasing power and an increasing number of poor
people.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Anwar Nasution, meanwhile, said the government
must clarify the form of IMF and World Bank assistance so that the
package won't burden Indonesians in the future.
</P>
<P>
"If the assistance is in the form of funds, they will certainly
impose strict conditions and Indonesia will have to bow to
international financial institutions' pressure," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the World Bank's representative in Jakarta
Dennis de Tray said Wednesday any assistance given to Indonesia in
the wake of a currency crisis would be aimed at restoring
confidence rather than providing financial help.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is still quite well financed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Meets President on Government crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
discussed the government crises over the 1998 budget with
President Oscar Luige Scalfano Wednesday, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was expected to update Scalfano on the state of his
majority and the prospects of an agreement with the Communist
Refoundation party over the budget impasse that threatens to
topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Senate Wednesday morning, Prodi renewed his
appeal to the left-wing party to support his government and the
25-trillion-lira budget.
</P>
<P>
A government crisis "would make it less likely for Italians to
get what they have a right to: a country led by an authoritative
and responsible government open to the future and respected by
everyone," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Communist Refoundation opposes the 1998 budget draft, seen by
the government as a key step toward consolidating Italy's effort
to clean up its state accounts and enter the single European
currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We are now on an arduous and difficult journey," Prodi said,
"and we don't want a failure in carrying out the commitments we
have assumed and take Italy back to a time of continuously
changing coalitions and uncertain balances."
</P>
<P>
After Lower House debate Tuesday, the government fought off
attempts by the opposition to call a vote on the situation.

ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Earthquakes have caused greater
damage to central Italy than initial estimates indicate,
said Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today.
</P>
<P>
"We are still assessing the damage; we'll need a few more
days," said Prodi in addressing the senate on the budget crisis

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today Italy is ready to help Saudi Arabia branch out from
its traditional economic reliance on oil.
</P>
<P>
Dini said this as he opened a session of the joint
Italian-Saudi commission designed for closer trade ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Italy is prepared to place its knowhow in smaller industry at
the Saudis' disposal and to set up joint ventures and make direct
investments, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission meeting, chaired by Dini and Saudi Finance
Minister Ibrahim Al Assaf, followed a series of high-level
contacts between the two countries and a visit to Saudi port city
of Jeddah by Dini and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Italian firms are operating in Saudi Arabia, which
is Italy's third biggest oil supplier, after Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Through the work of the commission, the Saudi government
expects not only to diversify its economy, but also to accelerate
the privatization of its petrochemicals, telecommunications and
power sectors. Italy also has started or is planning major
sell-offs in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries amounted to almost 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of Italian exports were engineering
products, 10 percent were chemicals and pharmaceuticals, while 80
percent of Saudi exports were crude oil.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Push Social Insurance Across Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by the success of a
series of experimental social insurance programs in the country,
China is set to greatly expand the coverage of social welfare
schemes across all domestic sectors, according to a spokesman for
the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on pension, unemployment and medical insurance,
the State will also improve industrial accident insurance and
maternity insurance for women workers, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the institutes in charge of running these
social insurance programs are being asked to upgrade management
and improve service, said Dang Xiaojie, the spokesman for the
Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
According to Dang, by the end of last year, more than 87
million workers, or 78 percent of the total work force, had joined
pension insurance schemes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 117.1 billion yuan (14 billion US
dollars) was collected in pension insurance, some 103.1 billion
yuan (12 billion dollars) was paid out.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.31 million people received unemployment payments last
year, an increase of 27 percent over the previous year. With the
help of this money, 1.87 million people were able to find new jobs
last year.
</P>
<P>
Over 31 million workers were covered by industrial accident
insurance last year, a growth of 18.66 percent over 1995's figure,
and the number of female workers taking out maternity insurance
increased by 34.35 percent, surpassing 20 million last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 7.9 million workers were
covered by social medical insurance, an increase of 12.6 percent
over the 1995 figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The motion put forward by 32
members of the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the establishment of the
Wangfujing palaeoanthropological museum gave significant support
to the municipal leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government has now decided to set up the museum,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, remains confirmed as relics from the
Palaeolithic era some 22,000-25,000 years ago were discovered at
the construction site of the Oriental Square Plaza at the south
end of Wangfujing Street.
</P>
<P>
Motions such as the proposal to establish the museum have
played a significant role in helping the capital's governmental
organizations take appropriate decisions and improve their work.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the CPPCC Beijing Committee has received 5,093
motions from its 740 members, up 13.5 percent over the previous
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the motions have been adopted by
governments at different levels, said committee official Shi
Weimin. Some motions have been of particular help to
decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
Eight committee members proposed a motion to strengthen
construction of Beijing's information infrastructure last
year. After the motion was delivered to the municipal government,
Mayor Jia Qinglin immediately decided to give priority to the
information infrastructure as a new aspect of the capital's
economic development.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin told the State Duma (lower house) today that it
should step back from confrontation with the government since new
economic policies are beginning to show results.
</P>
<P>
In a 30-minute speech, Chernomyrdin said foreign investment in
the first half of 1997 has reached 7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic
health, has risen 0.2 percent in the first nine months of the year
against the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production has also risen 1.5 percent in the first
nine months, and he predicted the net grain harvest would be 84 to
85 million tons this year, up to 28 percent more than in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, unsatisfied with the government's 1997 economic
and social policies, threatened to call for a no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested the government bring revenue into state
coffers and suspend the preferential tax and customs policies for
some mainstay enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced the country and the Russian people do not need
the vote or new elections," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Relic Beads Found in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists discovered
19 beads in a reliquary in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, indicating that the Northwest had a thriving Buddhist
culture.
</P>
<P>
The bone beads, the largest of which is about a centimeter in
diameter, were found among ashes left from the cremation of
Buddhas or saintly monks and have archaeological value, the
scholars say.
</P>
<P>
In August, a villager in the town of Bohai unearthed a stone
reliquary containing boxes made of lacquered wood, bronze, gold,
silver, and glass. The glass box had been broken, but the gold one
still shines, according to Tao Gang, director of the Mudanjiang
Cultural Relics Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say that the finds are sacred Buddhist
relics of the Bohai Kingdom, founded by the Mohe people 1,300
years ago. The ancient site is still kept well in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
A silver reliquary was found not far from the latest spot, in
1974, the scholars note.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs 1998 U.S. Military Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed a 247.7 billion U.S. dollar military spending bill
for the 1998 fiscal year starting October 1.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the funding that Congress has added to the bill is
excessive and threatened to veto some items by using the line-item
veto power.
</P>
<P>
The bill contains about 3.2 billion dollars more in funding
than was approved for the previous year. It cuts off funding for
U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president
certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says
the bill in a cautious language.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment
for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to
Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
</P>
<P>
The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than
the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed
"concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto
authority to shrink the bill.
</P>
<P>
"The bill provides 4.2 billion dollars more than I requested in
my 1998 budget, and 1.2 billion dollars more than the levels that
my administration believes were agreed to in the bipartisan budget
agreement" between Congress and the White House, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's emphasis on the 1.2 billion dollars by which the
measure exceeds the bipartisan budget agreement may be a hint as
to how much Clinton would target in a veto.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Clinton used the law to veto 38 spending items in a
military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
The "could-be" vetoed spending items include half a billion
dollars in congressionally added spending on eight C-130J military
transport aircraft not in either the Pentagon's budget request or
in the request Clinton sent to Capitol Hill. The planes are built
in Marietta, Georgia, hometown of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Congress also added 100 million dollars for an LPD-17
amphibious assault ship, to be built near the hometown of
Representative Bob Livingston, Republican from Louisiana and
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and 720 million
dollars for an Aegis destroyer built in the hometown of Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican from Mississippi.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Lawmakers Denounce Oil Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Opposition lawmakers lashed out
at the country's three biggest oil companies for "surreptitiously"
raising fuel prices just hours before a Supreme Court order
stopping any oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
The congressmen said that Caltex, Petron and Shell have
apparently defied the court's ban by increasing an average of 10
centavos (three U.S. cents) per liter in premium and unleaded
gasoline's prices Monday night, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representative Enrique Garcia said he would file contempt
charges against the three major players for abruptly increasing
their prices, adding they should be taught "a lesson".
</P>
<P>
The development also prompted Representative Tessie
Aquino-Oreta to urge the Supreme Court to look into the
possibility that the oil firms have moles inside the court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court issued the order on Tuesday, forbidding any
oil firms to raise prices within 30 days. When the country's
currency of peso is falling sharply, oil price hikes will result
in higher basic commodities prices and finally, a higher inflation
rate.
</P>
<P>
In the face of criticism, the three oil companies refused to go
back to the original prices, arguing that they were not covered by
the ban because the price increases had taken effect before the
court issued the order.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, the country's inflation
rate remained at a low level of 4.7 percent despite the currency
turmoil that has pulled down the peso by 35 percent to the current
record low of 35.6 pesos to one dollar.

<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian warplane today
bombarded a Sierra Leonean army base west of Freetown, killing at
least four people.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers and two civilians were killed and 28 others
injured in the attack, said reports reaching here from Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The plane fired seven rockets and heavily damaged the base
where Sierra Leonean junta leader Major Johnny Koroma and other
high-ranking military officers were about to have a meeting.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Senior NATO Officer in Spain for Command Structure Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
in Europe, Wesley Clark, today urged Spain and Britain to reach
agreement on settling their dispute over Gibralta to facilitate
the reform of NATO command structure.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Madrid, Clark said that the reform of
NATO command structure is imperative and that the dispute between
Spain and Britain over Gibraltar is totally a bilateral issue
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar, a rocky
peninsula at the southern tip of Spain that dominates the western
entrance to the Mediterranean, has posed to be a major obstacle
against the reform of NATO command structure.
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar was ruled by Spain in the mid-15th century and merged
into Spanish territory in 1501. In 1704, Austria captured
Gilbraltar with the joining of Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Gibraltar formally became
a British colony, but Spain has claimed it ever since, generating
regular tensions with Britain.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has expressed his hope
that Spain would join NATO's military command later this year, but
he admitted there would be some hurdles to be overcome first.
</P>
<P>
In London, the British government has threatened to block
Spain's full integration into NATO command structure unless
British military aircraft are allowed to make full use of the
airport on the contested British colony of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Clark, who is a U.S. army general, said
that Spain is experienced in settling regional issues and that the
country should make great contribution in a new NATO command
structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO is discussing the establishment a regional
command in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Clark arrived in Spain Tuesday on the mission to discuss with
the Spanish military the process of Spain's integration into NATO
command structure.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Colombia launched a
construction project today as part of the country's social
spending scheme to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will construct 13,000 low-rent houses in the
next six months, will generate more than 60,000 direct jobs, said
President Ernesto Samper from the Presidential House.
</P>
<P>
The project involves housing construction in 12 states for
families earning a monthly income below 845,900 Colombia pesos
(about 680 U.S. dollars), or four times the Colombian minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The government will put 190 billion pesos (about 152.7 million
dollars) into the project, Samper said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing his government's socially-oriented policy in favor of
the poorest families, Samper said that between August 1994 and
September 1997, his government granted 15,171 houses with an
investment of 190 million dollars, through the National Savings
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The housing policy will be well established within the next 10
years through funds from the private sector and other sectors, he
said.

years, after Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai, and tourism has
become one of its pillar industries.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at a Shanghai tumor
center are saying that, based on research findings, they think
there may be a connection between Epstein-Barr (EB) virus and
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
A group of researchers at the Shanghai Medical University's
Tumor Hospital, led by Xu Liangzhong, a tumor pathologist, studied
EB virus infection in 102 cases of breast cancer and 47 cases of
benign breast tumor. They found that 28.4 percent of the breast
cancer patients have the EB virus while the rate among those with
benign breast tumors was only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The research indicated that the EB virus gene and results of
the virus also existed in breast cancer cells and their
reproduction system.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the EB virus exists on a widely scale in the
world, but its mode of transmission has yet not been discovered
here.
</P>
<P>
China has seen a steady growth of the incidence of breast
cancer in the past three years and it now ranks as one of the top
three killers among cancer in women.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Approves Fast-Track Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- President Clinton's bid for
negotiating authority to create a free-trade area in West
hemisphere passed a key committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives today with most Democrats rejecting his appeal for
support.
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee approved the measure on a
24-14 vote with only four Democrats voting for it.
</P>
<P>
The measure gives the U.S. president the power to negotiate
future free-trade agreements under a "fast-track" process that
requires quick congressional consideration and a yes-or-no vote
without amendments.
</P>
<P>
The legislation that cleared the House committee was a
compromise worked out between Republicans and the administration
and was similar to a measure approved by the Senate Finance
Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow negotiations to ensure that countries
don't seek to lower existing labor and environmental regulations
to gain unfair advantage. But Democratic opponents contended this
did not provide American workers with enough protection against
unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with 10 Democrats in the Ways and Means Committee
Tuesday night to appeal for their votes but only four of them
supported him today.
</P>
<P>
The fast-track process is also strongly opposed by labor
unions, which charge that it opens the way for future trade deals
that will allow U.S. corporations to move more of their factories
to low-wage countries with lax environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
Clinton needs fast-track authority to achieve a key goal of his
second term, preparing the way for a hemisphere-wide free-trade
zone by 2005. The administration has also committed to starting
negotiations to achieve free trade in the Pacific by 2010.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman has agreed to a
one-year contract with reigning National Basketball Association
(NBA) champions Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, the NBA rebounding champion for each of the past six
years, was seeking a 10 million-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls wanted a contract loaded with incentives that would
boost Rodman's payoff if he stayed out of trouble, avoided the
suspensions and injuries that plagued him much of last season.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Rodman had suggested the Bulls not pay him
until the end of the season, holding 10 million dollars in reserve
and deducting money from the sum for fines and suspensions. NBA
rules forbid such a move.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons that the Bulls are interested in Rodman is
Scottie Pippen got injuried. Pippen underwent foot surgery on
Monday and might not be back in uniform until mid-January. The new
season opens October 31.

Federation (FIA) ommited the French Grand Prix from the 1998's
Formula One world championship calendar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Regis, president of the French Automobile Federation
(FFSA), said that the FIA had decided to exclude France in the
calendar according to a dispute over television rights.
</P>
<P>
French channel TF1 has the rights for Formula One in France but
French state channel FR3 obtained a judgement allowing all the TV
channels to operate on the site.
</P>
<P>
Last year the French Grand Prix was given a tentative spot on
the calendar and the problems were resolved to hold th erace.
</P>
<P>
The FIA had warned that unless the conflict was resolved France
would not appear on the 1998 calendar.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time the French Grand Prix was taken off
the schedule. In 1992 FIA was threatened with law suits by the
anti-tabacco law because of cigarette sponsorship showing on
cars.

<HEADLINE> China Successful in Seedless-Grape Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A new variety of seedless grape
has been developed in east China's Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
Three years of experiments have shown that the seedless grapes
weigh more than 20 g. on average and some even as much as 30 g.,
compared to 2 to 4 g. for ordinary seedless grapes each.
</P>
<P>
The new grape is the brainchild of Zhong Jiahuang, a professor
at Anhui Agriculture University, who found a new way to get
varieties of grapes with seeds to bear seedless fruit.
</P>
<P>
The Jingya variety produces 95 percent seedless grapes and has
a maturation time that is 10 days earlier than usual, greatly
improving economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The grape is also suited to the weather conditions of south
China, unlike other seedless types.

<P>
LHASA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Many modern cities thrive
alongside the Yarlung Zangbo River, southeast of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, stimulating the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Neat, wide roads have taken place of muddy, bumpy paths. Street
vendors continue their businesses in newly-completed shopping
malls. Broadcasting towers have been built against the backdrop of
the blue sky and snow-topped mountain peaks.
</P>
<P>
The polished appearance is commonplace now in Nyingchi and
Shannan prefectures, which just a few years ago were backward and
remote.
</P>
<P>
For the past year, the local government of Nyingchi has poured
120 million yuan (about 14.4 million US dollars) into road
construction as well as sewage treatment, telecommunications and
other community facilities.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Shannan Prefecture has also earmarked 180 million
yuan (21.7 million US dollars) as infrastructure investment. A
primary school and a hospital were put into use this year.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement of infrastructure conditions has already
brought us profits," said Qian Xianfa, secretary of Gyaca County
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"The flourishing service sector is also accelerating the
development of local economy," said Qian, citing that his county's
industrial and commercial tax revenue increased by 58 percent from
the last year.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the town of Gyaca had only seven shops -- now
there are 70.
</P>
<P>
Bayi Town in Nyingchi County even sketched out a blueprint for
commercial, industrial development, cultural and living areas.
Local officials said the town will expand to 70 square kilometers
in the future, from the current four square kilometers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A high-level trade delegation
from eastern China's Jiangxi Province opened an exhibition in the
World Trade Center here today, with the aim of attracting more
foreign investments to the province.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by the province's vice-governor Huang
Zhiquan, is the province's largest measured by the sizes of the
projects it offers.
</P>
<P>
Huang said at the opening ceremony that Jiangxi, which used to
lag behind its neighbors such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang province,
are catching up these years. The completion of the
Beijing-Kowloon railway, which runs through the province from
north to south, has brought a lot of opportunities to Jiangxi,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The province has also improved the foundation of transport and
energy systems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Vaughu Koshkarian, vice-president of the Fort Motor Corp.,
briefed the attendants their success in Jiangsu. The U.S. auto
maker has bought 20 percent of the shares of the Jiangsu Jiangling
Motor Co.. The first Fort designed van is scheduled to roll off
the production line December 2.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi authorities wish to use the Fort story to gain more
investment. They have brought more than 100 projects with each
needing millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover wide ranges, including highway construction,
power supply, farming, chemical engineering, metallurgy,
electronics, textiles and tourism. The Guixi Power Plant needs
325 million U.S. dollars to install two 300,000 kw thermal power
generator sets. The Ganbei Chemical Plant is looking for 110
million U.S. dollars to buy technology and key equipment for
producing new products.

<HEADLINE> Canadians to Slow Spending Next Year, Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Low personal savings and high
debt loads, combined with higher interest rates, will slow the
growth in Canadian household spending next year, an economic
think-tank said today.
</P>
<P>
"The consumer is leading the way in 1997," said Jim Frank,
vice-president and chief economist of the Conference Board of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Housing starts are strong, retail sales are rising, and auto
sales are on track for their strongest growth in over a decade,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"With continued stellar job creation, consumer confidence is at
an eight-year high," Frank said while releasing the board's
Canadian Outlook for this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
The board forecasts a 3.4 percent HDP growth for Canada this
year and 3.1 percent growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Though income prospects for next year are better than at any
time this decade, interest rates are expected to rise by 50 basis
points over the next few months, according to the board.
</P>
<P>
"With total consumer debt now exceeding 96 percent of
disposable income, rising interest rates will make personal
debt-servicing costs more onerous," Frank noted.
</P>
<P>
Yet, strong wage gains and moderate inflation will help lift
real personal disposable income to 2.6 percent next year, the best
performance in eight years, he added.

NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Stocks fell sharply today as
Alan Greenspan dampened investor optimism with another warning
about inflationary pressures and market exuberance.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 83.25 points to
8,095.06.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 2-to-1

</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 9.28 to 973.84, and
the NYSE composite index fell 4.64 to 509.57, but the Nasdaq
composite index rose 4.50 to 1,741.77.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 slipped 0.12 to 463.66, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index fell 3.60 to 718.30, snapping a string of
seven closing highs by measure, which is dominated by smaller
companies.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators also sank as the latest congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan pulled down the
bond market which rallied recently.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, warning that the current economic good times could
be cut short if inflationary pressures emerge, told the House
Budget Committee that it may be only a matter of time until tight
labor markets force wages higher.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury rose as
high as 6.36 percent from late Tuesday's 6.23 percent, which was
it's lowest finish since February 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Again Fails to Break Campaign Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
again failed to break a Republican filibuster holding up action on
a bill designed to revise campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
That 52-47 vote was eight short of the 60 needed to end debate
and proceed with the measure. Majority Republicans declared it
dead after a nearly identical vote on the bill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Today's vote was part of a move by Democrats to keep pressing
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vote, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott flatly
declared the measure "dead," saying its proposed ban on
unregulated "soft" political donations contradicts the Supreme
Court's finding that such funds are a protected form of free
speech. "Soft" donations, used for generic party activities,
differ from "hard" contributions, which are used to back a
particular campaign and which the court says can be restricted.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that the legislation "is not going to going to pass."
</P>
<P>
Lott called it "a diversionary tactic," and that Democrats are
trying to shift attention away from questions about fund-raising
in President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said Republicans are defending a system favoring
Republicans.

<HEADLINE> 538 PKK Rebels Killed in Turkish Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 538 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in the
Turkish military operation in northern Iraq since late last
month, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that figures issued by the Turkish General
Staff show that nine PKK militants were captured and 12 others
surrendered to the Turkish troops in the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish General Staff failed to mention the
casualties of the Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, around 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by jets
and artillery fire, launched a cross-border operation in northern
Iraq aimed at smashing newly-built PKK camps there.
</P>
<P>
In the operation, Turkish Air Force jets bombed 15 PKK camps
near the Iranian and Syrian borders.
</P>
<P>
Describing the PKK as a threat to Turkey's border security,
Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier that the Turkish military
had the right to take such actions to defend state interests.
</P>
<P>
Last May, Turkey sent as many as 50,000 troops into northern
Iraq in a massive cross-border operation, dealing a heavy blow on
the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Turkish military operation has triggered severe
criticism from Iran and some Arab countries, which accused Ankara
of violating Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old war against the
Turkish authorities for the establishment of an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Free Banking Urged for GCC Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) is considering to allow banks of each
GCC country operate in the other member countries.
</P>
<P>
Central bank and monetary institution chiefs of GCC members
today put forward the recommendation for each GCC country to
license the operation of bank branches of other members.
</P>
<P>
The bank governors, who just concluded their 25th meeting in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, have referred the recommendation to the GCC
economic and foreign ministers for approval, according to Kuwait
News Agency reports from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Central Bank governor and chairman of the
governors' meeting Abdullah Al-Ateyya said the measures would
serve the objective to open GCC banking branches sought by the
member states in order to achieve the unified economic agreement
advocated since the founding of the GCC in 1981.
</P>
<P>
GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain. Kuwait and Qatar have successfully linked
their banks' auto tellers.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ateyya expressed hope that the rest of the GCC member states
would join and complete such GCC bank-net, saying such step would
expand banking services for the interests of the GCC citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti Central Bank governor Sheikh Salem Abdel
Aziz Al-Sabah expressed belief that the GCC countries would be
able to join the Kuwait-Qatar network within two years.
</P>
<P>
Just a number of technical obstacles are hindering the linkage of
network among the GCC countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on to Promote an Ethos of Disaster Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called on all states to intensify their work of
promoting an ethos of disaster prevention in order to build a
safer world for the twenty-first century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the occasion of International day for Natural
Disaster Reduction, October 8, the UN chief said this year's
observation shined a spotlight on the role of water in natural
disasters. Earthquakes, cyclones and volcanic eruptions may be
among the most dramatic natural hazards, but water-lated disasters
-- from floods and drought to desertification -- affected more
people and caused more damage. The focus on water was especially
timely.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said floods were occurring more
frequently than other disasters, a trend attributable to many
causes, including deforestation and rapid development, especially
in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Annan said but drought and desertification were also on the
rise. Drought was also a leading killer, causing the deaths of a
reported 74,000 people in 1976. Desertification were affecting one
fourth of the earth's land and more than one billion of the
world's people, and cost 42 billion U.S. dollars each year in lost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
He said deforestation was a major contributing factor, along
with other poor land use practice such as overgrazing,
over-cultivation and mismanagement of irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations was fully engaged in efforts to
help countries cope with natural disasters and incorporate
disaster reduction and preparedness into their overall development
plans. In 1989, as a spur to international action and cooperation,
the General Assembly proclaimed the International Decade for
Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-2000). Throughout the 1990s,
United Nations conferences on the environment, pollution, human
settlements and other issues stressed the links between disaster
reduction and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said since the World Conference on Natural
Disaster Deduction held in 1994 in Japan, many countries had
adopted new laws and national strategies for disaster reduction,
preparedness and mitigation. The United Nations, for its part, had
carried out disaster management training programs in dozens of
countries, focusing on institution-building, early warning,
network between institutions and individuals, and the production
and dissemination of training materials.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said that when disaster stroke, the
Organization arranged for relief shipments, launched international
appeals for assistance and served as a clearinghouse for
information about needs and consequences.
</P>
<P>
He said the world was facing a paradox with water-lated
disasters: too much water, and too little. Virtually every country
was facing the prospect of both flood and water shortage. Such
disasters knew no borders. Floods and droughts often affected
several countries at once.
</P>
<P>
He called for international cooperation to reduce the loss of
life, property damage, and economic and social disruptions caused
by natural disasters and environmental emergencies.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Apologizes Again Over Attack in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu phoned Jordanian King Hussein this evening,
apologizing again over the Israeli agents' attack on a Hamas
leader last month in Amman, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he was really sorry that the incident has
caused so much trouble and damage to the Israeli-Jordanian
relations and pledged that Israel will do its best to improve the
relationship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under a Hussein-brokered bargain, the two Israeli agents who
attacked Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) leader Khaled Mashaal
last month in Amman were released in exchange for the release of
Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who was jailed by Israel in
1989 for ordering attacks by Hamas guerrillas against Israeli
targets.
</P>
<P>
Israel also freed Tuesday nine Jordanian detainees in Israel in
a bid to improve its ties with Jordan, which went strained
following the failed attack.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was one of the two Arab countries to sign peace
treaties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said in Amman today that he had told Israel two
days before the attack that Hamas is willing to have a truce with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu told Hussein that he received the message
only after the attack, otherwise, the incident would not occur,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister has appointed a three-member
committee to probe this incident.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli opposition parties, including the Labor Party,
have stepped up their attack on Netanyahu for authorizing such a
attack in a friendly country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are calling for a state inquiry headed
by a judge with authority to subpoena witnesses.
