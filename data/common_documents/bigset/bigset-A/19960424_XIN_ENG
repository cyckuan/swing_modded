<HEADLINE> Georgian President Visits NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Georgia is interested in closer
ties with NATO through the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program,
but opposes the expansion of the alliance, President Eduard
Shevardnadze said here today.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Georgian president made the remarks after a
meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana on bilateral
relations and the mechanisms of the PfP.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between NATO and Georgia is being absolutely
normalized," said Shevardnadze who arrived here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Georgia's opposition to NATO's expansion,
Shevardnadze said: "As far as the enlargement is concerned, it
should be effected in such a way that it should not lead us to a
new type of confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"Of great importance, I think, will be the intensification and
deepening of cooperation between NATO and Russia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that NATO hopes to cooperate with Georgia
"bilaterally and regionally" and that he will visit Georgia as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Separatist Leader Dudayev Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev has been killed during a missile strike from
Russian troops, the Itar-Tass news agency reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
It quotd Dudayev's government as saying that he was killed
on the night from April 21 to 22 near the village of Gekhi Chu,
some 30 kilometers southwest of the Chechen capital of Grozny,
after the missile strike.
</P>
<P>
The Dudayev government's statement on his death was
reportedly delivered to the Itar-Tass office in Grozny by the
former leader of the Dudayev delegation to the 1995 negotiations
with Moscow, Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov.
</P>
<P>
"Dudayev is dead, there is no doubt about it," Yarikhanov
stated.
</P>
<P>
State-run television stations here have confirmed the reports
on Dudayev's death.
</P>
<P>
Some of Dudayev's closest associates reportedly died together
with the Chechen separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 51, had been at the head of the Chechen separatist
movement since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. For the
past 16 months, he had led armed resistance to the Russian troops
which operated in the local republic to preserve Russia's
territorial integrity against armed Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports about Dudayev's death have been disputed
by a number of sources, and the Grozny-based pro-Moscow
government of Chechnya has begun checking out the facts. Russian
military sources said they had no immediate information about
the alleged rocketing of Gekhi Chu on April 21-22.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Satisfied with Missile Talks with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
expressed satisfaction with the first round of missile talks with
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies told a press
briefing that the two-day talks in Berlin on Saturday and Sunday
were useful and set a good beginning for further talks between the
two sides on the missile issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is interested in continuing the
discussions, Davies said, adding that the U.S. goal is to
encourage DPRK to join a multilateral group seeking to curb the
international missile trade.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated denials by Pyongyong, Washington has been
alleging that DPRK has sold long-range Scud missiles to Iran and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government would like to have a DPRK commitment to
stop both the export and production of missiles, Davies said.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin talks, the first of its kind between Washington and
Pyongyong, were sponsored by the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman noted that the talks were unrelated to
the latest proposal by the United States and South Korea to hold a
four-way talks on the future of the Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> US Farm Debt to Hit 10-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Business-related farm debt in
the U.S. is likely to hit a 10-year record but remain far under
the peak set in 1984, the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Farm debt is expected to reach 154.6 billion U.S. dollars by
the end of the year and that would be the sixth increase in seven
years following five straight years in which payoffs exceeded new
loans, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
"Continued economic growth, high grain prices, expanded acreage
for some crops and stable farm incomes are behind much of this
year's expected expansion," the USDA concluded.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, total farm debt at the end of 1996 is expected to
be 20 percent below the 1984 record. In percentage terms, the USDA
added, debt increases in the 1990s remain well under levels of the
1970s, when debt grew by more than 10 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
Little growth is expected in borrowing for real estate this
year and the increase will be caused by new loans for equipment
and purposes other than real estate. Even so, more and more of the
demand for credit for equipment and machinery is being met by
dealers through a combination of leasing and trade credit.
</P>
<P>
Most commercial farm-credit lenders are expected to be strong
financially this year, the USDA said.

<HEADLINE> Nepalese Forfeits Savings in Indian Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Many Nepalese citizens having
deposit accounts in various banks in an Indian border city have
forfeited their savings, Nepal's official news agency RSS said
today.
</P>
<P>
The exact amount seized by the Indian Income Tax Department
from these banks and the number of Nepalese depositors losing
their money were yet to be known, but it was estimated that about
1,300 Nepalese had forfeited around four million Indian rupees
(more than 100,000 US dollars) in the State Bank of India in the
Indian city of Jogbani near the border.
</P>
<P>
According to RSS, Nepalese businessmen, politicians and social
workers living in the eastern Morang district often have saving
accounts in banks in bordering Indian towns.
</P>
<P>
Even the Nepalese people working in India and former Gorkha
soldiers who had served in Indian army had lost their money, RSS
said.
</P>
<P>
An existing Nepal-India treaty prescribes forfeiture of the
property possessed by Nepalese and Indian citizens in each other's
countries, but the same treaty prohibits India from applying its
income tax act to Nepalese depositors, it added.
</P>
<P>
An Indian bank officer, quoted by RSS, said that many Nepalese
deposit their money in Indian banks for fear of possible
devaluation of the Nepalese rupee against Indian rupee.
</P>
<P>
The problem arose because the Nepalese account holders did not
fill a special form in accordance with an Indian foreign exchange
regulation act, it was said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Falls in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit dropped
by 17.1 percent in February to 8.2 billion U.S. dollars from a
revised January deficit of 9.9 billion dollars, the Commerce
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods rose 1.4 percent to 49.7 billion dollars in
February, the second best showing on record, while exports of
services went up 3.3 percent to 18.4 billion dollars, an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
The marked increase in exports of goods was due to a rise of
743 million dollars in sales of civilian aircraft, a 108-million-
dollar increase in the sale of American tobacco products abroad
and a gain of 102 million dollars in sales of oil drilling
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods declined 0.9 percent to 63.5 billion dollars
while imports of services rose by 1.4 percent to 12.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline in imports was due to a 156-million-dollar drop in
shipments of foreign computer chips and a 22-million-dollar
decrease in imports of foreign cars.
</P>
<P>
But car exports dropped by 70 million dollars to 5.3 billion
dollars in the month, leaving the U.S. deficit in cars and car
parts at 5.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another big deficit category, oil imports, declined 13.8
percent to 3.64 billion dollars, the smallest monthly figure since
last October.
</P>
<P>
Even with the monthly improvement, the deficit for the first
two months of 1996 is running at an annual rate of 108.4 billion
dollars, only 3.1 billion dollars less than the 111.5 billion
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan rose 2.7 percent in February
to 3.9 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth rate of Germany
will be less than 1 percent this year, instead of the 1.5 percent
forecast earlier, Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the Free Democratic Party, Rexrodt
said the economic situation in the latter half of the year will be
better than the first half, adding that the growth rate in 1997
can reach 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Theo Waigel agreed that the present
economic slowdown is not a recession, but a temporary weakness.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, businessmen are more pessimistic. The Federation
of German Industries said a recession is still possible. Though
interest rates were cut again recently, the public doubt whether
there will be any growth at all.
</P>
<P>
The federation also urges the government to control wage rises.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 431 enterprises shows that the present economic
situation is worse than last fall. Investment and orders are
slipping, and there are again more companies firing than hiring
workers since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Oil Shortage Affects Mongolia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's oil reserves this
year have dropped to the lowest level in recent years and the
shortage of oil will cause difficulty to the country's economic
development, Mongolian businessmen warned.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from officials of the Mongolian Oil Import and
Export Corporation, the country's biggest state-run oil supplier,
in a letter to the State Great Hural (the country's parliament)
and government.
</P>
<P>
The officials of the corporation blamed the oil shortage on the
government's restrictions on the prices of oil products.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, they asked the Great Hural and the government to
lift the restrictions and allocate more money to increasing the
reserves of oil products, which would guarantee the normal
operation and security of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
They complained in the letter that the government's decision in
1994 to fix the prices of oil products in an effort to control
inflation had brought great losses to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, the corporation suffered a loss of 2.3 billion
tugriks (about 5.75 million U.S. dollars) because of the decision.
</P>
<P>
As Mongolia is not capable of turning out oil products itself
at present, the corporation's operation has a direct bearing on
the development of the country's economy.

PHNOM PENH, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work
together with Cambodia to promote their neighborly relations and
cooperation, a senior official of the Chinese Central Military
Commission said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military
Commission, told Cambodian co-defense ministers Tea Banh and Tea
Chanrath that the Chinese government, the Chinese army and the
Chinese people attach great importance to developing friendly
neighborly relations with Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who arrived here Monday for a four-day visit at the
invitation of Tea Banh and Tea Chanrath, stressed that China in
its national defense follows a defensive policy and pursues no
hegemonism and military expansion.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will never join any organization of
military alignment and will never send troops or build military
bases abroad.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed appreciation of the "one China" policy pursued
by the Royal Government of Cambodia, saying "China has regarded
this position as effective support to China for the cause of
unification."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's stand of "peaceful reunification, one
country and two systems" on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>

rehabilitation effort under the leadership of King Norodom
Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Zhang also met with Cambodia's second Prime
Minister Hun Sen.
</P>

Asia-Pacific region for its development and stability and in world
affairs.

BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown in the
Netherlands' industrial growth rate in 1995 appears to have
continued in the first two months of this year, Statistics
Netherlands reported today.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the weaker growth in industrial output to the
poor performance of the timber and building materials industry
whose output fell some 20 percent due to the severe winter.
</P>
<P>
In addition, production in the chemical industry fell by two
percent and in the rubber and plastics processing industry by six
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, production in the food, beverages and tobacco industry
rose by 3.4 percent, while output in the printing industry went up
by 3 percent and in the metal industry by 2.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China took in 133.3 billion yuan
in industrial and commercial taxes in the first quarter of this
year, about 28 percent more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This represents about 22 percent of the total expected this

east China, in southwest China's Guizhou Province, and in
northwest China Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region taxes rose by more than 40 percent.

SEOUL, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chang Hak-ro, former secretary of
South Korean President Kim Young-sam, admitted the bribery charges
brought against him in a hearing at the Seoul District Court here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was arrested and indicted on bribery charges last
month, testified during the questioning by prosecutors that of the
3.55 million U.S. dollars he received from 14 domestic firms since
January 1990, about 970,000 U.S. dollars could be considered
bribes, or money given in exchange for his influences as a

<P>
He submitted, through his defense lawyer, a document certifying
that he has contributed 1.5 million U.S. dollars to the rural
youth education and development foundation.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to Kim in 1977 and was his "steward"

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warships today continued
to bombard the main coastal road, forcing a halt in traffic
between the Lebanese capital of Beirut and the south.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the southern region was facing serious food and
fuel shortages due to the Israeli blockade which began on April
19.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said the Israeli shelling hit a
white Mercedez car today near Awali Bridge area, some four
kilometers north of Sidon, causing three people wounded,
including a four-year-old child. The Israeli warships also
shelled the coastal road linking Sidon and the southern port city
of Sour, some 85 kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Some government officials worried that the supply of fuel
would not last long despite the rationing of petrol and diesel
oil in these region.
</P>
<P>
Food shortage was more serious and has caused some refugees in
starvation. In the port city of Sidon, some 300,000 refugees
would consume 200 tons of flour, 75,000 liters of petrol and
20,000 liters of diesel each day.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli blockade of the coastal road also caused shortages
of medical equipment, medicine and children's food in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the Israeli continuous shelling of the main coastal
road, few relief supplies could reach the hands of the
refugees. It is the only road that links Beirut with the south,"
Lebanese Economic Minister Yassin Jaber told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a naval blockade on some Lebanese port
cities since April 13, claiming the move was aimed at preventing
the transport of weapons to the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, by sea.
</P>
<P>
It is the 13th successive day today of the Israeli attacks on
Lebanon since the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath started on
April 11. More than 150 people have been killed and hundreds of
others have been wounded. The Israeli attacks also triggered the
exodus of nearly 500,000 refugees, about an eighth of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intensive diplomatic efforts to end the fighting
beteen Israel and Hezbollah, the cross-border exchanges of
gunfire were still continuing today.

<HEADLINE> EU Ban Likely to Be Lifted Next Week: UK Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg has expressed the hope that the worldwide ban on
British beef exports imposed by the European Union (EU) is likely
to be lifted next week.
</P>
<P>
Hogg made the statement after a three-hour meeting with EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler in Brussels, according to
a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
"The EU Council of Ministers is likely to move to support a
relaxation of the ban because of the steps we have taken," Hogg
said.
</P>
<P>
Hogg stressed that the British government would "need to devise
a water-tight system." He also expressed the conviction that the
new system would be acceptable to people who had examined it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fischler insisted that measures must be enforced. He
added that controls had to convince people that the prerequisite
for lifting the ban could well be in place.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Fischler, Hogg reportedly put forward a
highly selective slaughter of cattle in exchange for an early
lifting of the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Under the British proposal, some 40,000 cows aged three to six
years which are most at risk from developing BSE or the mad cow
disease will be slaughtered, cutting the number of cases of BSE
this year and next by up to 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Government Checks Out Reports about Dudayev's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Moscow Chechen government
said today that it is checking out facts relating to the reports
about the death of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Sherip Mamadkhadzhiyev, deputy prime minister of the Chechen
government, told Itar-Tass through telephone, "Today we will be
conducting checks of the statement using both official channels
and through civilians."
</P>
<P>
"It is hardly likely that anything will be made certain before
tomorrow morning," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Kremlin officials stressed the need to check out the
real fact.
</P>
<P>
The duty officer at the headquarters of the Russian forces in
Chechnya told Itar-Tass that he had no confirmed information about
Dudayev's death as a result of a missile strike near the village
of Gekhi Chu, 30 kilometers southwest of the Chechen capital of
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Gekhi Chu was rocketed late on April 21 or early
on April 22, the duty officer said he was not in a position to
give an immediate answer.
</P>
<P>
The news of Dudayev's death came from a statement of Dudayev's
"government of Ichkeri" delivered to the Itar-Tass office in
Grozny by Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, the former leader of the
Dudayev delegation to the 1995 negotiations with Moscow which went
bust after a number of acts of terror staged by pro-Dudayev
militants.
</P>
<P>
Yarikhanov said the dead body was kept near the village of
Gekhi Chu and several men from among Dudayev's closest entourage,
including his aide Dukvakha Ibragimov, had died together with the
Chechen separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
The "government of Ichkeria" announced three days of mourning
for Dudayev, noting in its statement that "26 April 1996 will be a
day for religious arrangements on the occasion of the tragic death
of President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria Dzhokhar
Dudayev."
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 51, a former Soviet general who had made a name for
himself during the Afghanistan war, led the Chechen separatist
movement to break away from Russia. For the past 16 months, he
directed the armed resistance to the Russian forces which entered
Chechnya at the end of 1994 to protect Russia's territorial
integrity against Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is
now in Khabarovsk in Russia's Far East on his way to China for a
three-day official visit, was informed without delay about media
reports about Dudayev's death.
</P>
<P>
The news agency cited sources close to the Russian president as
noting that the reports about Dudayev's death "need additional
verification and there is no sense in commenting on them until
they are either confirmed or rejected."

LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Council of the
National parent-teacher ssociation of Nigeria is to hold its 20th
congress here to discuss the situation in primary, secondary and
tertiary institutions, a senior association official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled to start Wednesday in Lagos, will be
attended by all the states and local government branches, said
Laja Idowu Taiwo, National General Secretary of the association.
</P>

The meeting is imperative because of the "ominous

to find a lasting solution to the problems, he noted.

Over the past two years, the association has been calling for
a well "packaged educational rescue summit" to reviw the
country's school education.

The official flayed the decision by the federal ministry of
education to hold a forum on management and finding of education
on May 17 instead of a summit.
</P>
<P>
The educational system of the country has been inundated with
strikes, closure of school, inadequate funding, examination

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Turkey's Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today
rejected Turkey's protest Monday over an incident in the Aegean,
describing it as "a display of bad faith."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Nikos Athanassakis said that Turkey's
claims were "totally inaccurate."
</P>
<P>
A Greek coastguard vessel fired warning shots early Monday to
stop a Turkish speedboat which had allegedly landed eight illegal
Iranian immigrants on the island near the island of Kastellorizo
in the southeastern Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Coastguard officers arrested the illegal immigrants -- three
men, two women and three children, who are being held on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Ankara said that the speedboat was a fishing vessel inside
Turkish waters at the time of the incident and "was followed
inside Turkish territorial waters and harassed."
</P>
<P>
It also claimed that the boat was shot at 10-15 times resulting
in the injury of a fisherman.
</P>
<P>
Athanassakis said that Greece had rejected Turkey's protest. He
added that in the period 1992-1995 alone, a total of 22,906
illegal immigrants had entered Greece from Turkey, of whom 4,361
had entered the country from the islands and sea regions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that there was a problem of illegal
immigrants and Turkey refused to enter into a dialogue on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Seven African Countries To Get Rid Of IDDS By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and six other African
countries could be rid of Iodine Deficiency Diseases (IDDS) by
the year 2000, a health expert said at a conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Director of the International Council for the
Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD ), Francois
Delange, made the statement in accordance with the results of the
studies carried out recently.
</P>
<P>
The other countries where studies were carried out were Kenya,
Cameroon, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zaire and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the conference on the ''Sustainable
Elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorders In Africa By The Year
2000'', Delange said sufficient intakes of iodine could ensure
the elimination of IDDS.
</P>
<P>
Iodine is a nutrient needed by the body in small quantities
for human development, and if deficient, the victims suffers
various diseases including goitres and cretinism.
</P>
<P>
Iodine intake can, however, be boosted by taking iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
Delange said, ''The World Health Organisation, United Nations
Children's Fund and ICCIDD undertook a multi-centre study on the
impact of salt iodization on iodine nutrition in seven African
countries, having theoretically in common that they were supplied
with the same source of iodized salt as Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which started on Monday, seeks to
map out strategies for the elimination of IDDS in Africa by the
year 2000. About 181 million people are said to be at risk of
IDDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by about 200 people from 47
African countries.

<HEADLINE> Least Developed Countries Show Modest Growth, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua)-- The economies of Least Developed
Countries (LDCS) in the world displayed ''modest progress'' in the
past two years after several years of stagnation, with estimated real
Gross Domestic Product averaging three percent, the annual report of
a United Nations Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in a
press statement in the Namibia's capital Windhoek that least
developed countries' 1996 report showed there had been marked
improvement in the economic growth of the world LDCS, reported the
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNCTAD statement, the African LDCS were estimated
to have attained an average growth of 2.2 percent in 1995, while
Asian LDCS recorded estimated growth of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of growth in African LDCS was largely attributed
to improved commodity prices, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that opportunities and risks facing LDCS around the world
were to be discussed at UNCTAD's ninth ministerial session, scheduled
to be held in Midrand near Johannesburg from April 27 to May 11.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N.report, 33 of the world's 48 least developed
countries are in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Official: Turkish-Israeli Military Agreement Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Undersecretary
Anwar Ayman said here today that the recently concluded military
cooperation agreement between Turkey and Israel is not directed
against the interests of any Arab or neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, the Turkish official said that the widely reported
agreement is not aimed to forge a strategic alliance between
Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Turkey has merely normalized its relations
with Israel as several Arab states have already done.
</P>
<P>
Ayman, currently on a visit to Egypt, said that Turkey and
Israel signed the agreement on military training against the
background of normalized relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reached similar agreements with 16 other countries,
including Egypt and some other Arab states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on reports that under its military agreement
with Israel, Turkey might call on the Jewish state to help it
launch air raids against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, Ayman
said the reports were erroneous and unfounded.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in need of cooperation with Israel to combat
terrorism in the region, be it in Iraqi territories or elsewhere,
as this is not the objective of cooperation with Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Lebanon, the Turkish official said
that Turkey hopes Israeli military offensives against Lebanese
civilians will end immediately so that the Middle East peace
process can be maintained.

<P>
NICOSIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said here today the government paid special attention to the
industrial sector in order to create necessary conditions for "new
prospects in the European market."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the annual general meeting of
the Cyprus Industrialists and Employers Federation, the president
described the Cyprus economy as "satisfactory," saying that the
growth rate in 1995 was around 5 percent, which almost doubles
that of the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Inflation went down by 2.6 percent satisfying Maastricht
criteria for the first time, Clerides said, noting that the public
deficit is estimated at 1.3 percent of the Gross National Product
(GNP_, compared to an average of 4.7 percent in the EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
"In 1995, Cyprus managed to satisfy all Maastricht criteria, a
target only met by Luxembourg and to a certain extent Ireland and
Germany of all European Union members," the president said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted the need of focusing more efforts "on
managing long-standing problems faced by the economy such as the
low level of technology and productivity and the high production
costs, which lead to the undermining of the competitiveness of
Cypriot products, especially in the field of manufacturing".

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Wants to Amend Military Agreement with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said today that it wants
to amend the military agreement with Britain under which British
military aircraft are allowed to use airports of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said that the Cyprus government wants to
amend the agreement and let the Britons use only the airport of
the southern town of Larnaca because of the military works
currently underway near Paphos airport, on the island's western
coast.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the agreement with the British bases on the
island was reached in 1985. Until 1987, the agreement provided for
 the use of Larnaca International Airport by British military
aircraft. Since 1987, they have been using Paphos International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives the British bases the right to use the
Cypriot airports for training purposes and for alternative
landings in cases of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added this agreement is quite different from the
case of the Israeli aircraft which were granted permission on two
occasions in 1995 to use Cyprus' sovereign air space and conduct
mock touch-downs and take-offs from Paphos airport.
</P>
<P>
He revealed Monday that the Cyprus authorities rejected on
three occasions "an Israeli request to use Paphos airport for the
same purpose in 1996 because of infrastructure work in close
proximity to the airport for the construction of a military base."
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial power in Cyprus, has retained two
sovereign military bases on the island's southern coast, as well
as other facilities, under the 1960 treaty of establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.

<HEADLINE> Yandarbiyev Succeeds Dudayev as Rebel Chechen Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, one of the
rebel Chechen leaders, has succeeded the late Chechen separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in his post as the head of the Chechen
Republic of Ichkeria, the Itar-Tass news agency reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Khozh-Akhmend Yarikhanov, who led Dudayev's delegation to the
1995 negotiations with Moscow, said that the decision on the
succession was made by the separatist Military Council Monday, "in
keeping with the Constitution of Ichkeria."
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev had been vice-president of the Chechen Republic of
Ichkeria.
</P>
<P>
Yarikhanov said that Dudayev died as a result of a missile
attack launched by Russian forces against the area near the
village of Gekhi Chu late Sunday. he said he had seen "Dudayev's
dead body with his own eyes."
</P>
<P>
According to him, Dudayev arrived at the village located 35
kilometers southwest of the Chechen capital of Grozny together
with his wife Alevtina and put up with his bodyguards in the house
of prosecutor Magomed Djzniyev.
</P>
<P>
A satellite communication session was scheduled for Sunday
evening with the person who was to discuss terms of negotiations
on the Chechen settlement proposed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev and his aide Dukvakha Ibragimov left the house where
his wife remained and moved out into the nearby field. The missile
strike which proved fatal for Dudayev hit the area at that moment.
Dudayev was seriously wounded and died on the same day, Yarikhanov
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Dudayev's death, the government of Ichkeria
described his death as "another terrorist act" and declared that
the strike had come "at a time when Dudayev was discussing with an
intermediatory by telephone conditions for the negotiations
proposed by Moscow."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Russian President Boris Yeltsin's peace plan for
Chechnya announced on March 31 as a peace of "cynical
demagoguery," it declared, "We are calling on the people of
Chechnya to rally together in the struggle to defend the
fatherland."
</P>
<P>
The government of Ichkeria proclaimed a three-day mourning for
Dudayev starting Wednesday. The funeral will take place in the
village of Shalazhi, five kilometers southwest of Gekhi Chu.
</P>
<P>
An indirect confirmation of Dudayev's death came from the
leader of the public and political movement Daimokhk, Shamil Beno,
who told Itar-Tass that the situation in the separatist camp "can
become uncontrollable unless the opposition (separatist) forces
make up their minds quick on the division of power."
</P>
<P>
If Yandarbiyev and the most influential among the field
commanders, Aslan Maskhadov, reach an accord promptly, they will
be able to prevent the armed formations from breaking up into
small groups, Beno said.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 51, has led the Chechen separatist movement since the
break-up of the Soviet Union. In the past 16 months, he led armed
resistance to the Russian forces in the local republic.

<HEADLINE> Report: Medicare Trust Fund Has Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Medicare trust fund that
pays hospital bills for the elderly and disabled lost 4.2 billion
dollars in the first half of the current fiscal year and the
losses are growing, the U.S. Treasury Department said.
</P>
<P>
Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund lost money last year
for the first time since 1972, but the loss for all of last year
was only 35.7 million dollars, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The data show the fund is in worse shape than administration
officials projected last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures, the fund spent 60.5 billion
dollars and took in 56.3 billion dollars from October 1995 to
March this year.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats have been arguing for months over how
best to ensure Medicare's solvency.
</P>
<P>
There is little chance the trust fund will actually run out of
money. It contains more than 120 billion dollars, and Congress
would almost surely act to rescue the program before it was
seriously threatened. But the new data provide fresh evidence that
Medicare remains a budget problem of immense and growing
proportions.
</P>
<P>
Chris Jennings, a special assistant to President Bill Clinton
for health policy, said the new numbers were not surprising.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "They indicate the need to move forward, balance
the budget and enact some changes in Medicare that will strengthen
the trust fund." "Republicans and Democrats should work together
to address the problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
Republicans proposed many changes in Medicare last year to help
control costs, but Clinton said those particular proposals would
hurt beneficiaries. Republicans may hesitate to put forward new
proposals after they were bloodied in that battle.
</P>
<P>
No such deal is in sight. In this election year, lawmakers and
Administration officials are wary of any action that might offend
elderly voters by restricting Medicare spending, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Western Resolution Against China on Human Rights Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The longstanding Western attempt
to pass a resolution on human rights against China was foiled
again on Tuesday at the 52nd session of the UN Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Supported by most of the developing countries, China succeeded
in blocking a vote on a draft resolution sponsored by the European
Union and supported by the United States. A no-action motion
tabled by China was adopted by the 53-member UN Human Rights
Commission by a vote of 27 to 20 with six abstentions.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth such failure by Western countries, led by the
United States, since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that in order to draw as many supporters
as possible, Western countries had tried to make their draft
resolution look mild during internal consultations.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the "significant transformation" and
"positive developments" China had undergone in reforming its
economy and legal system, the draft resolution also made
unwarranted charges against China on a number of issues, including
Tibet, the administration of justice and policy on religion, which
are all internal affairs of China.
</P>
<P>
In tabling the no-action motion, Chinese ambassador and head of
delegation Wu Jianmin said in a statement that the West-sponsored
draft resolution, actually politically-motivated, cannot change its
anti-China nature, no matter how nicely it is wrapped.
</P>
<P>
He said the West-sponsored resolution is directed against not
only China but also all other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that for six years the United States and some other
Western countries had repeatedly launched vehement attacks against
China, and had tried to put China in the position of defendant at
the UN Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
But it was in these six years that China had made unprecedented
progress in all fields, including that of human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for their ceaseless slander is simple: they don't
like the mode of development the Chinese people have chosen," Wu
said, adding that "what really interests that superpower (the
United States) is domination or hegemony rather the human rights
of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese people will keep to the road of
their own choice no matter how many more anti-China resolutions the
West will sponsor in the future.
</P>
<P>
Wu also urged the UN Commission on Human Rights to strengthen
cooperation and dialogue and abandon confrontation.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion on the West-sponsored draft resolution in
the Commission, many developing countries, in particular Asian
nations, expressed their strong support for China.
</P>
<P>
While hailing the tremendous achievements made by China in its
economic reforms as well as in promoting human rights, they also

of the Sudan as already requested by the Sudanese permanent

<HEADLINE> Botswana Leader Desires No Economic Dependence On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Regional economic
dependence on South Africa is both undersirable and
unsustainable, visiting Botswana President Ketumile Masire said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special sitting of South Africa's constitutional
assembly, Masire, who is Chairman of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), said SADC's ultimate goal is to
replace such dependence with a healthier relationship of
inter-dependence and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Masire arrived in South Africa earlier in the day for a
three-day visit to the country at the invitation of President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Masire said SADC had developed a concrete
programme of action which would continue to guide cooperation in
various economic, social and political sectors.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, Masire said Botswana is looking
forward to a renegotiated southern African customs union
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The one-sided 1969 agreement must be replaced by a balanced
regime, consistent with the ideals of the present. Subordinating
sovereign states and trading partners to the whims of one country
is no longer sustainable," said Masire.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Anti-China Resolution Foiled Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A draft resolution against China
on human rights sponsored by the European Union and supported by
the United States was vetoed at the 52nd session of the UN
Commission on Human Rights here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of a no-action motion tabled by China in blocking
a vote on the West-sponsored anti-China resolution once again
demonstrates that the practice of power politics by the West in
interfering in other countries' internal affairs by making use of
the human rights issue has become increasingly unpopular and
encountered mounting opposition from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth such failure of the West since 1990, following
increasing discontent among developing countries with the political
confrontation in the Commission created by the United States
and other Western nations.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War in 1990, developed nations have
obviously replaced the confrontation between East and West with
one between South and North in the Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has passed 58 country resolutions since 1992,
almost all of them against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the current session, more than 60 developing countries, 10
more than last year, have been attacked by the West during
discussions of human rights records in individual states.
</P>
<P>
The United States vowed to continue to hang the sword of
Damocles over the heads of these governments -- in a deliberate
move to intensify confrontation in the Commission.
</P>
<P>
Some Western nations have long appointed themselves to the role
of human rights "models" and "judges", examining human rights only
in the developing countries, without questioning their own records.
</P>
<P>
The double standards reveal the true purpose of these Western
countries, which is not to truly promote human rights worldwide,
but to engage in power politics and to interfere in other
countries' internal affairs under the human rights banner.
</P>
<P>
More and more representatives from developing countries
pointed out the fact that no country can claim to have
unimpeachable human rights records.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the improvement of the human rights situation
in a country is closely linked with its economic, social and
cultural development. It is also a country's internal affair
which needs no lecturing from others.
</P>
<P>
No country, no matter how rich or how highly developed its
economy, can justify imposing its own values, concept of human
rights, development model or social system upon others, they added.
</P>
<P>
They said that discussion and promotion of human rights should
be undertaken in line with the principles of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and on the basis of equality and
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of Tuesday's vote, contrary to the expectations of
the U.S. and certain other Western countries, is evidence that
power politics, confrontation and the imposition of Western values
upon others are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The West, in the draft resolution, are forced to recognize the
achievements China has made in its economic reform and development
and in the reform of its legal system in an attempt to gain more
support for their resolution. However they tried again to
discredit China with unwarranted charges.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Western move, devised to damage China's image, was
made more for political purposes than for the genuine promotion of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
It also serves their attempt to contain China, a major power in
the developing world and one of the world's most rapidly growing
economies.
</P>
<P>
China has made clear that it will by no means allow itself to
be pressured into accepting others' values or giving up its own
choice of social system and development model.
</P>
<P>
After repeated failures, the Western countries should see the
need to stop practicing confrontation and double standards over
human rights issues, which is being increasingly challenged by
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it is high time for them to change course.

<HEADLINE> Attempt to Interfere in China's Internal Affairs Foiled: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China said today the failure of
the West to pass an anti-China resolution on human rights shows
that it is against the popular will to use human rights to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs and pursue
hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
Such act of the West is bound to be opposed by the majority
members of the Human Rights Commission, said a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman while commenting on the adoption of a decision
at the 52nd session of the UN Commission of Human Rights not to
review and vote on the West-sponsored anti-China draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Chinese government's willingness to make
concerted efforts, under the guidance of the principles of the
U.N. Charter, with other members of the international community to
further promote and protect human rights on the basis of equality
and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "the Chinese government has all along
attached importance to human rights and made tireless efforts and
achieved world-renowned success in promoting and protecting the
human rights of the Chinese people in accordance with the purposes
of the UN Charter and the spirit of relevant international
instruments on human rights and in line with China's specific
conditions."
</P>
<P>
While promoting and protecting the rights to subsistence and
development of the Chinese people, the Chinese government has
persevered in improving democracy and the legal system, he said,
adding that as a result, legal protection of citizen's rights in
the political, economic, cultural and social fields has been
markedly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
While China currently enjoys economic growth, political
stability, national unity and social progress, said the spokesman,
the Chinese people are exercising their human rights in an
increasingly fuller scope.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, some Western countries choose to ignore these
facts and raised once again the anti-China proposal at the current
session through politicizing the human rights issue and adopting
double standard in an attempt to put pressure on China by
exploiting the human rights issue so as to force the Chinese
people to alter the road they have chosen by themselves," he said.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Terrorist Attacks in Kosmet, Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and
another five injured on Monday night in several terrorist armed
attacks in Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija (kosmet),
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Information Service of the Interior Ministry of the
Yugoslav Republic of Serbia announced today that the organized
attacks on citizens and police in Kosmet were performed on Monday
between 20:25 and 21:30 local time.
</P>
<P>
Investigation was under way by the Serbian Interior Ministry to
identify and find the attackers, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said unidentified attackers opened
fire at 20:00 Monday at policemen who were on duty in Pec, a city
in Kosmet. Both were seriously wounded in arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, around 10 people in the Serbian
restaurant in the townlet of Decani were machine-gunned by
unidentified attackers.
</P>
<P>
On the Rozaje-Pristina road near Sremska Mitrovica, a police
patrol car was attacked. One woman and one policeman were wounded
seriously.
</P>
<P>
In the village of Stimlje, an unidentified attacker gunned down
a policeman.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians in Kosmet make up more than 90 percent of
the nearly two million local population. They have formed their
own institutions and Albanian-language schools and universities
hoping to secede from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of the Provincial Committee
of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia issued a statement today
condemning the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The latest armed attacks in Kosmet Monday night show that
Albanian separatist movement has opted for terrorism, which might
prevent a peaceful settlement of the existing problems in Serbia's
southern province," it said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Again Protests Suspension From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has again protested its
suspension from the Commonwealth, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter, dated April 21, to the Secretary-general of the
Commonwealth Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Nigeria's Foreign Minister
Chief Tom Ikimi said that lifting the suspension was necessary so
that the obstacle to dialogue between Nigeria and the
organization could be removed.
</P>
<P>
"However, the impression given to date is one of unfairness
and haste in treating a matter so vital to our country's national
interest and relations with the Commonwealth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria urges the leadership of the Commonwealth to "treat
urgently and seriously the fundamental issues raised in our
several petitions on this matter," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth during the
organization's meeting in Auckland last year in protest against
the execution of Ken Saro-wiwa and eight other Ogoni men.
</P>
<P>
The letter was written on the eve of a meeting of the
eight-member special Commonwealth ministerial committee to decide
on whether or not further sanctions would be imposed on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by the Zimbabwean Foreign Minister, Dr.
Stan Madenge, was set up shortly after the suspension to
investigate alleged gross human rights violations and monitor the
nigerian government's commitment to democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The committee has asked for a visit to Nigeria but has been
rebuffed by the Nigerian government.

HELSINKI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has no plans to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and will not be
responsible for the security of its Baltic neighbors, Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson was quoted as saying in a local
newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Helsinky Sanomat on the eve of his
visit to Finland, Persson said that the time was not right for
Sweden to join the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to its geographic location, Sweden has adopted
a policy of nonalignment and military neutrality, which are the
best guarantees of the country's interests, long-term security and
the stability of the Scandinavian peninsula as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Persson said that the Baltic countries have the right to choose
their own defense policies and Sweden will not be responsible for
their security.
</P>
<P>
Sweden fully supports the accession by other Baltic nations to
the European Union and respects their efforts to gain NATO
membership, he added.
</P>

The prime minister begins his working visit to Finland on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> OAS Demands Respect for Paraguay's Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States has expressed its "full and resolute" support for
Paraguay's President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in his confrontation with
the country's rebellious army commander.
</P>
<P>
The OAS Permanent Council called a special session Tuesday amid
reports that army commander General Lino Oviedo defied a
presidential order to step down from office. The standoff
generated fear of a military coup against the government.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at the council meeting, the OAS called
for a meeting of the Western Hemisphere's foreign ministers at a
date and place to be determined according to the developments in
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, while urging the
OAS to "speak up forthrightly and take action" in support of the
Paraguayan government, informed the organization that Washington
had suspended all military assistance to the South American
country effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Clinton administration was prepared to move
promptly in concert with other OAS members to impose economic
sanctions should an "extraconstitutional" regime take power in
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
"Such an interruption would also lead us to end all bilateral
economic cooperation and work to ensure any undemocratic regime
would be isolated internationally," he warned.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman said that President Clinton in a
telephone call Tuesday reiterated U.S. support for Paraguayan
President Carlos Wasmosy's efforts to maintain constitutional rule
in the country.
</P>
<P>
There were unconfirmed reports late Tuesday evening that
General Lino Oviedo had abandoned his rebellion against Wasmosy by
accepting retirement from the armed forces to become the country's
defense minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prepared Against Terrorism During Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal authorities
are stepping up activities to get prepared against possible
terrorist attacks during the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York and last
year's bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building have provoked
heightened concern about the possibility of some kind of terrorist
attack at the Olympics, The Washington Post said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist use of poison gas in the Tokyo subway system last
year has sown unprecedented anxiety about threats from
unconventional weapons, it added.
</P>
<P>
During the 17-day event, the Atlanta city's population will be
doubled and about 40 heads of state are expected to come that
requires security protection.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a task force under Vice President Al Core has been
set up to deal with possible terrorist attack. And a large
security force are being formed for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The force, more than doubling the 12,000 law enforcement
officers that protected the 1984 Olympics in Los Angles, will
consists of 3,000 Army troops, 6,300 National Guardsmen, and
10,000 other police and private security guards, with an
additional force of agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, the Post revealed.
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the worst, the FBI and other agencies are
holding secret exercises against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a three-day exercise were held in Atlanta against
terrorist nerve gas attack in the city and a plane hijacking at
the Atlanta airport.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Defense Nuclear Agency organized an exercise to
test its ability of dealing with a terrorist detonation of a
nuclear device near the city's center and another drill was
planned to deal with a germ-weapon attack.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal authorities will establish two
"explosive centers", where conventional bombs can be detonated or
defused.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these efforts has not been calculated, but the
Pentagon budget for supporting the Games is at least 47 million
dollars and an additional 25 million dollars has been committed
by the Georgia State on security, the paper noted.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Gives Tacit Approval to Appointment of New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
decided not to give a negative reply to the appointment of
U.N. Secretary-General's new envoy for Cyprus, but will give its
tacit approval.
</P>
<P>
This was stated today by government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that "we will accept the appointment under
protest. A negative reply would create a fresh negative reply
from Turkey and this would mean a vacant post."
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali contacted President Glafcos Clerides last week to
propose appointment of South Korean diplomat Han Sung Joo as new
U.N. envoy for Cyprus to replace Canada's former Prime Minister
Joe Clark.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was accepted by Turkey, which has rejected the
appointment of an European to the post, namely Portugal's former
Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government had indicated it would favor the
appointment of an European to the post.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said the government does not intend to reply to
the U.N. Secretary-General on the appointment of South Korean
diplomat Han Sung Joo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we have absolutely no problem with the
person appointed. Neither his country of origin nor the continent
he originates from cause any problem."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, pointed out that it considers the
Turkish position on the appointment of a U.N. Cyprus envoy
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Han Sung Joo, 55, foreign minister of Republic of Korea in
1993-94, is currently professor of political science and
President of the Ilmin International Relations Institute at Korea
University.
</P>
<P>
The new envoy is expected to succeed Joe Clark, who had failed
to bring the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides closer to a
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Japan Should Be Good Neighbor to S. Korea: Kim Young-sam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea should
develop forward-looking, good-neighborly relations based on a
correct perception of history, South Korean President Kim
Young-sam told a visiting Japanese delegation today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of representatives from Japan's ruling coalition,
led by Taku Yamazaki, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's
Policy Affairs Research Council, arrived here yesterday for a
three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"If Japan wishes to play a significant role as a member of the
international community, it should first maintain good-neighborly
relations with its neighbor, South Korea," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tokyo, in trying to improve relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), should first
exchange opinions with Seoul on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that at his meeting with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Bangkok in March, Hashimoto had
pledged that talks to normalize Japan-DPRK relations would not
advance ahead of any progress in inter-Korean relations.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki said Japan would try to forge forward-looking
relations with South Korea by interpreting history correctly and
retrospecting the past.
</P>
<P>
Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 until Japan's defeat in
World War II in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Fire Delays New York Subway Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The aging subway of New York ran
into chaos again Tuesday night when its southern section was put
under a small fire sparked by short-circuited electrical wires.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 trains carrying about 40,000 commuters were
affected at the busy intersection in Brooklyn, it was reported
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The short circuit blew three manholes into the air and started
a small fire. Much of the subway service between the boroughs of
Brooklyn and urban center of Manhattan was closed after the fire,
but it was restored by this morning's rush hour, local authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Three people suffered minor injuries in the fire and nine
trains had to be evacuated, city officials said. About 2,000
people were on each train.
</P>
<P>
Police said that after the manhole covers blew, someone called
from a pay phone to "claim credit" for the explosion. The caller

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Michael
Howard granted a month-long national firearms amnesty today after
the mass killing in a primary school in Dunblane, central
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Britain was alarmed on March 13 when a gunman armed with four
semi-automatic pistols burst in the school gym and opened fire at
29 children aged four to six. Sixteen pupils and one woman teacher
were killed and another 12 children wounded. Police estimated that
more than 2 million guns are held illegally.
</P>
<P>
Howard announced that the amnesty will last from June 3 to June
30 throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and the amnesty will
allow for illegally-held guns to be handed in to the police
without fear of prosecution, provided they have not been used in
crime.
</P>
<P>
And the amnesty also applied to ammunitions and grenades.
</P>
<P>
The British government has issued about 800,000 firearms
certificates, which must be renewed annually, but police estimated
that there are about 3 million guns in circulation across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary urged people to search their houses for any
old and unwanted guns and hand them in to the police.

<HEADLINE> Dudayev's Death Confirmed: Interfax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A top officer at the Russian
troops' command in Chechnya today confirmed reports about the
death of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Interfax on Tuesday quoted a number of persons close to the top
Chechen separatist as saying that Dudayev "is alive and working as
usual."
</P>
<P>
In a report today, the news agency cited the top officer at
the Russian troops' command in Chechnya as saying: "After
additional checks run by special forces, including those through
our network of agents, the information on Dudayev's death has been
confirmed."
</P>
<P>
Dudayev was mortally wounded after a Russian rocket attack hit
a separatist meeting near Gekhi-Chu village and soon died
there, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
In Chechnya, a top separatist leader, Shamil Basayev, and other
field commanders loyal to Dudayev have confirmed the death of
Dudayev, according to both Interfax and Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 51, a retired Soviet air force general, was elected
president of Chechnya in 1991. Since then he had led the local
republic in trying to break away from Russia.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Moscow backed opposition forces in the republic,
providing them with tanks and fighters for a coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
The coup attempt failed, and in December 1994 the Kremlin sent
40,000 troops into Chechnya to "restore constitutional order."
</P>
<P>
The 16-month-old war in chechnya has left some 30,000 civilians
dead, according to official estimates.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Benefitting Foreign Financial Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The 127 foreign banks and
financial firms now operating in China saw profits growing 50.5
percent to 140 million US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Assets jumped 61 percent to 19.14 billion US dollars, and loans
rose 68 percent to 12.74 billion US dollars, according to
statistics released by the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"The huge market and fast-growing economy in China have
provided various opportunities and great benefits to those foreign
financial institutions," said an official with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Foreign insurance companies, in particular, have shown
impressive gains.
</P>
<P>
Premiums for insurance other than life insurance in the two
foreign underwriters in Shanghai increased to 64 million yuan, and
life insurance premiums at American International Assurance
Co. Ltd (AIA), an affiliate of the American International Group,
stood at almost 400 million yuan, or 23 percent of Shanghai's
total.
</P>
<P>
"Those financial institutions have grown smoothly not only
because of their management and technology but because of the
flexible regulations and preferential tax policies provided by
China's financial authorities," the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China has a 15-percent income tax on foreign financial
institutions, while their Chinese counterparts have to pay from 33
to 55 percent in income tax.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason is that China is hungry for funds, and domestic
interest rates are much higher than international markets, leaving
a greater profit margin for those foreign financial institutions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them started to show a profit only a year or two after
they began operations in China."

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Haidar Abdul Shafi, Ziad Abu
Amr, Hanan Ashrawi and Rawya Shawwa -- members of the Palestine
National Council (PNC) and Palestinian Council -- issued an open
letter to the PNC today, setting conditions for any change of the
national charter.
</P>
<P>
The open letter said they could understand the important
reasons calling for amending the charter from purely Palestinian
perspective, for the charter will become more reflective of the
changing Palestinian situation.
</P>
<P>
However, the letter said, "this seems as if we are responding
to Israeli blackmail and dictation and not as a serious price for
the peace process which is based on respect to mutual commitments."
</P>
<P>
"At a time when Israel demands the Palestinian side to
implement specific commitments we find it disregarding its
commitments and the provisions of the agreement signed with it,"
it said.

<P>
Meanwhile, the letter noted, Israel conditions the
implementation of the Palestinian commitments with very cruel
demands and conducts unilateral measures which are creating facts
on the ground which are prejudicing the final-status results.
</P>
<P>
The letter said, "From this vantage point we see that Israel
is required in return for amending the Palestinian charter to
start first by carrying out the following:
</P>
<P>
"1. Accede to the Palestinian people right of self-
determination and establishment of a Palestinian state on its
national soil.
</P>
<P>
"2. The immediate implementation of what is left of Israeli
commitments of the transitional phase which includes the releasing
of Palestinian political prisoners, the opening of a safe
passage and the solution to the Palestinian refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
"3. To stop settlement activities, the confiscation of
Palestinian land and the construction of bypass roads.
</P>
<P>
"4. The commitment to redeploy Israeli forces in the Hebron
area immediately.
</P>
<P>
"5. To lift the Israeli closure imposed on the Palestinian
land and to allow free and unobstructed movement of individuals
and goods.
</P>
<P>
"6. To stop immediately all the Israeli measures that aim at
strengthening the illegal annexation of Jerusalem and its
isolation from the rest of the Palestinian land."

<HEADLINE> Welcoming Ceremony for Russian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
presided over a grand ceremony welcoming his Russian counterpart
Boris Yeltsin, at a plaza beside the Tiananmen Square here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
The red carpet was rolled out for the Russian president and his
wife at 6:00 p.m., when they stepped out of their limousines and
were greeted by Jiang. Flowers were presented by two young
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
As the two countries' national anthems were played and a 21-gun
salute reverberated across the plaza's vast expanse, Yeltsin
reviewed an honor guard made up of the three forces of the PLA, in
the company of Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents then held a brief discussion in the Great
Hall of the People, where Jiang extended a warm welcome to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"It's a warm spring in Beijing, which is full of flowers in
bloom and is overflowing with vigor," Jiang said. "The weather is
incredibly beautiful for your arrival -- a good omen for further
advancement of Sino-Russian relations," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
"We have met many times and can be called 'old friends'," he
went on to say, "I feel very happy about our reunion today."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Russian president's visit is very
significant and that he is looking forward to the official talks
with him tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he was very glad to come to China again and
talk with Chinese friends. "We attached great importance to this
visit and did a lot of preparatory work," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that this visit will prove a complete
success, and regrets that his stay in China during his last visit
was short. Yeltsin said he hoped that his next visit to China
will be a bit longer so that he can visit more places.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin presented two books to his Chinese counterpart. One,
"Reform, Development and Stability," is a collection of Jiang's 28
speeches and reports from September 1989 to September 1995 in
Russian. The other, also in Russian, "My Father Deng Xiaoping,"
is by Deng's daughter Xiao Rong.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of the
Russian president and his wife.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Trade with Other Balkan Countries Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Bulgaria and other
Balkan countries reached 2 billion U.S. dollars last year, a top
Bulgarian business leader said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted Bozhidar Bozhinov, chairman of the
Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as saying that of the
two billion dollar turnover, 1.4 billion dollars came from
Bulgaria's exports to the Balkan countries which made up 30
percent of the country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria had a trade surplus with all its Balkan neighbors, he
said at a round-table conference on Balkan trade liberalization
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the value of trade in goods with Bulgaria, Greece
topped other Balkan countries with 620 million dollars, followed
by Macedonia, Turkey, Romania and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria also hoped to increase its trade with Yugoslavia,
which accounted for 30 percent of Bulgaria's trade with all the
Balkan countries before the imposition of economic sanctions
against it, Bozhinov said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the chamber would urge the government to negotiate
agreements on investment protection and avoidance of duel taxation
with its Balkan neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But tax evasion by Balkan companies in Bulgaria was still a
problem, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign insurers have found themselves at a great advantage in
China's young insurance market.
</P>
<P>
"A new insurance company hardly ever makes a profit in less
than eight to ten years after it is established," he said. "AIA,
however, seems likely to turn a profit in five years or less."
</P>
<P>
AIA is the first foreign insurance company to be licensed in
China. It opened in Shanghai three years ago.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to open the financial sector further, since
foreign financial institutions have brought management techniques
and funds, and China has become more deeply involved in the world
economy, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Last year China opened 11 cities to foreign banks. These
included Beijing; Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province; Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province;
and Chengdu, capital of northwest China's Sichuan
Province. Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
was opened to foreign insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, foreign bank branches will be allowed to open
sub-branches in economic and technological development zones in
Dalian and Tianjin, two port cities in northeast and north China,
and in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
A few more foreign insurance companies will also be licensed
for China's insurance market.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cancels Demonstrations in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced its decision here
today that Iranian pilgrims would not stage political
demonstrations during their pilgrimage to Mecca in a bid not to
clash with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the decision on
canceling the political demonstrations against the United States
and Israel during haj rituals in Saudi Arabia was made by Iranian
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Iran declared early this month that Iranian pilgrims would
stage demonstrations during haj rituals in Saudi Arabia as "a
divine obligation."
</P>
<P>
However, the demonstrations by Iranians were strongly opposed
by the Saudi Arabian authorities, warning that those pilgrims who
want to stage demonstrations should be responsible for any kind of
consequences.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, 78,000 Iranian pilgrims would go to Mecca
and Medina this year.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government banned all political activities during the
pilgrimage. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979, Iranian
pilgrims insisted on staging political demonstrations and rallies,
saying that the pilgrimage should be used for political aims.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrimage every year reminds people of the bloody Mecca
incident on July 31, 1987, which led to thousands of deaths and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Some 320 Iranians were killed in the incident when thousands of
Iranian pilgrims clashed with Saudi police in a political
demonstration near the grand mosque in the holy city of Mecca.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Session Resolves to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd annual session of the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) today called for a "holistic approach" to the
problem of poverty, acknowledging that the problem is
inter-connected.
</P>
<P>
In a report adopted today, the session urged that increased
access to social services, health and education should go hand in
hand with income-generating schemes to boost the opportunities of
poor people.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP calls on its secretariat to formulate a regional
strategy and a program of action on rural poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The three-day annual ministerial session ended here today after
adopting a report containing a total of 11 resolutions ranging
from enhancing intra-Asia and Asia-Europe land bridges to
promoting human resources development among youth.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 47 ESCAP members and associate members agreed
that action is urgently needed to alleviate the region's growing
poverty problem while promoting sustainable development and making
sure that the environment is protected.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Asian-Pacific ministers spelled out different
ways of achieving such objectives, including regional economic
cooperation, poverty alleviation, environment and sustainable
development, transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
The session also urged increased technical assistance to the
poor countries in the region, especially the least developed,
land-locked and island developing countries. A slowdown of
official development assistance and other factors have made life
very difficult for the 13 least developed countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Most delegations to the session, while expressing support for
the work of ESCAP, urged the oldest intergovernmental body in the
region to continue its reforms, to do more and meet less.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also announced that the next year's session will be
held in Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Bid to Save Endangered Crane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUNNAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are conducting
a research programme to protect the Grus Nigricollis, one of the
most endangered cranes, from extinction. The birds live in the
southwest China's Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.
</P>
<P>
The migratory bird is listed with the Giant Panda as one of
China's first category protected animals. According to a survey
only 5,000 in total are in existence.
</P>
<P>
To save the precious species, the Nature and Culture
Conservation Center, based in Yunnan province, has launched a
special ecological and education research programme on the
endangered bird.
</P>
<P>
The center, co-sponsored by the (Hong Kong) China Exploration
and Research Society and the Yunnan Institute of Geography, sent
researchers to make on-the-spot investigations about the bird,
finding out the bird's basic living ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found that the northern-most breeding place for the
bird is located at about 39 degree north latitude and 3,185 meters
above sea level, and the southern-most living place for the bird
is situated at about 25 degree north latitude and with an
elevation of 3,200 meters.
</P>
<P>
To enhance people's animal protection awareness, they wrote and
distributed publicity material, and organized students to make
on-the-spot investigations on the bird.
</P>
<P>
" We should make the youth conscious of animal protection
before they become poachers," said Zhang Fan, director of the
center.
</P>
<P>
Although the the size of the swamp, the natural habitat of the
rare bird, is decreasing, its number is increasing on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
"The bird will not disappear with the swamp, it can live
happily in the same habitat as people, if they enhance their
awareness of wild animal protections," said Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Promotes Sichuan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Three
Gorges Project, the world's largest water-control scheme, has
brought new opportunities for the development of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years a number of large enterprises
involved in the chemical, electro-mechanical, building materials,
light and textile industries, have sprung up on the periphery of
the project's reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reservoir area is located in Sichuan. Thus far,
other parts of the country have poured more than three billion
yuan (about 360 million US dollars) into this area as part of the
efforts to support the construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country has implemented 286 new projects for the
area, donated equipment worth 40 million yuan, given technical
training to 8,800 people and helped resettle 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The province has grasped this opportunity to promote its
economy, and has issued favorable policies to create more business
opportunities. Various local governments are wooing large
enterprises in particular.
</P>
<P>
Wanxian City, for example, has given the green light to
enterprises from Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, by
setting up the "Shanghai Industrial Park."
</P>
<P>
Fuling City has allowed nine unprofitable enterprises to be
taken over by the Zhejiang Province-based Jinshan Group and
Fangyuan Group. As a result, a new company with a total investment
of 40 million yuan has been established in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Fuling Cigarette Factory, which lost 12 million yuan
annually in the past, has turned profitable since the Yunnan
Cigarette Factory readjusted its structure of products. The Fuling
factory is now one of the most profitable firms in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jinhua, deputy mayor of Wanxian City, said that after
cooperating with three enterprises -- Shanghai's Baimao Group,
Jiangsu's Changzhou Diesel Engine Co. Ltd and Shandong's Huasheng
Group, local enterprises have found "huge" market potential for
their products.

COLOMBO, April 24 (Xinhua)-- Security has been tightened in Sri
Lanka's hill country to meet any Tamil rebel threats during the
ongoing plantation workers' strike, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan plantation workers' strike, which commenced Monday,
enters its third day without a settlement in sight.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) fighting for a separate Tamil state in the north-east of
the country are likely to use the strike to launch attacks in
plantation areas.
</P>
<P>
However, stiff instructions have been given to all the police
officials in the plantation areas as to how to deal with any
incidents, the reports stated.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that special conferences for the police have
been held in all the divisions in the hill country and all police
stations are located in the vicinity of plantations. Patrolling is

<HEADLINE> UN Program Welcomes Chinese Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese volunteers are welcome to
work with the United Nations and apply their special skills and
knowledge to improving the lives of people of other developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
This message came from Susie Jolly, an official with the
Beijing office of the UNDP, who was interviewed by Xinhua here
today.
</P>
<P>
Jolly said that since 1981, when the UN Volunteers signed an
agreement with the Chinese government, more than 120 Chinese have
volunteered to work in over 20 developing countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin-america.
</P>
<P>
This included areas of traditional Chinese expertise in biogas,
agricultural technology, silk-worm production, irrigation, and
civil engineering. In the last few years, the areas have expanded
to optical instruments, computers, and medicine, she said.
</P>
<P>
"They generally work for one or two years abroad, with the
longest being eight years," said Jolly, adding that many Chinese
volunteers have won praise from governments of countries they've
helped.
</P>
<P>
"In many developing countries, stories of Chinese volunteers
are well-known," she said, "such as stories about the
acupuncturist in Western Samoa, the silk-worm specialist in
Pakistan and the optometrists in Syria."
</P>
<P>
She said that, to be eligible for service with UNV, Chinese
citizens should have a good command of either English or French,
at least a bachelor's degree, and more than two years of work
experience.
</P>
<P>
"However, not everybody who signs up for the project can go,"
she explained, "they have to compete with volunteers from other
countries."
</P>
<P>
"The demand for their specializations also affect their chances
of success."
</P>
<P>
Jolly, who can speak Chinese, said that she herself benefitted
from one year of service as a UN volunteer, and that "it is more
useful than going to university."
</P>
<P>
"It is a good opportunity to learn about the operations of the
United Nations and the national condition of China," she said,
adding that she hopes more Chinese citizens will take part in this
grand cause.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that while China has sent its own people
to help other nations, more than 160 volunteers from the U.S.,
Britain, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, and
other countries have worked in China over the past 16
years.

<HEADLINE> Comet Split Reported by Chinese Astronomers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The first report of a splitting
of the nucleus of the Hyakutake Comet has come from the Purple
Mountain Observatory in Nanjing, in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the observatory and its Qingdao affiliate in
Shandong Province made the announcement, based on observations on
April 6, 11, and 13, that the nucleus of the Hyakutake Comet had
split into five pieces, and the position and shape of the pieces
were changing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Daohan, an astrophysicist at Purple Mountain,
there are many explanations for comets splitting. In the case of
Hyakutake it is most likely that it was caused by solar influences.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that when the observatory first spotted the
splitting on April 6, the comet was only 0.78 astronomical units
(about 117 million km) from the Sun. The distance will be down to
0.23 astronomical units (about 34.5 million km) when the comet
reaches its perihelion, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said that this phenomenon is one which is highly valuable
for science in its study of the evolution of comets.
</P>
<P>
Hyakutake Comet, which is six times brighter than Haley's
Comet, was named after an amateur Japanese astronomer, who
discovered it on January 30 of this year. It reached its perigee,
about 15 million km from the earth, on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Purple Mountain Observatory is a prominent center for planetary
and cometary research, and was the first to spot the returning
comet in March.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 cases of cometary nuclei splitting have been
reported since the Comet Biela split in 1846.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Plans More Sanctions Against Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is facing further
sanctions imposed by the Commonwealth of Nations which is at odds
with the West African state on democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Committee on Nigeria, in
its meeting in London on Tuesday, recommended that member states
freeze foreign assets owned by Nigeria's military leaders and ban
the country from all international sporting contests.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had been suspended from the 52-member Commonwealth
last November following the military government's execution of
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight ethnic activists.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth had also imposed limited sanctions on the
West African state ruled by the military, including an arms
embargo and boycott of foreign tours by its military leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, a more severe economic sanction, such as an oil
embargo, was rejected by the Commonwealth committee, set up last
November to report human rights situation in the Africa's largest
producer of crude oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the committee held that an oil embargo will hurt
ordinary Nigerians more than their military leaders as over 80
percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income comes from the oil
revenue.
</P>
<P>
"To impose further economic measures, we will also need wider
consultations with the United States and the European Union,"
said a statement issued by the committee which is made up of
Canada, Malaysia, Britain, South Africa, Jamaica, New Zealand,
Ghana and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the Commonwealth "would not go beyond its
present recommendation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi on Tuesday
delivered a protest to the Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka
Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that lifting the suspension was necessary so
that obstacles to dialogue between Nigeria and the Commonwealth
could be removed.

<HEADLINE> China Chooses 12 Olympic Torch-Relay Bearers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has chosen 12 representives
to join 500-strong torchbearers from more than 100 countries and
regions for the Olympic torch relay across the United States, it
was announced by the Chinese Olympic Committee here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12, three children from poverty families were picked
up. They were aged from 15 to 18 from the national Hope Project
whose aim is to assist poor children back to school education. The
project is a non-profit programme providing education for 1.25
million children in more than 2,000 schools in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Rang Ying, 16, a Tibetan girl who re-started her schooling due
to the help of the project five years ago, said it was a dream for
her.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dream too sweet for me to believe. I thank for the
Coca Cola Company. I will tell my mother as soon as I find a
telephone," the girl said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jianping, a policeman from Tianjing, was chosen after
telling a story. The distance-running lover, who ran the second
fastest time among the local candidates, said he once had to run
10 kilometers to catch a thief, who happenly turned to be a
professional distance runner.
</P>
<P>
The 12 people were chosen from 25,000 candidates from China's
30 provinces. According to Coca-Cola, the sponsor of the torch
relay, the Chinese representives will carry the flame at New York
State's Niagara Falls on June 12.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame will arrive in the United States on April 27
and it will travel 15,000 miles in 84 days across the country.

<HEADLINE> Social Service Playing Key Role in Rural Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Wang Xiangqi was as
restless as ants on a hot pan when the cold wet weather stopped
him from sowing his rice seeds.
</P>
<P>
But a team of agronomists came to the rescue, and now the
farmer from Huanghua Town, Hunan Province, feels relieved.
</P>
<P>
The problem cropped up in the traditional spring sowing season
but Wang and other farmers could hardly sow the rice seed into the
field because of the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
"It was at this time when the agronomists came from door to
door to tell us a few days delay would not affect the sowing of
the improved seeds," Wang noted. "They always come at the right
time when we are in trouble," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang who has a family of three, has contracted a 0.46-hectare
paddy field, 0.4-hectare orange and tangerine orchard, and a fish
pond and opens a rice-processing mill. He sold 23 pigs last year
and earned a total income of 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed his success to the help of the Huanghua town
agrotechnique station, which has selected more than 200 rural
households to pilot scientific farming.
</P>
<P>
The town, which has almost 20,000 households and 5,615 hectares
of farmland, has 30 technical stations offering such services as
farm techniques, machinery, power supply, animal husbandry and
forestry.
</P>
<P>
These stations provided farmers with 170,000 kilograms of
improved seeds and 1.2 million yuan worth of pesticides, chemical
fertilizers and small farm machine tools last year.
</P>
<P>
Peng Shuangying, an agronomist and head of the town
agro-technical station, said farmers are realistic, and they
followed suit after seeing the good results achieved by farmers
piloting the scientific farming.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng, every village has an agrotechnician who is
in charge of helping farmers to learn new farming skills.
</P>
<P>
With the spread of new fish-breeding techniques, many farmers
have raised fish output from 300 kilograms per hectare to 4,500
kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Hunan is a traditional agricultural producer in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has built a number of services
involving scientific popularization, distribution of farm
products, market information, production and supply of improved
seeds, crop protection, farm machinery supply and maintenance and
rural education and technical training.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of scientists have gone to rural areas to
contract for farming, and 20,000 technicians are offering
on-the-spot services to help farmers repair farm machinery.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that work on 2.04 million hectares of farmland,
or 40 percent of the total cultivated land, is done by machinery
thus freeing about one half of the rural labor forces.
</P>
<P>
Many places have organized tractor drivers to form cooperatives
to contract for field work.

<HEADLINE> Less Surplus Expected In China's 1996 Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade surplus is
expected to be narrowed dramatically this year.
</P>
<P>
Increase in exports may drop drastically as China reduced
export rebate rates again in January this year, following the
first cut in July 1995, according to the 1996 China Financial
Outlook, which was released today by the People's Bank of China,
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Rising domestic demands and a relaxing of import restrictions,
among other factors, will boost imports, the Outlook said.
</P>
<P>
China is not expected to have such a foreign trade surplus as
in 1995 if exports slow down and imports go up, said the Outlook.
</P>
<P>
China had 16.69 billion US dollars in foreign trade surplus and
73.59 billion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the customs accord with the central
bank's prediction. Over the first quarter, China's exports dropped
8.7 percent, and import surged 23.2 percent, compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Outlook, however, emphasized that consecutive cuts in
export rebates will not thoroughly reverse the growing momentum in
exports, which has continued over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The state has not overhauled policies encouraging exports, and
to hold on original market shares, foreign trade firms will not
curtail exports, said the Outlook, though the reduction in export
rebate has squeezed their profits, weakening export motives.
</P>
<P>
Under the current foreign trade mechanism, expanding exports
are still a major way for enterprises to develop.
</P>
<P>
"So the growing momentum in China's foreign trade will not be
radically turned around," the Outlook added.

<P>
XINING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sebei gasfield in the eastern
part of northwest China's Qaidam Basin expects to develop an
annual gas production capacity of one billion cu m by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, gas reserves totalling 50 billion
cu m have been found in the eastern part of the Qaidam
Basin. Experts put the total amount of gas resources there at
around 700 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The local source said that construction has started to lay a
gas pipeline from the Sebei gasfield, with total investment of 300
million yuan. And gas will be supplied to Golmud City in Qinghai
Province, some 190 km away, for power development this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) has signed
cooperative agreements with the Amoco Orient Petroleum Company of
the United States to explore gas resources in a 10,000-sq km area
in the eastern part of the Basin.
</P>
<P>
The local source added that a breakthrough has also been made
in gas exploration in the northern part of the Qaidam Basin. A
high-yield gas well newly drilled here showed that this region has
a probable gas reserve of 7.7 billion cu m.

<HEADLINE> PNC Advances Deliberation On National Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Council has shifted the discussion on the National Charter from
Thursday to 6 p.m. today, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is currently presiding over a
meeting of the PLO Executive Committee to prepare for this
evening's session.
</P>
<P>
It is not known if the PNC will elect a new PLO Executive
Committee today as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The current 21st PNC session is dubbed as "Building and
Reconstructing the Homeland." Out of the council's 669 members,
536 were present at Tuesday's session. 530 members are attending
today's session.
</P>
<P>
The charter deliberations might end tonight, or continue
through tomorrow. At the end, the members will have to vote on one
of several ideas. Two-thirds majority is set at 446 members,
according to PNC Speaker Salim Zanoun.
</P>
<P>
There are four schools of thoughts on the matter:
</P>
<P>
First, to vote on canceling the articles that Israel wants
deleted. The PNC will appoint its Legal Committee to look into
alternatives to the original charter. The PNC would also approve
an interim political program that the PLO would implement until
the next session of the PNC. The alternatives to the charter
would be based on the peace accords, especially the letters of
mutual recognition of September 1993.
</P>
<P>
Second, to make any change or cancellation of the National
Charter conditional on Israeli acceptance of the principle of
Palestinian self-determination. The basic premise of this position
is that the Palestinians will not have anything left to
presure Israel with after the charter is changed, so they
should get something in return. When Abdul Shafi, who is the
most vocal proponent of the choice, outlined this idea in last
night's session, Arafat lashed out at him and Abdul Shafi
walked out of the session.
</P>
<P>
Third, to vote on replacing the National Charter with the
1988 PNC Declaration of Independence. The declaration accepted
U.N. Resolution 242, recognized Israel and called for a
two-state solution.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, to vote on refusing to change the charter. This
trend is expected to be voiced by Abdul Rahim Mallouh,
leader of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine (PFLP),
but is a very minority position.

<HEADLINE> Money Grows on Trees for Yellow River Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- They are proving that money grows
on trees in a once barren area along China's Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of hectares of barren hills along the
famous river in north China's Shanxi Province has been transformed
into a money-spinning corridor. The greening of the hills has
brought vincible interests for local people.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have planted more than 130,000 ha of trees on
the barren hills along the river, 60 percent of which are cash
trees helping peasants to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Lin County in Luliang Prefecture, Shanxi Province, has become
the biggest red date production base in the country. For three
consecutive years, annual output volume of red date in the county
surpassed 50 million kg, contributing 40 percent of the per
capita annual income of residents.
</P>
<P>
Fruit trees in the two townships of Huangtanping and Zaoling,
Xiangning County, have produced over 8.2 million yuan (some one
million U.S.dollars) of net income for the local economy, giving
an extra 376 yuan to the per capita annual income of local people.

MOGADISHU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people died and 33
others were wounded when a fierce fighting broke out in south of
the Somali Capital, Mogadishu, last night between militiamen of
Mohamed Farah Aideed and those of his rival, Osman Hassan Ali
Atto, according to hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness, the fighting broke out when the
militiamen loyal to Mohamed Aideed had launched an artillery and
mortar attack on positions of Osman Atto's men in Bosnia
vicinity, the area controlled by Osman Atto in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of the fighting, the armed men
exchanged anti-aircraft missiles, multiple rocked launchers,
and heavy and small machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The thunder and out-burst of the heavy shelling lit the dark
war torn capital with red flares flying over the roofs of the
residential areas throughout Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid, the man in charge of
Osman Atto's militiamen, his forces have destroyed three battle
wagons belonging to General Aideed, however, eyewitness confirmed
only one double barrel anti-aircraft missile launcher being
blazed as a result of improper rocket discharge. In general, no
party has made any territorial gain and the fighting seems to
have subsided this morning even though some sporadic shootings
are heard along the front lines dividing the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At least 120 people are believed to have died and nearly 400
others wounded since the armed confrontation started between
Aideed and Osman Atto last month in the southern port town of
Merca, 100 km south of Mogadishu. The clashes in Merca have
spread to the capital where the two sides are still engaged in
bitter clashes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Commercial Bank to Issue Mastercards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Commerical Bank (VCB)
is scheduled to issue 3,000 mastercards this year and a unlimited
number in coming years, a report here said today.
</P>
<P>
The issuing work will start officially from April 26. This is a
remarkable step in the development of the country's capital market
and is part of the strategy to widen the use of non-monetary forms
of payment, a VCB official said.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, VCB will issue mastercards only in Hanoi
and Ho Chi Minh city. The card will be issued nation-wide two or
three months later.
</P>
<P>
VCB Will issue two kinds of mastercards-- an ordinary card and
a gold card for high-income customers.
</P>
<P>
The cards will have minimum setting levels equivalent to 1,000
and 5,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The state-run bank expects to issue 40,000 mastercards by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, VCB has invested 5 billion vn dong
(roughly 450,000 U.S. dollars) in implementing the programme so
far.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the card does face some obstacles. The
Vietnamese people, used to small daily costs, are not familiar
with the use of credit cards and their income is still very
low.

<HEADLINE> ADB Adopts New Policies to Improve Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has adopted several new policies to consolidate its operational
thrusts in a bid to improve the quality of projects in its
developing member countries.
</P>
<P>
Among them, according to the latest issue of the ADB Review,
the policies on governance, inspection function and involuntary
resettlement are particularly significant.
</P>
<P>
The policy on governance marks an important step toward the
promotion of sound development management.
</P>
<P>
To make good governance operationally relevant, the bank will
emphasize accountability, participation, predictability and
transparency.
</P>
<P>
The inspection function establishes a formal grievance
procedure for the benefit of any community, organization or group,
which deems itself adversely affected by a public sector bank
project.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy on involuntary resettlement, all projects
approved by the bank after January 1, 1996, require an initial
social assessment to identify affected population.
</P>
<P>
Involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized and,
where feasible, be conceived and executed as part of the project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank also intends to make co-financing a
mainstream activity to catalyze additional private capital for
developing member countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank will assist co-financing in appraising and managing
risks. The guarantine facility will be used to enable developing
countries with limited access to capital markets to attract
long-term debt financing.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Not to Expand Free Trade Area to NZ, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will not expand its free trade area to the Common
Economic Region (CER) of New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today
that the economic ministers of the ASEAN will discuss the
ASEAN-CER ties when they meet late this week in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are not yet ready at this point in time," citing
that the ASEAN's hesitancy to forge formal free trade with the CER
at this point is largely due to the wide disparity in both
regions' level of economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the ASEAN is amenable to easing up
customs rules to facilitate trade between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Among the customs rules that the ASEAN is willing to relax for
the CER is on phytosanitary procedures.
</P>
<P>
He said that the harmonization of the phytosanitary procedures
will be reviewed by the ASEAN Secretariat.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- More than eight out of ten
disabled people in the north China port city of Tianjin have found
jobs.
</P>
<P>
It follows a major drive throughout the city to offer a better
deal for thousands of disabled people.
</P>
<P>
People almost blind with cataracts have had operations to
restore their sight, hundreds of deaf children have been given
special training and a network of special training centres for the
disabled have opened.
</P>
<P>
Now Tianjin has reported marked achievements in developing
welfare services for the disabled, as a result of scientific use
of welfare funds, said officials of the local welfare fund for the
disabled in an recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A working system of welfare funds for the handicapped has been
set up across the city. In 1995, the city raised more than 840,000
yuan in donations and materials for the disabled, with more than
260,000 yuan used in welfare services.
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's districts and counties have established
recovery centers for the handicapped. The city has completed over
8,300 operations on cataract patients, treated over 5,200 cases of
infantile paralysis, and conducted language training with 411 deaf
children.
</P>
<P>
The city has set up 33 schools for various disabled children,
with total number of handicapped students standing at over
8,200. Some 10,000 local handicapped people have attended
practical technical training.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin municipal government also issued regulations on
employing disabled people. More than 66,000, or 83 percent of all
the handicapped who are qualified under the regulations, have
found jobs. Of them, some 20,000 are working with the more than
1,500 welfare enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the municipal welfare fund, 3,003 out of the
5,000 especially poor households of the disabled are now having an
easy life.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin also established special funds to encourage handicapped
people to participate in scientific work, artistic creation and

<P>
YINCHUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Li Xuewen is a human calculator
- able to add and subtract in just seconds, and he is not yet five
years of age.
</P>
<P>
But his mother says that rapid calculating is nothing new for
her brainy son - he has been doing sums since the age of two.
</P>
<P>
The toddler from the Wudunzi Township of Xingxia Hui Autonomous
Region's Taole County is able to rapidly calculate in his head.
</P>
<P>
Just weeks away from his fifth birthday, Li Xuewen entered a
pre-school class in March this year. His teacher was so surprised
at his ability to do sums in his head, with numbers up to 10,000,
that Li was sent to study in a primary school.
</P>
<P>
Li was also special in the primary school. Asked to add 888
plus 888, he answered "1,776" within five seconds.
</P>
<P>
The same question was put to fourth year students of the
primary school, no one answered within 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Li's mother said that Li Xuewen was able to do sums quickly in head
even when was only two years old. He was even faster in accounting
than his elder brother who was a first year pupil of primary
school at that time.
</P>
<P>
Li is able to count at any time, any place and under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
His father said they have never taught Li Xuewen arithmetic
before. "But he is especially interested in accounting," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
flew into Beijing in high spirits on a fine spring afternoon,
starting a three-day state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
When one of three Russian Il-62 special planes carrying the
Yeltsins landed on the south runway of Capital Airport at 14:40
Beijing time, the Russian President and his wife Naina stepped
down the plane with beaming smiles.
</P>
<P>
At the foot of a red carpet, Yeltsin and his wife were greeted
by Li Boyong, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and China's Minister of Labor.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, whose hair was being stroked by a spring breeze,
received flowers from two young Chinese women and two Russian
children.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Yeltsin on his delayed China trip were First
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Davydov, Foreign Minister Evgeny Primakov, Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev and other senior Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
Also greeting the Russian head of state were Chinese
Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang and Chinese Ambassador to
Russia Li Fenglin.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, and escorted by 11 motorcycle outriders, the
motorcade carrying Yeltsin and his entourage drove to the downtown
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing where they will stay.
</P>
<P>
This is Yeltsin's second visit to China since 1992.
</P>
<P>
During the current visit Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Yeltsin are scheduled to hold talks on a wide range of issues
including bilateral relations and international issues of shared
concern.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are expected to sign a series of documents
governing bilateral cooperation and good-neighborly ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Yeltsin will later join the heads of state from
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in Shanghai to sign an
agreement on the build-up of confidence in the military field in
border areas.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the current visit by Yeltsin will push
Sino-Russian friendly relations and cooperation into a new era.

<HEADLINE> Manila Concerned Over Imports Outpacing Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
expressed concern that the growth in imports has outpaced exports
in February, the first time in many months.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista noted that
although exports are growing but the rate of increase is lower
than the growth in imports.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, total trade in
February increased by 37 percent to 3.951 billion US dollars over
2.876 billion dollars in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports went up by 45.9 percent in February to 2.357
billion dollars from 1.616 billion dollars in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, exports grew only by 26.5 percent to 1.594
billion dollars from 1.260 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in many months that the growth in
imports outpaced exports," he indicated.
</P>
<P>
However, he explained that it is just normal for a developing
economy like the Philippines to register increases in imports as
long as the growth would not outpace exports.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the trend could be corrected in
the succeeding months.
</P>
<P>
The government is targeting a 50 billion dollar export level by
the year 2000 to attain a newly industrializing country status
from the 21 billion dollar target this year.

<HEADLINE>   ASEAN Not to Expand Free Trade Area to NZ, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will not expand its free trade area to the Common
Economic Region (CER) of New Zealand and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today
that the economic ministers of the ASEAN will discuss the
ASEAN-CER ties when they meet late this week in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are not yet ready at this point in time," citing
that the ASEAN's hesitancy to forge formal free trade with the CER
at this point is largely due to the wide disparity in the two
regions' level of economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the ASEAN is amenable to easing up
customs rules to facilitate trade between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Among the customs rules that the ASEAN is willing to relax for
the CER is on phytosanitary procedures.
</P>
<P>
He said that the harmonization of the phytosanitary procedures
will be reviewed by the ASEAN Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Perry, Peres to Discuss Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry said Tuesday that he would discuss Israeli anti-missile
defenses with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres when the latter
comes to Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering in downtown Washington of the
Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish rights group, Perry said that he
and Peres will discuss theater missile defense and other weapons
systems the two countries are jointly developing to further
bolster Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Peres would visit Washington from
Sunday to Tuesday, during which he and Perry would sign a
memorandum on joint missile defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Israel are jointly developing systems
such as the Arrow anti-tactical missile system and high-energy
lasers that will be able to knock rockets and lasers out of the
air closer to their launcher point than previous systems," Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also looking at some new initiatives in the area
dealing with early warning. All of these programs we will discuss
very seriously and in a very substantive way with the prime
minister when he is here this weekend," he added.
</P>
<P>
Perry vowed once again that the United States would continue to
ensure Israel's military superiority in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I am the secretary of defense for the United
States, we will maintain the qualitative edge in Israel."
</P>
<P>
To attain that end, the United States provides Israel with 3
billion dollars a year in foreign aid, 1.8 billion dollars of it
for defense.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Re-Exports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The value of re-exports in
Dubai in 1995 decreased 22.7 percent from that of 1994, Gulf News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing Dubai Customs Department statistics, said
that Dubai re-exported goods -- mostly in the form of machinery,
electrical equipment and textiles -- worth 883 million
U.S. dollars in 1995, down from 1.143 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the fall to the reduction of Iran's
import from Dubai, since the largest market of Dubai has been
controlling the hard currency for saving in order to service its
estimated foreign debt of some 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iran faces rescheduled annual debt
repayments of some 5 billion dollars, nearly a third of total budgeted
oil export revenues of 15.99 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dudayev to Be Buried, Succeeded by Yandarbiyev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leader Azhokhar
Dudayev, who was reportedly killed in a rocket strike in the
village of Gekhi-Chu on Sunday night, is likely to be buried
today, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted "an informed source" in the Moscow-backed Chechen
government as saying that Dudayev may be buried near the grave of
his mother in the settlement of Salazhi, some 35 kilometers
southwest of the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The death of Dudayev was confirmed by well-known Chechen
terrorist leader Shamil Basayev, who declared on rebel television
yesterday that Dudayev's power had been transferred to the
vice-president of the rebel regime Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass cited the independent Chechen news agency as saying
that Basayev at first opposed the transfer of Dudayev's powers to
Yandarbiyev, but later agreed to have the vice-president rule
until the election of a new separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that Basayev and some other field
commanders opposed Yandarbiyev to be Dudayev's successor at a
joint session of the defense council and the government of the
separatists on Monday. However, it was finally decided to
transfer Dudayev's power to Yandarbiyev in accordance with the
existing separatist constitution.
</P>
<P>
The local news agency warned that "the death of Dzhokhar
Dudayev could throw Chechnya into a war of clans if field
commanders had preferred their chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov as
the new leader" instead of the 44-year-old Yandarbiyev, who was
appointed vice-president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of Dudayev's supporters challenged the reports
of Dudayev's death. The vice premier of the separatist government,
Khasan Kazuyev, who is based in Istanbul, told the Interfax news
agency that he had talked to Dudayev by satellite telephone on
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that
even if the death of Dudayev is officially confirmed, the
Kremlin's peace plan for Chechnya "will not change in any way,"
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was echoing Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
said in Khabarovsk in Russia's Far East this morning: "With or
without Dudayev we shall wind up everything in Chechnya in
peace. There will be no war."
</P>
<P>
The Russian premier is waiting for an official confirmation of
Dudayev's death, Itar-Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Good Neighbors, Friends Along Sino-Russian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An old Chinese saying goes that
"neighbors are dearer than distant relatives". This not only
expresses the common wish of people on both sides of the
Sino-Russian border, but is also a real depiction of the existing
friendly relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Last year, just before Christmas, frontier inspectors from both
sides saluted each other on a cross-border bridge and entered the
office of the director of the Russian frontier inspection station,
talking and laughing.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Li Huizhang and his colleagues from the
Dongning frontier inspection station went to express festive
greetings to their Russian counterparts stationed at the Tavka
frontier inspection station.
</P>
<P>
Director of the border post Aleksander Nikolaevich Banov said,
"Christmas is a festival that we celebrate together with our
relatives and friends. Today it is our Chinese friends and
relatives who are celebrating the festival with us."
</P>
<P>
During China's Spring Festival, Russian frontier guards are
invited to Chinese frontier inspection stations to attend festival
celebrations and watch videos on the rapid development of China's
construction and economy.
</P>
<P>
They said, "Of course, we are happy that the Chinese people
have become rich. Peace is the guarantee for national prosperity
and the happiness of all people."
</P>
<P>
There are increasing exchanges across the border between
businessmen, tourists, students going abroad, government
officials, fashion models, experts, scholars, workers, farmers,
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Once a Chinese customs inspector broke his right leg while
working on an inspection ship. The Russian side immediately rushed
to the rescue and sent him to the central hospital in Khabarovsk
by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Eight Russian frontier guards donated blood to the Chinese
inspector, who returned to Chinese frontier inspection station
safely later.
</P>
<P>
A Russian official said, "The development of the Far East area
of Russia needs help from China," noting, "of course, China's
modernization drive also needs help from Russia."
</P>
<P>
He added, "We depend on each other to achieve economic
development and the happiness of mankind."

battle it out in a competitive spirit on playing fields in towns
along the 4,300 kilometer border.
</P>
<P>
The sounds of tanks and troop carriers have been drowned out by
the musical notes of dance ensembles, and the dinner parties have
become place where high ranking officers from China and Russia
meet to share their experiences.
</P>
<P>
Contact between frontier troops of China and Russia have been
strengthened in recent times.
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchange of visits by border troops of both sides have
cemented a friendly relationship between the two great nations in
the world, said Shi Jianye, director of the Frontier Public
Security Bureau of Heilongjiang, which shares 70 percent of the
4,300-km-long boundary line with Russia, the longest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Shi just came back from a tour to Russia at the invitation of
the commander of the Russian Pacific Border District. During his
visit, Shi signed an agreement on maintaining the peace and
friendly relations on the Sino-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
In June 1990, leading officials of both sides reached a
consensus on increasing friendly visits by high-ranking officials
from each other.
</P>
<P>
Since then, exchange of visits by senior frontier army officers
have been on the rise. Border guards of both sides have invited
each other to attend festival celebrations, dinner parties or
cultural activities and sports games.
</P>
<P>
On May 28, 1995, the Russian soldiers invited their Chinese
counterparts to a military sports meeting to mark the frontier
army day. Soon afterwards, the Russian Far East and the Pacific
Border Districts sent song and dance ensembles to perform at
border cities of Suifenhe and Heihe.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced friendship brings peace and tranquility on the
Sino-Russian border and promotes bilateral trade and economic
development, said a Russian officer.
</P>
<P>
Chinese observers deem that the growing friendly ties between
border troops of China and Russia will not only help to maintain
peace and prosperity on the border areas but also be conducive to
the establishment of a partnership between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China, Nigeria to Strengthen Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu
Yi told visiting Nigeria Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi in Beijing
today that China is willing to have closer trade ties with
Nigeria, which has become China's third biggest trade partner in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China attaches much importance to its trade and
economic cooperation with Nigeria, and Chinese commodities are in
line with the demands of Nigerian markets. But despite this
bilateral trade volume covered only one percent of Nigeria's total
last year.
</P>
<P>
She said that China hopes it will export more to Nigeria while
increasing its imports from the African country, and China hopes
that Nigeria would import more of its farm machinery, complete
sets of equipment, and small-sized power generators.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairing the third session of Sino-Nigerian Joint Committee
on Trade and Economy today, Wu said that China's trade ties with
Nigeria have developed smoothly since the committee's previous
session 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Last year, trade volume between China and Nigeria reached 210
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is the foothold of China's foreign policy to strengthen and
develop its friendship and cooperation with developing countries,
Wu said, and China is willing to have closer cooperation with
Nigeria in the fields of agriculture, iron and steel, power,
development of water resources and harbor dredging.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties in
1971, China and Nigeria have enjoyed a sound relationship, and
they have made great achievements in the cooperation in the fields
of politics, economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest developing country and Nigeria is the
country with the biggest population in Africa, Wu said, and China
treasures the long-term and sincere friendship between the peoples
of the two countries, and is willing to promote the friendship on
the basis of equality, mutual benefits and peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said that his large delegation shows the desire of the
Nigerian government to expand its trade ties with China, and he
expects the current session will become a new start for bilateral
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both Nigeria and China implement policies of non-interference
in other's internal affairs, Ikimi said, and China's efforts in
supporting and safeguarding the rights and interests of developing
countries has left a great impression on the Nigerian people.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to encourage businesses to invest
in each other's country and create more favourable climate for
them.

<HEADLINE> HK Container Throughput Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Throughput at Hong Kong's
container terminals dropped for the first time in more than three
years, according to the latest official statistics for March.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Port Department Board (PDB) said that
throughput at the eight container terminals fell 5.7 percent in
March, the first month of negative growth since January 1993.
</P>
<P>
Growth in terminal traffic for the first quarter of 1996 also
slowed down to 1.7 percent, compared with a 10-percent increase
during the corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The drop in container throughput in March was partly due to the
decline of Chinese exports in the first three months of this
year, according to a PDB official.
</P>
<P>
The container terminal industry currently accounts for 20
percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Experts Cautious On China's Inflation Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, are cautiously optimistic that China's
inflation will stay on a downward track this year.
</P>
<P>
"A sound foundation" has been laid for further curbing of
inflation, they said in the 1996 China Financial Outlook, released
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More people from all walks of life have agreed that the
government is giving top priority to curbing inflation in
long-term economic control, and the government has taken
initiatives, instead of being forced, to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has adhered to the moderately tight monetary
policy. If it forces the growth rate of the supply of M2, currency
in circulation plus enterprises' deposits down to 25 percent,
prices will keep going down over the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
About 9.7 percent of the inflation in 1995 was due to price
hikes in the second half of the previous year, and the percentage
in this year will be reduced to around three percent, providing
large room to regulate prices.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture will remain a main inflation booster.
</P>
<P>
"A lean year and lack in agricultural product supply will push
up prices," warned the experts, and given other expected measures
to regulate prices, "it will be a very arduous job to control
inflation within the schedule range."
</P>
<P>
China plans for its gross national product to expand eight
percent, and the nationwide retail price index to surge ten
percent in 1996. It is making efforts to put the growth rate of
the supply of M2 at 25 percent, that of M1, currency plus all
kinds of deposits, at 18 percent, and that of M0, currency in
circulation, at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The economic growth rate will possibly be lower than in 1995
as the increase in money supply is expected to slow down," they
pointed out, "But the growth rate will not be much lower than in
1995", because the real increase in money supply will be close to
that in 1995, given the slowing down of inflation and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
The first annual China Financial Outlook was published in 1994,
including two main reports on macro economy and monetary policy,
and dozens of reports on reforms, development and opening-up in
the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The new Outlook released today has a special report
illustrating the reforms, goals, policies and measures to put
these goals into reality, and prospects, environment, challenges
facing the financial sector in the next five years.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China is aiming to develop more
medicines which are competitive in the world market, said Zheng
Xiaoyu, director of the State Pharmaceutical Administration today.
</P>
<P>
He told a national medical conference in Beijing today that new
medical products are expected to make up a quarter of the total
output of the Chinese medical industry by the year 2000, and 30
percent, in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The development of new medicines should focus on products
protected by intellectual property rights, and those that can be
used to cure or treat both common and complicated diseases, said
Zheng. He added that ten new medicines which will be the first of
their kinds both on the domestic and world markets are expected to
be developed in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
China will promote the introduction of foreign advanced science
and technology to the medical industry, and set up ten medical
enterprises and groups with a sales volume of over five billion
yuan each in next fifteen years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the export of preparations should be promoted, and
80 percent of the new products should meet world standards by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that Chinese medical enterprises should co-operate
with foreign companies which applied for administrative protection
from the Chinese government for their patent medicines, and
introduce more effective medicine and medicines of special use
from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, more than 40 kinds of foreign patent medicines have
obtained administrative protection from the Chinese government.

same. There will be no war there."
</P>
<P>
The president, in the Far East city of Khabarovsk on his way to
China, condemned Dudayev as an instigator of war.
</P>
<P>
"It was he (Dudayev) who wanted war, while we wanted peace. We
several times offered him to sit down at the negotiating table to
begin talks and end the conflict peacefully, but he did not
agree," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Moscow-backed Chechen government and the Russian
military have said the fact of Dudayev's death should be checked
out.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 52, declared Chechen independence in 1991. He had been
hiding in the mountains since Moscow sent Russian troops to the
Caucasian republic in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
On March 31 Yeltsin announced a halt to large-scale military
operations, a partial withdrawal of troops and an offer of
indirect talks with Dudayev.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Premier Sees Progress in Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has said that progress was taking place in the current
international diplomatic efforts to end a cease-fire in Lebanon,
but "an accomplishment would still need some time."
</P>
<P>
"The real picture is much better than the prevailing
impression," the prime minister told reporters in his office
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with French Ambassador to Lebanon, Jean-Pierre
Lafon, Hariri said he hoped that a solution would be reached in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the French Ambassador delivered to him a
message from French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette.
</P>
<P>
He said the French ambassador expressed his belief that current
diplomatic negotiations were progressing.
</P>
<P>
Lafon said there was a coordination between the Americans and
the French, noting that France had provided and was still
providing the major contribution which could be accepted by all
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a result will be achieved in the next few days,"
he quoted the French envoy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, along with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri,
returned home from Damascus Tuesday afternoon following two days
of talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Vice President
Abdel Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and French
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette.
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources said that the talks were focussed on
the recent proposals raised by France and the United States for a
cease-fire in Lebanon and the end of Israeli aggressions against
his country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wage Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The ease of inflationary
pressures in Australia was further confirmed today by figures
showing a slowdown of wage growth in the three months to February
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS), full-time adult ordinary time earnings increased
by only 0.4 percent in the February quarter.
</P>
<P>
And the annual wage growth rate in the year to February stood
at 3.7 percent, much lower than the highest safe limit of 4.5
percent annually, set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
</P>
<P>
Today's wage figures suggested that inflationary pressures have
eased. Statistics released by the ABS yesterday showed that the
inflation rate in the year to March dropped to 4.2 percent from
5.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Federal Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith said the wage
figures were consistent with low inflation.
</P>
<P>
"It's an encouragement, as to where we have been and therefore
where we might go in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former board member of the RBA Bob Gregory said, "If you look
at these numbers alone, they won't trigger an interest rate
increase, that would have to come from overseas or a number that
was bigger than this."
</P>
<P>
He said that the RBA would like to see wage claims even lower
although today's figures indicated inflation would come down
further.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said that although
the inflation rate was back to 4.2 percent before the Labor Party
lost office in the federal election in March, there was still
possibility that wages growth over the next year would exceed five
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lessened inflationary pressures were good news for the
Coalition Government, which is striving to reduce the budget
deficit, local press reports said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank's Assets Frozen In London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSDAKA, April 24 (Xinhua)-- Xome assets of the Bank of Zambia have
reportedly been frozen in London by a court ruling for failure to
clear a staggering 85 million pound debts accumulated in oil
procurement, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The money which has accumulated since 1992 from an oil procurement
deal between the Zambian government and a Kuwaiti company has not
been cleared and this led to the seeking of legal arbitration by the
company.
</P>
<P>
A London court has ruled recently that assets of the Zambian
Central Bank be frozen until such time that the debts have been paid.
</P>
<P>
Senior public relations officer of the central bank David Kalumba
revealed that there had been a number of cases in which the Bank of
Zambia had been sued by creditors.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Zambian government has not been able to
make any payments for the oil deal in Kuwait since 1992. enditem

<HEADLINE> Active Role for Chinese Farmers in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Yang Wanchun and Xu Shoucai have
become "farmer ambassadors" among Tongjiang's citizens, in the
city in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, and have even
opened offices in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is a farmer in Tongjiang, led a group of 80 farmers
to contract to manage six greenhouses and 80 hectares of land for
melons, vegetables, and grain in Nizhneleninskoe City in Russia.
Within half a year, they had earned themselves 4,000 tons of
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Xu, on the other hand, took 40 other farmers, and got lumber in
return for a contract for growing vegetables in Bikin City. He
also signed an agreement with the city to sell medical equipment
worth 200,000 yuan (about 24,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Farmers in a dozen counties or cities in the province have
got into agricultural production, construction, timber,
fisheries, and processing.
</P>
<P>
Farmers from the border city of Suifenhe were the first group
of Chinese to grow vegetables in Russia, and since 1990, have
been in the vanguard of Sino-Russian barter trade. They even
produced a 10-kg water melon, and their skill and hard work also
won the local people's admiration.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 60 companies owned by Chinese farmers are
playing an important role in the city's business. Some trading
companies, like Great Wall and Qianjin, have even set up
their businesses in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The city's farmers have cut quite a figure in the international
railway business by transporting tons of goods to and from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Another border city, Heihe, has been giving preferential
policies for farmers doing business. Business streets, retail
sales markets, farm produce markets, and fairs have been set up
all across the city.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1989, in Heilongjiang alone, more
than 10,000 people have gone to Russia annually to provide labor,
to do business, or to learn technical skills.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
today that the Clinton administration wanted the 20,000 U.S.
troops involved in the NATO peace implementation force in Bosnia
to be withdrawn from Bosnia by December 14.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is to have all U.S. troops out on or about the 14th
of December," Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff told the House
International Relations Committee. "There is no plan to delay the
withdrawal," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The date of December 14 marks the expiry of the NATO force's
one-year mandate, as outlined in the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Longstreth, the Pentagon's Bosnia Task Force director,
said that the Defense Department plans to "begin the withdrawal to
allow sufficient time to have the mandate completed by the
one-year point."
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon officials indicated that if the Bosnia
peacekeeping mission is extended under NATO leadership, U.S.
troops would be involved. They would likely be based in
neighboring countries to perform tasks such as command and
control, logistics, communications and other support functions.

HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- World awareness to the effects of
iodine deficiency last year saved the lives of at least 12
million children born to mothers who previously had low levels of
iodine, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in
harare on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior advisor on micro-nutrients at UNICEF headquarters in
New York David Alnwick said this development was a result of
efforts made in the universal salt iodisation over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
''Twelve million children per year have been saved from some
degree of mental retardation,'' Alnwick told an international
conference on the elimination of iodine deficiency disorders
(IDDS) in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Alnwick said UNICEF has data from 83 developing countries
around the world, which showed global progress in salt
iodization, a process which ensures adequate iodine intakes to
prevent diseases such as goitres and cretinism.
</P>
<P>
''At the end of 1995, 34 of these countries were iodising over
75 percent of their salt, and the proportion of salt being
iodised in most of the other countries was rapidly increasing,''
Alnwick said.
</P>
<P>
The conference which seeks to work out strategies for the
elimination of iodine deficiency disorders in the continent by
the year 2000, has attracted about 200 participants from 47
African countries. enditem

</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Zhang, who is on a four-day visit to

support and assistance in its return to peace and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, chairman of the Cambodian National Assembly, said
Cambodia attaches great importance to developing its friendly

He noted that King Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodian royal
government support China's cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
The speaker expressed the belief that the visit by Zhang and
his entourage will promote friendly relations between Cambodia and
China, and the two countries' armies and people.

lasting stability of the Asia-Pacific region as well as be
conducive to Cambodia's rehabilitation, reconstruction and
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Ernesto Leal today urged Honduras to return to the negotiating
table to break a one-year impasse over a boundary in the Caribbean
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Leal told a press conference here that Nicaragua will try to
renew negotiations since "as neighboring countries we cannot
continue without sea boundaries."
</P>
<P>
"We are in an impasse just because both sides have decided that
we will not change our positions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had held talks for more than a year, but no
way out was in sight as Nicaragua insisted its boundary extend as
far as the 17th parallel while Honduras would only recognize it up
to the 15th parallel.
</P>
<P>
Tensions increased recently when Managua decided to purchase
three patrol ships from Israel to maintain surveillance over the
disputed area in the Caribbean, a move Honduras called as
"provocative."
</P>
<P>
But Leal reassured that the purchase was for Managua's fight
against crimes in the sea and had nothing to do with the border
issue.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Nicaragua captured 104 Hondurans fishing in
waters under Nicaraguan jurisdiction, but freed them later.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Guerrillas Have No Base In Tanzania, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has refuted the allegations last week by Burundian authorities
that guerrillas based in Tanzania were using Lake Tanganyika as a
transit to hit targets in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Information, Research and Policy Planning in
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation,
Cyprian Majengo, told reporters here on Tuesday that the claims
were fabricated to undermine current efforts to resolve the
Burundi political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Lask week, the Pan African News Agency (PANA) reported a ban
on fishing in Lake Tanganyika imposed by the Burundian
authorities over the allegations that the lake was being used by
anti-government guerrillas based in Tanzania and Aaire as a
launching pad.
</P>
<P>
According to PANA, the ban was a result of persistent claims
by the army headquarters in Bujumbura that assailants from the
two neighbouring countries were passing through the lake to hit
targets in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Majengo said that always Tanzania had maintained her position
respecting the non-interference in domestic affairs of any
country and disallowing the refugees to use her territory as a
military incursion base against their country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government will continue respecting the
international law on refugees which among other things, bars a
host country to allow refugees to involve themselves in
activities vis a vis their country of origin, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retired President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere on Tuesday
held talks in Mwanza with two Burundi political parties, the
ruling Frodebu, a party dominated by the majority Hutus and the
opposition Uprona dominated by manority Tutsis. The talks are
aimed to seek ways to end the political conflicts stimmering in
Burundi since the October 23 1993 failed coup d'etat when Burundi
President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated by members of the
Burundi armed forces dominated by minority Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Form Groups for Three Gorges Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen big-name companies
worldwide have formed four groups to compete for the bids which
China will invite in the second quarter of this year for the
purchase of large turbogenerators for the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yangtze River Three Gorges Development
Corporation (YRTGDC), the major undertaker of this, the world's
largest water-control project, 14 out of a total of 26
turbogenerators, each with an installed capacity of 700,000 kw,
will be purchased through international bidding.
</P>
<P>
The total investment in the project is estimated at 200 billion
yuan (about 24 billion US dollars). Of the total, more than 100
billion yuan will go into core projects, while funds needed by the
electromechanical and electromechanical-related metal structures
will need one third of this amount.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the turbogenerators have roused great interest among
manufacturers across the world, said a spokesman for the YRTGDC.
</P>
<P>
Energomachexport, the Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod Joint
Stock Co. and the Electrosila Corporation have formed the Russian
group; the anglo-French GEC Alsthom, ABB of Switzerland and
Kavaerner of Norway have formed Europe's federation; German firms
Voith and Siemens have united with GE of Canada; and Japan's group
consists of Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, the Ito Corporation and the
Mitsui Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The groups have said that they will bring with them capital to
participate in the bidding. They are negotiating with their
countries' export credit agencies for support, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a number of well-known commercial banks have
expressed their intention to provide commercial loans matching
credit exports.
</P>
<P>
These banks are said to have realized that the loans involve
few risks because the project is backed by the Chinese government
and is sure to get export credits from other countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, involvement in the fund-raising activities will
provide commercial banks with opportunities to enter the Three
Gorges market and establish broad commercial links with
manufacturers participating in the bidding, the official
explained.

three times so as to inform the voters about the candidates in
their constituencies by giving the candidates' names and the
symbols they are contesting under, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise the air can announce the candidates and their symbols
in serial order, so that the voter has some basic information. At
the same time, the state-owned media could also chip in by urging
the voters with something such as "do come and vote."
</P>
<P>
The low-key campaign is a fallout of election expenditure
ceiling of a maximum of 450,000 rupees (about 12,900 US dollars)
for each seat in Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) as well as
the Indian Supreme Court's recent ruling which clubs the party's
expenditure to that of its candidate.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reduce Import Tax on Luxury Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has prepared to lower
import tariff on luxury goods as a measure to promote the
potential of Thailand to be a paradise of shoppers in the region,
Thai Finance Minister Surakiat Sathienthai said here today.
</P>
<P>
During the past four months, the Finance Ministry has studied
the measures to improve tax and tariff structures to increase
Thailand's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The customs tariff adjustment would help promote supportive
industry which is part of the plan to solve the problem of the
current account deficit that Thailand is suffering, Surakiat was
quoted by the Thai News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures to cut the Thai citizens' spending abroad
by lowering luxury goods' import tax had been approved by his
ministry and would be submitted to the cabinet for consideration
soon.
</P>
<P>
The move would help promote Thailand as a shopping center in
Asia which could pump up foreign money from tourists, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Southern Africa Enters New Era Of Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 24 (Xinhua)-- Zimbabwe and Zambia are insisting
on economic reforms and attracting more foreign investment in the
past few years, thus laying a foundation for future economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has made encouraging progress in its efforts to
resuscitate the economy which was ravaged by the protracted civil
war. Its GDP rose by three percent last year while its inflation
rate declined to 51 percent in 1995 from 71 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Angola, another war-torn nation in the region, has finally
started national rehibilitation as the peace process in the
country is moving steadily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new trend of regional economic cooperation and
integration has emerged in the region in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The leaders in the region have realized that regional cooperation
and integration are necessary because no single nation can achieve
sustained growth and development in isolation.
</P>
<P>
Against the background of emerging economic blocks in the world,
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was born out of the
loose Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) in
1992, marking an important step on the road towards the regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Plan of Action consisting of some 400 projects has
been worked out, which needs investment of about 8.5 billion US
Dollars. Scores of projects are being implemented to enhance the
regional cooperation in the fields of agriculture, mining,
transport, industry and human resources development, among
others.
</P>
<P>
A protocol on shared water course systems and a memorandum of
understanding on setting up a regional power pool were signed at
the SADC Summit last August. The two documents have charted
common strategies for the conservation and utilizatin of water in
this drought-prone region and closer coordination in the
developnment of hydro-electric and other power resources.
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries have held successive meetings since the
beginning of this year to map out common strategies for
expanding foreign trade, attracting investment, applying advanced
technologies, and enhancing bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a number of draft protocols on regional free
trade, free movement of people as well as cooperation in the
fields of food and agriculture, mining and tourism are in process
of development, according to the SADC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with rich natural resources, the SADC region has great
potential for economic development and cooperation. Under the new
historial conditions, the region's prospects for economic
development are more brilliant than ever before. enditem

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Foreign Trade Backed by Interior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region is relying on China's interior provinces and regions to
boost trade with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianguo, director of the regional bureau of foreign
economic co-operation and trade, said that more than 40 percent of
Xinjiang's import and export volume originates in other provinces
and regions. The figure reached about 500 million US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Until 1990, Xinjiang did not have any trade with the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In June 1992 the central government gave approval to Xinjiang's
three border cities of Yining, Tacheng and Bole and this regional
capital to open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang's foreign trade volume reached 1.428 billion US
dollars-worth last year, up from 459 million US dollars-worth in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Its annual trade seminars held here since 1992 have been
attended by about 10,000 overseas business people, and concluded
transactions worth a total of more than 7.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Without the trade seminars, Xinjiang's foreign trade could not
have developed so quickly," Wei noted.
</P>
<P>
To extend trade relations with other parts of the country, the
region is building its largest shopping center to display and sell
quality and brandname goods from all corners of the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts here predicted that the co-operation between Xinjiang
and interior parts of the country will surely enliven the trade
relations between Xinjiang and the neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Re-Exports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The value of re-exports in
Dubai in 1995 decreased 22.7 percent from that of 1994, Gulf News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing Dubai Customs Department statistics, said
that Dubai re-exported goods -- mostly in the form of machinery,
electrical equipment and textiles -- worth 883 million
U.S. dollars in 1995, down from 1.143 billion dollars in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the fall to the reduction of Iran's
import from Dubai, since the largest market of Dubai has been
controlling the hard currency for saving in order to service its
estimated foreign debt of some 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iran faces rescheduled annual debt
repayments of some 5 billion dollars, nearly a third of total budgeted
oil export revenues of 15.99 billion dollars.

JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
designated 13 integrated development areas in Indonesia's eastern
part (KTI) in an effort to accelerate the region's development, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the KTI development board here Tuesday,
Soeharto also decided to let the provinces in the KTI region to
enter into cooperation with other regions and foreign countries,
especially with provinces involved in the "SIJORI" Growth
Triangle, said Research and Technology minister Habibie, according

<P>
The 13 integrated economic development areas located in the
eastern region of Indonesia include East Timor, Maluku, Irian
Jaya, West and East Nusa Tenggara, Kalimantan and Sulawesi.

<P>
Compared with the western part of Indonesia, including Java and
Sumatra islands, the development of the eastern region has been
slow.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the eastern region is only about six percent
while the western region enjoys a growth rate of eight percent,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"To fully develop the eastern part, a 10 percent growth rate
must be achieved," he added.

percent in March compared with the previous month to 54.331
billion dollars, said the central bank.

dollars used for speculation.

<HEADLINE> Norway Urges Meeting on Third World Social Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Norway called on an
international conference today to improve basic social services in
the developing nations, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Overseas Development Minister Kari Nordheim-Larsen,
speaking at the start of a three-day meeting here, said the
conference should build on commitments made at a United Nations
social summit in Copenhagen last year.
</P>
<P>
About 120 delegates from 40 countries and organizations are
attending the meeting, on which they will discuss a follow-up to
some aspects of the Copenhagen summit.
</P>
<P>
Nordheim-Larsen said a so-called "20-20" formula, agreed in
Copenhagen, should help the Third World countries and their
industrialized partners to fulfill the commitments made on last
year's summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that by the end of this meeting we will be
able to demonstrate our readiness to translate the commitment we
made in Copenhagen into concrete terms," she said.
</P>
<P>
The "20-20" formula requires that 20 percent of development aid
be allocated to basic social programs while the recipient nation
in return spend 20 percent of its national budget on social needs.
</P>
<P>
However, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete
sounded notes of caution, saying that developing countries
suffering heavy debt burdens may have difficulties to achieve that
goal.

NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- India is likely to get an

three years, beginning July, in the recently approved 11th
replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA),
the Patriot reported today.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Alarming Lack of Fitness Among Chinese Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 24 (Xinhua)-- The sports grounds on Chinese
campuses seem to be more or less deserted these days, as a survey
indicates that more than half of Chinese university students take
no exercise whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
Although many young students can get worked up about spectator
sports and spectaculars such as the Olympic Games, they pay far
from enough attention to their own physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute
of the People's University here, shows that most students spend
their spare time "chatting" and "doing the assignments" instead of
taking part in sports.
</P>
<P>
Ball games are still popular on campuses, but sports such as
running and callisthenics are now almost forgotten by large
numbers of students.
</P>
<P>
Again, according to the survey, only 14 percent of students
take some kind of exercise every day. Moreover, their number has
been steadily shrinking in recent years. The survey finds that the
number of students engaging in physical exercise shrank by about
30 percent last year, compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
The survey stresses that the situation for female students and
graduate students is even more deplorable. Ten percent more
female students than male students "seldom" exercise.
</P>
<P>
The location of the universities is also found to have some
influence on whether students do physical exercises. The number of
students who do physical exercises regularly is smaller in
universities located in more-developed regions than in those in
less-developed regions, the survey notes.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Xiayang, who supervised the survey, said that the
survey highlights the urgency of the related departments to make
efforts to increase students' awareness of the importance of
physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
"I really worry about the situation, and something must be done
immediately," said Liu, who is also the deputy director of the
research institute.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Beijing University, one of the nation's
leading universities, has launched some regulations to encourage
students to take more physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Anmo, vice-president of Beijing University,
besides two hours of physical education weekly, the students are
also required to master a sport such as swimming.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to make our students able to work healthily for society
for 50 years," the vice-president said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Southern Africa Enters New Era Of Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 24 (Xinhua)-- Countries in southern Africa have
concentrated their efforts on economic development and seeking of
suitable development patterns in recent years after acquisition of
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The southern African region, which had been beset by
disturbances for more than a dozen years, has ushered in the new
era after realizing peace and stability in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the region has witnessed the birth of a new
South Africa, the successful holding of general elections in
Mozambique following the end of a 16-year-long civil war, the
remarkable progress in Angola's peace process, and the
achievement of gradual political stability in other
countries in the region after experiencing upheavals caused by
transition to multi-party system.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability in the region have provided more
favorable conditions than ever before for regional economic
development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The southern African countries should seize the opportunity for
economic development as the region had entered the era of peace and
stability, pointed out a communique issued by the 1995 Annual Summit
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation, the countries in the region are
implementing various economic reform policies with a view to
resuscitating and promoting their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
South Africa recorded a three-percent economic growth rate last
year, the highest in the past 10 years, as a result of the
implementation of the reconstruction and development scheme. Its
volume of trade with other African countries has increased by 50
percent since the lifting of the United Nations sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has made positive results in the economic reforms,
registering an annual economic growth rate of some four percent in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana have progressed steadily, due to their
suitable policies since independence. Namibia's economy has
been developing at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent in the
past five year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. diplomats and their
colleagues from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
have met in New York to discuss a U.S. proposal to hold four-party
talks on the future of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Glyn Davies said today that the
April 19 meeting took place at the "working level," at which DPRK
officials asked questions about the proposal announced by
President Clinton during his visit to South Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting we answered some of the questions put to us
about the proposal. We continue to urge the North Koreans to
accept the proposal and have yet to receive a formal North Korean
response," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described it "a positive sign that they're asking
questions." "But what we would like to see is a definitive sign
that they are interested in taking this up," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and DPRK were still discussing procedural
issues on opening liaison offices in each other's capitals, Davies
said, adding that most of the issues have been resolved.

<HEADLINE> Disease Threatens Shrimp Industry in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A highly contagious disease, which
has no cure or treatment, is threatening Bangladesh's shrimp
industry as large numbers of shrimp are dying of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Directorate of Fisheries (DOF) said here today
that the disease, identified as "white spot" disease, has most
recently hit shrimp cultivation in the greater Khulna area,
southwest of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which attacks salt water shrimp such as "bagda"
(black tiger shrimp), has never occurred before in such a
widespread manner in the shrimp farms of this country, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Fishery officials are almost certain that the disease was
brought in along with shrimp fry imported from Thailand and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the Department of Fisheries, two
thirds of the 30,000 hectares under bagda cultivation in Satkhira
district, and nearly half of the 28,000 hectares in Khulna
district have already been infected by the "white spot" disease.
</P>
<P>
Affected shrimp normally die before reaching marketable size.
</P>
<P>
Losses in export of bagda, which accounts for approximately 70
percent of all shrimp produced in the country, could amount to
over 150 million US dollars, industry exports said.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp industry, the third largest export industry in
Bangladesh, totally earned over 250 million dollars in 1994-95.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israel to Discuss Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry said today that he would discuss Israeli anti-missile
defenses with Prime Minister Shimon Peres when the latter comes to
Washington this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering in downtown Washington of the
Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish rights group, Perry said that he
and Peres will discuss theater missile defense and other weapons
systems the two countries are jointly developing to further
bolster Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Peres would visit Washington from
Sunday to Tuesday, during which he and Perry would sign a
memorandum on joint missile defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Israel are jointly developing systems
such as the Arrow anti-tactical missile system and high-energy
lasers that will be able to knock rockets and lasers out of the
air closer to their launcher point than previous systems," Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also looking at some new initiatives in the area
dealing with early warning. All of these programs we will he
discussing very seriously and in a very substantive way with the
prime minister when he is here this weekend," he added.
</P>
<P>
Perry vowed once again that the United States would continue to
ensure Israel's military superiority in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I am the secretary of defense for the United
States, we will maintain the qualitative edge in Israel."
</P>
<P>
To attain that end, the United States provides Israel with 3
billion dollars a year in foreign aid, 1.8 billion dollars of it
for defense.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
returned 124 million dollars to Pakistan as part of the money paid
years ago for F-16 fighter jets that were never delivered.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal to buy 60 F-16 jets from the United States for a
total of 1.5 billion dollars, Pakistan in 1989 paid 658 million
dollars of the total. Washington later held up the aircraft sale
simply on suspicion that Pakistan was developing a nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
It was not until January this year that the United States
agreed to return the money to Pakistan. Meanwhile, Washington is
seeking new customers for the F-16s originally intended to be
delivered to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani ambassador here today received two checks of 62
million dollars each. The embassy said that discussions were
continuing on reimbursement of the remainder of the money for the
jets.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The US Northwest Airlines will
open a new flight to China on May 3. The Detroit-Beijing flight
will be the company's first non-stop one between the US and China.
</P>
<P>
The US carrier at present operates three flights a week between
the US and China via Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
With China's increasing popularity as a tourist destination,
said Christine Betzer, Beijing-based sales manager for Northwest,
there is growing demand for more routes and services to China.
</P>
<P>
Alfred W. Brader, China manager for Austrian Airlines,
estimated that the number of Austrian tourists to China tripled in
the one year since Austrian Airlines opened the first
Vienna-Beijing route last March.
</P>
<P>
Brader said his company is seeking to expand its services to
Beijing and open new ones to other Chinese cities such as
Shanghai, and "we expect to have three flights a week to Beijing
next year".
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines has increased the number of its flights to
Beijing from the original seven to ten a week since March 31.
</P>
<P>
More carriers have recently obtained approval from China's
civil aviation authorities for new routes or flights to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao, which already operates two routes from Macao to
Beijing and Shanghai, is soon to start a new service to Xiamen,
while Royal Dutch Airlines plans to open its first China route in
June, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC).
</P>
<P>
The CAAC has so far granted approval to 47 overseas carriers to
operate China services, including many of the world's leading ones
such as United Airlines, Lufthansa and Scandinavian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
China currently boasts an annual growth rate of over 20 percent
in air traffic, one of the highest in the world, and has
established air links with nearly 40 countries, according to the
CAAC.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Navy officier who had served
on U.S. nuclear missile submarines was arrested Monday on charges
of espionage, the FBI said today.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Machinist Mate First Class Kurt G.
Lessenthien, 29, was enlisted in the Navy in 1984 and currently on
active duty as an instructor at the Navy Nuclear Power School in
Orlando, Florida, where submarine crews are trained.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said that the case involved an attempted sale of top
secret information to the representative of a foreign government
but that "to date, no classified defense information was
successfully provided...to any foreign interest or government."
</P>
<P>
"We got information from a confidential source that he was in
the market to make money by selling secrets, but he never hooked
up with a real foreign agent," Navy Commander Stephen Pietropaoli
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"An FBI agent posing as a foreign representative approached him
and met with him at an Orlando, Flo., motel. The agent paid him
cash; he handed over what he said were classified documents and
then they arrested him. He was dealing the entire time with U.S.
agents," Piotropaoli said.
</P>
<P>
Lessenthien's case was investigated by the FBI and the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.

<HEADLINE> World Trade System Faced with Major Challenges: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The convergence of regionalism
and multilateralism is a main challenge facing the world
multilateral trading system, Renato Ruggiero, director-general of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) said here today, stressing the
need for governments around the world to respond to the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the two-day World Trade Congress, which opened here
today, Ruggiero said that as they consider the points on the
first WTO Ministerial Conference agenda, governments should also
have in mind the need to respond to three major challenges which
confront the multilateral system as the world approaches the new
century.
</P>
<P>
He said the main challenge is to ensure that national barriers
are not just replaced by regional ones, but that, on the contrary,
regionalism and multilateralism converge at the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
"I see this as the main challenge facing the multilateral
system at present, one which will shape its future and help shape
the world of the 21st century," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge facing the multilateral system, as the WTO
Chief outlined, is to respect and strengthen the fundamental
contract that now unites countries at all levels of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The industrialized world has to keep open its markets and
improve their openness in the years ahead, while the developing
countries have to continue with their liberalizing reforms and
increase their integration into the global system, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The third challenge, Ruggiero pointed out, is to accept the
shared responsibility, shared among existing WTO members and those
countries wishing to become members, for constructing what he
described as "a truly universal system which all the present and
future candidate can join in and contribute to."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700 participants, including government ministers, senior
officials, eminent businessmen and prominent academicians from
Asia, America, and Europe, are attending the two-day World Trade
Congress, co-organized by the Singapore Trade Development Board
(TDB) and the International Herald Tribune, to discuss issues
related to the evolution and efficacy of the 120-member WTO.
</P>
<P>
Barry Desker, chief executive office of the TDB, said the
inputs from the private sector and academia at the Congress would
be compiled to be used as a reference for the first WTO
Ministerial Conference, to be held in Singapore in December this
year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Double Pulp Export This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to double its pulp export in 1996 from last year's 577,812 tons to
1.15 million tons, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Product Director of the Trade and Industry Ministry
Gato Ibnu Santosa told a seminar here Tuesday said Indonesia, one
of the largest pulp exporting countries in the world, earned 1.45
billion US dollars from pulp and paper exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Pulp and paper made up 3.19 percent of the country's total
exports of non-oil and gas commodities in 1995. The figure
represented a 98.02 percent increase over that in 1994, he added.

<HEADLINE> Panama Won't Negotiate With U.S. Over Bases: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Panama has for now ruled out
any negotiations with the U.S. over the future of its military
bases in the country after the year 2000, President Ernesto Perez
Balladares said today.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't close the door completely to talks and said there
was still the possibility of exploring the issue at the request of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president also promised to consult the nation
about any agreement to prolong the U.S. military presence in
Panama.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on his recent three-nation
European tour, Balladares dismissed any connection between the
continuation of U.S. bases and the war against drugs
trafficking. He said the government is determined to continue the
war against drugs "with or without the North Americans."
</P>
<P>
The United States has eight military bases and some 7,500
troops in Panama. It is due to return the Panama Canal to
Panamanian rule and withdraw all its troops from the country by
December 31, 1999, under a treaty signed by the two countries in
1977.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is seeking to keep a military presence in Panama after
the handover. But talks were suspended in November 1995 as the
two sides failed to agree on leasing fees for the U.S. bases.
</P>
<P>
President Balladeres' tour of Belgium, Italy and France earlier
in April was partly aimed at assuring users of the canal about its
future after the U.S. handover in 1999 and encouraging European
investment in the canal zones.
</P>
<P>
The President also signed an agreement with some of Panama's
international bank creditors to restructure its debts, which
should lead to a 30 percent reduction in repayments amounting to
some one billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Evaluates Crisis in Paraguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso summoned his military advisors today to evaluate
possible repercussions of the crisis in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan Army Commander Lino Cesar Oviedo rebelled against
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's Monday decision to remove him,
triggering a political-military crisis in the South American
country.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo has been confined to barracks with his troops in the
cavalry regiment.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, acting Foreign Minister Sebastian DO Rego
Barros has reportedly left this afternoon for Asuncion, the
Paraguayan capital, to watch closely at the development of the
incident in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
A presidential press advisor said President Cardoso had a
telephone conversation Monday with Wasmosy and Uruguayan President
Julio Maria Sanguinetti after he learned of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, General Oviedo has finally dropped
his rebellious attitude and agreed to obey the president's order.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo said in a tape recording disseminated by the army's
Communications Office that he will hand over his post to General
Oscar Diaz Delmas today.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Oviedo will become the new defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo said the announcement would be made after he had talks
with Wasmosy who has not confirmed or denied the information.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Moves to Fewer Meetings: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of ESCAP
Adrianus Mooy said today the organization is moving to reduce the
number of meetings it organizes each year as part of its reform
program.
</P>
<P>
Mooy also said that the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) will also improve the
quality of its publications so that they become more informative
and be of more value to its members.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a statement made on Tuesday by US
ambassador to Thailand, William Itoh, to the ongoing ESCAP 52nd
Session, which closes later today.
</P>
<P>
The US ambassador urged ESCAP to speed up reform, "meet less
and do more," and "eliminate some programs to reinvest in new,
more relevant activities."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to expect a cost-effective, well-organized ESCAP
that addresses the high-priority issues of its members while
eliminating those activities determined to be of marginal value,"
the US statement said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mooy said that the US statement has focused on
reform only, which is one of the crises the UN system is facing.
The other crisis is lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
The US is under widespread criticism for failing in making its
financial contributions to the 185-member United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2.9 billion dollars owed by member states to the UN, the
US share is 1.2 billion dollars, Mooy said.
</P>
<P>
"The two are very closely related.... We need a certain degree
of financial stability if we are to carry out reform," Mooy said.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP has set April 1997, its 50th anniversary, as the target
date for completion of the strategy for overall reform of the
organization, which now has 50 full members and 10 associate
members in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report: Public Spending Cuts Affect Education Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Public spending cuts often eat
away at education spending in some of the world's poorest nations,
a United Nations specialized agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The findings, by the Geneva-based International Labor
Organization (ILO), were made public with the release of a report
prepared for a meeting of educational experts.
</P>
<P>
"Most countries spend much of their government budgets on
schooling and a very high fraction of educational spending goes
for teachers' salaries," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it said, cuts in public spending have "major
implications for education and teachers."
</P>
<P>
In addition, pressure to reduce overall spending often lead
governments to cut education spending, the report said, adding
that education budget has seen almost no rise in the poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impact on education was particularly harmful
because an improvement in labor force skills was vital in view of
new goods, services and production procedures needed to compete
and stimulate growth in the 80s and 90s," it concluded.
</P>
<P>
The ILO also criticized the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund for imposing policies on developing countries that
make reducing public spending an important condition for loans.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Curb Credit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand, the
country's central bank, will step up its control of credit
extensions by foreign bank branches and finance companies in a
fresh move to rein in inflation and the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
In July, finance companies will be subject to a 0.5 percent
rise in the capital requirement to 7.5 percent covering the
capital to risk-weight assets ratio, according to Bank Governor
Vijit Supinit.
</P>
<P>
The increased ratio, in addition to the five monetary measures
launched recently, will strengthen the banks and finance
companies' positions and help curb inflation and the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Previous orders include the requirement that banks increase
their capital-to-risk asset ratio to 8.5 percent from 8 percent
and foreign banks from 6.75 percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Regarding credit growth control, Vijit did not specify the
amount, but said the loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratios of finance
companies and foreign branches should be lowered.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand sees the revision necessary as the
companies have extended large amounts of credit to the real estate
sector. However, the LTD control is expected to aggravate the
negative impact of the banks' operations, directly affecting their
lending capacities, according to insiders.
</P>
<P>
The LTD control will mainly disturb banks which rely largely on
overseas funds and focus on retail banking.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to slow down short-term capital inflows,
which now account for 70 percent of the total influx.
</P>
<P>
Currently the LTD of finance companies is 130 percent. Last
year, their credit growth reached 25.4 percent, lower than the
29.6 percent expected.
</P>
<P>
This year, the target has been revised down due to declining
outstanding credits totaling one trillion baht (40 billion U.S.
dollars), or one fourth of the banking system.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Ready to Join ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk said today his country would follow France's advice to
join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the king at a lunch with Prime Minister Alain Juppe
on the second day of his three-day state visit expressed his
personal reluctance to the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
"I was never for ASEAN, I am for total independence, a neutral
Cambodia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In explaining Cambodia's decision to move closer toward ASEAN,
the 73-year-old king said: "As I am a francophile and France
said 'go-ahead, join,' then I will."
</P>
<P>
"France gives solidarity with the rest of Europe as an example,
it wants us to do the same," Sihanouk added.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, like Laos, is expected to join ASEAN, which groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk arrived in France on Friday for a three-day private
stay before going on official. The visit is his first outside
Asia since returning to the throne in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It's also the first state visit to France by any foreign leader
since President Jacques Chirac took office 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
France, the former colonial power in Southeast Asia, is the
second aid donor to Phnom Penh after Japan.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Join New NATO Military Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- France is ready to take part in
a "new military structure" in NATO, the country's top military
officer said today after taking part in its first meeting of
the alliance's military committee for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"The notion of an integrated military structure no longer
exists ... from now on we speak of a new structure or of a future
structure." Jean-Philippe Douin told reporters after the meeting
of the chiefs-of-staff of NATO's 16 members.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the first attended by France since 1966
when the then President Charles de Gaulle pulled the country out
NATO's integrated military structure complaining of
U.S. domination.
</P>
<P>
France, which announced last December it was moving closer to
NATO's military wing, has been one of the most vocal supporters of
a stronger European voice in the alliance, one of the reforms now
being debated by NATO chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Douin said that if NATO reform went ahead, there were no
obstacles he could foresee to full French participation.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Either the new structure will be adopted or it
will not be. If it will not be, we will not come."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Reforming Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been reforming its
banking system in three stages to support its sustained economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Private banks and foreign bank representative offices were
allowed as the first phase since the enactment of new banking and
financial institutions laws in 1990, followed by the establishment
of joint venture banks between private banks and foreign banks
which had opened representative offices in Myanmar as the second
phase and the opening of foreign branch banks for operation as the
third phase.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, 15 domestic private banks
have been permitted operation in addition to the six state banks
and one state insurance institution.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 32 foreign banks were allowed to open
representative offices in Myanmar. They are from 15 countries and
regions including Thailand, Singapore, France, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Bangladesh, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, Myanmar's banking reform entered into the
second stage allowing the establishment of joint venture banks
between local private banks and foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
More and more foreign financial institutions and organizations
are coming here to study Myanmar's financial status and seek
opportunities of investment in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Myanmar's State Economic Bank and Japan's
Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. reached an agreement to set up a
joint venture securities exchange center company to assist in
building the infrastructure and in implementing the related
functions till the emergence of a stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> Mass Hunger Strike Planned for Bangladeshi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Jatiya (National) Party, one of
the major political parties in Bangladesh, has announced a program
of "mass hunger strike" across the country Thursday to press for
the release of its jailed chairman and the country's ex-president
H.M. Ershad.
</P>
<P>
Ershad took power in the early 1980s and was forced to step
down in 1989. Afterwards, he was arrested and sentenced to
imprisonment on corruption charges by the authorities under the
Khaleda Zia government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
Announcing the program at its grand rally here Tuesday, JP
Acting Chairman Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury said that it is the
constitutional right of Ershad to go to his electorate to present
his party's program for the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no election without releasing our leader,"
Mizanur said, urging the party supporters to continue the movement
for Ershad's release and the election campaign simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the caretaker government not to create a
situation that might hamper the neutrality of the polls and
threatened of "tougher agitation" for non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
Without Ershad's release, there could not be a free and fair
election, the acting chairman stressed.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Report: World Science Need More Money, More Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations report suggests
that nations around the world should spend at least 0.4 percent of
their gross national product (GNP) on research and development by
2000, and let more women get into laboratories.
</P>
<P>
World Science Report 1996, released today by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), says
that many countries, especially those in the developing world, are
not spending enough money on science research.
</P>
<P>
Many young women are refused or discouraged to enter the
research circles, both because of the stubborn sex barriers that
long prevail in many nations and because women get less salaries
than their male colleagues, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan lead the world in spending on
science at 2.8 percent of GNP, followed by the 15-member European
Union (EU) with an average spending of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in developing countries, most nations spend their limited
capital on raising people's living standards and creating new
market and jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is almost universal support for this idea of
science as an engine of economic and social improvement ... in
many parts of the world there is still a lack of political
commitment to science,'' said UNESCO Director-General Federico
Mayor.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a traditionally science leader, could risk undermining
its drive toward a market economy by slashing science spending at
an unprecedented low level of 0.8 percent of GNP -- roughly the
same as Iceland and Ireland, observers pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Since many developing nations cannot afford high costs on
science research, the gap between them and the developed countries
could be widened, some critics expressed their worries.

WARSAW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The extremely long and cold winter
which has just passed inflicted heavy losses on Poland's
agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
About 66 percent of rape, 42 percent of winter barley and 6
percent of winter wheat were destroyed because of the severe
cold. The agricultural provinces such as Skierniewice, Gorzow and
Warsaw were worst hit.
</P>
<P>
Experts said those crops which had survived the freezing season
may face an impending drought triggered by the belated spring. So
there would be an inevitable reduction in the output.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government said the output cut would surely lead to
a rise in the prices of agricultural products and called on all
departments to make concerted efforts to reduce the decrease to the
minimum.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the heavy burden put on farmers by the price surge,
the government would provide low-interest loans for them and
increase the circulating fund they would spend on seeds,
fertilizers, fuels and agricultural chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that some 150,000 farmers got low-interest
loans in the first two months of this year and that there would be
more applicants for the loans in the coming months.

<HEADLINE> Old Oilfields to Produce Into Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The aging oil fields in the
eastern part of China will remain the major oil producers into the
early part of the next century, with the annual oil output
forecast at 115 million tons by the year 2000, or 90 percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp.(CNPC), the oilfields in eastern China, the output
of which accounts for over 90 percent of the country's total, have
succeeded in controlling the rate of natural output decline within
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these oilfields have accelerated prospecting to push
the oil production capacity to 64 million tons, thus maintaining
output.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2000, Daqing, Shengli and
Liaohe, three of the country's leading oilfields, will stabilize
their outputs at 53 million tons, 26.5 million tons and 15.5
million tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the annual outputs of the Huabei, Dagang and
Jilin oilfields will reach around five million tons each. The
output of the Jiangsu Oilfield in east China exceeded one million
tons last year, and it is expected to maintain its growth
trend. Other oilfields such as those of Zhongyuan, Henan and
Jianghan, also report growth in production.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official said that by the year 2000 China's onshore
oil output is expected to hit between 145 million tons and 150
million tons, of which some 29.5 million tons will be turned out
by the oilfields in the western and central parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Join New NATO Military Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- France is ready to take part in
a "new military structure" in NATO, the country's top military
officer said today after taking part in its first meeting of
the alliance's military committee for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"The notion of an integrated military structure no longer
exists ... from now on we speak of a new structure or of a future
structure." Jean-Philippe Douin told reporters after the meeting
of the chiefs-of-staff of NATO's 16 members.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the first attended by France since 1996
when the then President Charles de Gaulle pulled the country out
NATO's integrated military structure complaining of
U.S. domination.
</P>
<P>
France, which announced last December it was moving closer to
NATO's military wing, has been one of the most vocal supporters of
a stronger European voice in the alliance, one of the reforms now
being debated by NATO chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Douin said that if NATO reform went ahead, there were no
obstacles he could foresee to full French participation.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Either the new structure will be adopted or it
will not be. If it will not be, we will not come."

<HEADLINE> World Trade Congress Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Congress opened
here today with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urging the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to view regional initiatives as
markers or leading indicators of the achievable.
</P>
<P>
Regional trade arrangements, rather than posing a threat to the
multilateral trading system, are the building blocs of trade
infrastructure, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of regional ventures undertaken by the OECD, APEC,
and ASEAN on trade and investment, can form the basis of
discussions, or even negotiations, within the WTO at a future
date, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO should view regional initiatives as markers or leading
indicators of the achievable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the WTO's agenda must adapt to the
changing global environment, and to the pace set by the regional
trading arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it risks becoming marginalized and irrelevant to
the business community," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700 participants, including government ministers, senior
officials, eminent businessmen and prominent academicians from
Asia, America, and Europe, are attending the two-day World Trade
Congress, co-organized by the Singapore Trade Development Board
(TDB) and the International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
Barry Desker, chief executive officer of the TDB, said the
inputs from the private sector and academia at the Congress would
be compiled to be used as a reference for the first WTO
Ministerial Conference, to be held in Singapore in December this
year.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Denies Presidential Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government today denied a report in the Barcelona-based La
Vanguardia newspaper that President Ernesto Samper had considered
stepping down as a solution to a political crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The president has not contemplated stepping down from power as
a solution to the political crisis; if this were the most
convenient solution for the country, it would already have been
taken," Secretary General to the President Jose Antonio Vargas
Lleras said in a letter to La Vanguardia.
</P>
<P>
Samper, publicly criticized for receiving funds from the Cali
drug cartel in his 1994 presidential election campaign, is now
under investigation by the House Accusation Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona newspaper wrote that, doubting the results of the
investigations and the political crisis, Samper wanted to resign
from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Vargas noted in the letter that the La Vanguardia said
"inexplicably, and without any proof" that Samper "had already
decided to resign and that he was supposedly negotiating with the
vice president the conditions for his withdrawal from the
government."
</P>
<P>
"To that respect I hereby declare," added the letter, "that
this information is completely false."
</P>
<P>
He continued that "the truth is that the honorable Chamber of
Representatives has ended the investigation process and we are
certain that this process will terminate by reiterating the
innocence of the chief executive."
</P>
<P>
Vargas pointed out that Samper himself has said at the end of
the process in the House that he himself will present the country
with a solution to the current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening is that some adversaries of the government
in Colombia confuse a solution to the crisis with the president's
departure, in which, of course, they are also mistaken," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Samper submitted to questioning before the House Accusation
Committee today for the third time in less than 6 months.

</P>
<P>
The "City" compact, which was launched in Bangkok Tuesday, is
designed and manufactured especially for the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Honda expects the sales of all three Honda models -- the Civic,
Accord and City -- in Thailand to total about 45,000 units this
year, and it aims to become the number one in the passenger car
segment with annual sales of 60,000 units by 1998.

<P>
URUMQI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Although she is Russian, she has
devoted herself to agricultural education and scientific research
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for nearly
50 years.
</P>
<P>
She is one of the more than 10,000 Russians now living in
Xinjiang, all of them descendants of people who have come from
Russia since the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
Valitina Tubanova, a professor at Xinjiang Agricultural
University, is one of the most outstanding, and has had a number
of noteworthy achievements in plant cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Tubanova does research on saussurea, a genus of herbs found
mainly in temperate and cool regions, and has successfully
propagated it through tissue cultures.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens of saussurea, grown on her experimental plots
for four years, are expected to be planted outdoor next year.
</P>
<P>
Tubanova is also a master of the Russian, Chinese and Uygur
languages. She became a teacher at the Xinjiang Agricultural
University after graduating from college and has worked there for
more than 30 years. Of her several thousands of students, many
have become agricultural specialists.
</P>
<P>
She did not halt her research when she retired in 1989, but
went on to make several discoveries in plant tissue culture.
</P>
<P>
Her research on potatoes helped solve virus and storage
problems.
</P>
<P>
She did successful research on wild licorice tissue culture,
which provided technology for afforestation of sandy areas in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
What she worries about most is that many hi-tech achievements
cannot be used because of lack of funds, "I can't let my
achievements stay in the laboratory, I want to contribute more to
the state."
</P>
<P>
Tubanova is also active in political affairs. She has been a
member of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference since 1982, and
acted as a Standing Committee member of the regional CPPCC
committee for nine years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or more, she has put forward a series of
proposals on building Russian schools, and enrolling Russian
college students.

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi to Develop Railway Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi Province in east China
will spend one billion yuan on the development of small towns
along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which runs 707 km across the
province.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the money will be spent on 100 towns and
100 villages which are models of rural housing, and the training
of technicians and skilled workers for the towns.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 200-odd small towns, most of which are in
the vicinity of major highways or railways.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which is expected to open by the
end of the year, runs through 22 counties and cities in Jiangxi,
which hold 25 percent of the province's total area and 30 percent
of its population. It will have 55 stations in Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
The officials believe that the railway will bring them a
valuable chance to develop the local economy.
</P>
<P>
These towns will eventually become important bases for the
production and processing of farm products and raw materials as
well as other industries, they said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Telecom Market Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
one of the richest local economies in the country, is expected to
see a huge demand for telecommunications network equipment and
terminal products over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuedao, deputy director of the Guangdong Posts and
Telecommunications Bureau, said that the province needs more than
four million telephones every year. Other telecom terminal
products, including modems, broad-band and narrow-band interface
equipment, and multimedia terminals will also see swelling sales
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
But the traditional small switches without integrated functions
will lose their market share soon.
</P>
<P>
The localization rate of telecom equipment will be improved,
with the program-controlled switching systems manufactured by
joint ventures and domestic enterprises gradually replacing the
dominance of foreign brands in China's telecom market.
</P>
<P>
The province will invest 15 billion yuan (about 1.8 billion US
dollars) in the telecom industry this year, not including
handsets, mobile phones and modems, according to the "People's
Posts and Telecommunications Daily".
</P>
<P>
So far, Guangdong has the most complete telecommunications
system in China, boasting a telephone switching capacity of 20
million lines and 13 million telephone users. Its telephone
density reached 24 percent, and the switching capacity of mobile
phone network stands at four million channels.
</P>
<P>
The province will shift its focus to the development of a
large-capacity digital transmission network and broad-band
intelligent service this year. By the end of this century, a
high-speed broad-band telecommunications network will take shape
in the Pearl River Delta, the richest region of Guangdong, laying
a foundation for the construction of the "information
superhighway" in the province.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Seeks Investment from Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan hopes that Thailand
could invest in its energy and gold and coal mining industries, a
Tajik official said here.
</P>
<P>
Makhmudov Isroil, first deputy minister for economy and foreign
relations of Tajikistan, who was on an official visit to Thailand,
met with Thai Deputy Industry Minister Anusorn Wongwan in Bangkok
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anusorn told Isroil that Tajikistan has a good potential as an
investment haven thanks to the availability of natural resources
and low wages in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many factories in Tajikistan have closed down following the
departure of Russians since it gained independence from Moscow in
1991, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that investment in Tajikistan might be
problematic because of the political instability and lack of good
transportation. There is also no direct flight to and from
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Anusorn said the Tajik official also hoped that the Thai
government could open a direct flight from Bangkok.

BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-three German soldiers were
convicted of extreme right-wing offenses last year, mostly for
using or displaying symbols of banned rightist organizations.
</P>
<P>
But the government doesn't believe the convictions are a sign
of a growing extreme-right trend in the army, as the soldiers
account for less than 0.2 percent of the total, a parliamentary
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of offenders in 1995 is higher than the 1994 figure

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebel Leader's Death Yet to Be Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The death of Chechen separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in Russian troops' missile strike on
Tuesday is yet to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Dudayev's former chief
negotiator at talks with Moscow, Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, said
earlier today that Dudayev was killed late on April 21.
</P>
<P>
Yarikhanov said that he had seen "Dudayev's dead body with his
own eyes." He also said that Dudayev's former deputy Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, former Vice President of the Chechen Republic of
Ichkeria, had succeeded as the head of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted the government of Ichkeria as saying that
Russian troops' missile strike hit the working emplacement of
Dudayev on the evening of April 21, when he was conversing by
satellite telephone with the mediator about conditions for talks
with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he was seriously wounded and died on the same day
in the village of Gekhi Chu, 30 kilometers southwest of the
Chechen capital of Grozny, Itar-Tass said, adding that some of his
closest associates had died together.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of high-ranking Chechen separatist officials
have denied reports on Dudayev's death, the Interfax news agency
reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Saipudi Khasanov, personal secretary of Dudayev
as saying that the Chechen separatist leader "is alive and working
as usual."
</P>
<P>
Interfax also quoted one of Dudayev's followers in an overseas
office as saying that he received a satellite phone call from
Dudayev at about 17:00 Moscow time (GMT 15:00) today and they
discussed normal business. He said the reports of Dudayev's death
are a provocation and totally untrue.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax, Khasan Khazuyev, Deputy Prime Minister
in Dudayev's separatist government, has dismissed as "bluff" the
reports that Dudayev was killed.
</P>
<P>
"Should this happen, I would be the first to learn that because
I have direct contacts with Dudayev," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla Bugayev, First Deputy Prime Minister of the
Moscow-backed Chechen government told the Interfax that he has no
information proving the death of Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors about the murder of the separatist leader are indeed
circulating in the republic, but all of them are based solely on
media reports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official representatives of the Russian troops
command told the Interfax tonight that they were unaware of the
death of Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass reports said that the Russian government announced
that it had received no word whatsoever from formal sources which
could confirm the rebel leader's death.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 51, has led an armed resistance against the Russian
forces in the breakaway republic of Chechnya for over 16
months. The conflict has left over 30,000 people dead.

</P>
<P>
Against Italian Andrea Gaudenzi, the 25-year-old Spaniard won

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PA Calls on Government to Expel Israeli Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of Egypt's People's
Assembly (PA) today called on the government to expel Israel's
ambassador and recall its own ambassador to Israel to protest
against Israel's attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported that at a
parliamentary session focused on Israel's aggression on south
Lebanon, the deputies also asked Jordan to follow Egypt's example
and urged an immediate suspension of all Arab steps to normalize
relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The call came amid mounting anger in the Arab and Moslem world
over Israel's 13-day campaign in retaliation for Iran-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas' shelling in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since the hostilities began, more than 100 people have been
killed, most of them Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PA Speaker Ahmed Fathi Sorour announced at the end
of the session that no People's Assembly delegation will be
allowed to visit Israel at present.
</P>
<P>
"The parliament is the voice of the people. So long as the
people are angry with Israel, no representatives of the people
will travel to Israel to talk with those who chose the language of
war and preferred it over that of peace," Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
He added that no parliamentarians will visit Israel until the
peace process is resumed.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian delegation was scheduled to travel to Israel
according to a decision taken by the parliamentary executive
committee within the framework of the dialogue to realize a just
and all-out regional peace, according to Sorour.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic ties
with Israel, but relations between the two sides have stayed cool,
even in comparatively peaceful times.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls on GA to Condemn, Punish Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias
Hraoui on Tuesday called upon the U.N. General Assembly to condemn
and punish Israel for its crimes against Lebanon, which led to the
deaths of up to 175 people.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal in a General Assembly meeting
called by the Non-aligned Movement on the situation caused by the
Israeli military actions in Southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We expected the world to help us develop our reconstruction
capabilities. Instead, we come to you today bearing the blood of
our innocent people and bearing witness to our hopes that were
shattered by Israel: that is our faith in international legitimacy
to recover our rights," said Hraoui.
</P>
<P>
"We came here in the hope that we shall all stand firmly and
decisively together against aggression and transgression, against
the heinous crimes that go unpunished," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon, the
president said that Security Council Resolution 425 should be
implemented so that Lebanese security forces could assume
responsibility for security in the areas of the south and western
Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the General Assembly is
considering a draft resolution condemning recent Israeli attacks
on Southern Lebanon and calling upon it to withdraw from Southern
Lebanon. The meeting will continue on Wednesday.

BONN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors have decided to accept

International Ski Federation (FIS) officials over the death of
Ulrike Maier.
</P>
<P>
At the court in Munich, the prosecutors agreed to an offer of

The money would be paid to Maier's six-year-old daughter

</P>

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Police Arrests Mosque Bombing Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade police has arrested two
persons on suspicion of planting explosives outside religious
buildings and under cars in the 1992-1994 period, a police
statement said today.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandar Gajic, aged 34, and Milan Dobrilovic, aged 33, are
suspected of planting an explosive device in the compound of the
Bajrakli Mosque in downtown Belgrade on December 8, 1992, causing
damages. The mosque has been targeted seven times since 1990. The
latest attack took place last week during which the facade of the
16-century mosque was damaged.
</P>
<P>
The group was believed to have made another bombing on May 26,
1993, when Dobrilovic apparently lobbed an explosive device into
the compound of St. Anthony, a Roman Catholic Church in Belgrade,
also causing damage.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the arrest, police found 1.9 kg of explosives,
three hand grenades, three pistols, a scorpio automatic gun,
munitions and detonators at the hideout of the bombing suspects.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF End Spring Meetings Fruitlessly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded their week-long Spring
Meetings here today with little progress on plans for debt relief
and for avoiding financial emergencies.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the Development Committee and the joint
ministerial committee of the World Bank and IMF voiced their
support for the findings of the Task Force on Multilateral
Development Banks (MDBs), which was established in October 1994 to
assess the implications of globalization. The Ministers believed
the MDBs have a critical role to play in support of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
On ways to resolve debt problems of the heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCs), Ministers welcomed a Framework for Action
presented by the Bank and IMF management. Ministers agreed that
the principal goal of the proposed framework should be to ensure,
for these HIPC countries, that adjustment and reform efforts are
not put at risk by continued high debt and debt-service burdens.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee of the IMF issued a communique after its
meeting on Monday. The Committee, which is regarded as the
policy-making body for the international institution, welcomed the
establishment of the Special Data Dissemination Standard for
member nations having or seeking access to international capital
markets as a way of surveillance to the new global financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF committee also reiterated its support for continuation
of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), including
establishment of a self-sustained ESAF, as the centerpiece of the
IMF's strategy to help the low-income countries.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said no agreement was
reached on the key issue of expanding resources to deal with
future problems like the Mexican financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and IMF officials have proposed that the two
world lending organizations join with rich countries to reduce the
97 billion U.S. dollars owed by 20 of the poorest countries, most
of them in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to sell up to 5 percent, or 2 billion dollars of the
IMF's 40 billion dollars in gold, won some support at the
IMF-World Bank meetings, but no conclusion was reached.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest donor to both the World Bank
and IMF, but congressional rejection to approve proposed
contributions to international institutions has kept U.S. payments
below U.S. pledges.

<HEADLINE> Cook Islands Announces Measures to Avert Economic Ruin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey
Henry of Cook Islands has announced sweeping spending cuts in a
bid to save the Pacific Islands from the ongoing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Television New Zealand reported today that Sir Geoffrey
outlined an emergency plan last night aimed at heading off
economic ruin of the country.
</P>
<P>
The package included selling all state-owned enterprises,
halving the number of government departments and re-advertising
all state jobs and a short-term 50 percent pay cut for state
servants.
</P>
<P>
Sir Geoffrey said there was no alternative to the pay cuts
until the end of the current fiscal year ending June. But the cuts
would be repaid within two years.
</P>
<P>
The belt-tightening measures will also affect Cook Islands'
three representative offices abroad. Staff members in Auckland
will be cut and offices in Canberra and Sydney will be closed.
</P>
<P>
The Cook Islands, with an adult population of 10,000, now
reportedly  incurs a national debt of 100 million NZ dollars (68
million US dollars) and 25 million NZ dollars (17 million US
dollars) in defaulted loans, loan interest and money taken from
the workers' compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
The islands has asked New Zealand for financial help, but New
Zealand has turned down the request.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel to Fight on Despite Record Company Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, The Anglo-French
Channel tunnel operator, Monday unveiled losses of 925 million
pounds (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) for 1995, its first full year of
operation, one of the largest single-year deficits ever by a UK
company.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel has been in negotiations with its 225 banks since
September, when it suspended interest payments on 8.1 billion
pounds (12.2 billion US dollars) of debt after deciding that it
could not meet its interest payments from revenues for many years.
</P>
<P>
It said Monday that little progress had been made in the bank
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Erurotunnel, conceded that
there was no chance of Eurotunnel repaying its debt during the
56-year life of the operating concession.
</P>
<P>
But he said the company's financial performance was rapidly
improving, adding that Eurotunnel had grabbed almost half of the
cross-Channel market in its first year of operations and had made
it the market leader.
</P>
<P>
The company is forecasting an increase in turnover of at least
50 percent this year and costs are budgeted to be cut by 20
percent a year for three years.
</P>
<P>
An initiative to boost turnover further is expected to be
announced next month. This is likely to include a further
intensification of the price war against the ferries on duty-free
shopping at the tunnel terminals.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council on
Tuesday called upon states in the Great Lakes region to strictly
abide by the arms embargo against the former Rwandan government
troops.
</P>
<P>
It also asked them to ensure that their territory is not used
as a base for armed groups to launch incursions or attacks against
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The council took the action by unanimously adopting resolution
1053, which requested Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to
maintain the United Nations Commission of Inquiry charged with
monitoring the arms embargo against the former Rwandan government
forces.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the secretary-general to consult with states
neighbouring Rwanda, in particular Zaire, on appropriate measures,
including the possible deployment of United Nations observers, for
improving implementation of the arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
The council took the action at a report by the U.N. Commission
of Inquiry, which recommends the immediate establishment of a
mobile unit to monitor the embargo's implementation.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that governments of the region, particularly
Zaire, intensify their efforts to ensure that their
territory is not used for the recruitment or training of refugees,
nor as a base for armed groups to launch incursions against
another country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government and
Congress discussed today the budget of fiscal 1996 and reportedly
inched closer to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
A day before a stopgap spending authority for dozens of U.S.
agencies expires, top Republicans were exploring an offer from
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta aimed at resolving the
chief remaining hurdle to a compromise, the bill's environmental
language.
</P>
<P>
Republicans met with Panetta for 80 minutes behind closed doors
at the U.S. Capitol but it was unclear whether Republicans would
accept the idea.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to narrow our differences and made significant
progress in a number of areas," Panetta told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Though the 160 billion dollars measure's final shape was still
evolving, Republican leaders said they planned to bring it to the
House floor Wednesday. The bill would finance dozens of federal
agencies for the remaining five months of fiscal 1996, and end
what has become a lingering political headache for both parties.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the bargaining said the two sides had
tentatively agreed to add about 1 billion dollars that Clinton
wanted to the legislation, including extra money for the
environment. Final details on some of the funds are still being
worked out.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. departments and agencies are operating under stopgap
spending bills in the past seven months since the U.S. fiscal year
1996 started on October 1, 1996. The present temporary spending
bill, the 12th in the fiscal year, will expire on April 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The international High
Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt held talks today in Serb
stronghold Pale with Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic on future
political steps to change the present situation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Bildt told reporters the Council of Europe
will help local people living in difficult social conditions to
improve their life. Political problems cannot be more important
than reconstruction aid, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs had been under international sanctions until last
February 3.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said after the talks with Bildt that cooperation
between the Serbs and international institutions, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank would be
successful and that no more sanctions would be imposed against the
Serb entity -- the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic informed Bildt about the reasons behind the refusal of
Serb authority to take part in a recent donors' conference for the
reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"I asked the international community to treat the Serb entity
and the Muslim-Croat federation on an equal footing and to equally
invest in the reconstruction of both entities," he said.

NEW YORK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Shares on the New York Stock

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.85 to close at

stocks. The Dow has meandered aimlessly for the past few sessions,
while smaller company stocks have lifted other indexes to new

Advancing issues led decliners by about 9 to 7 on the NYSE,

</P>
<P>
Oil stocks rose with oil prices amid news the United States and
Britain have pushed the United Nations to toughen its negotiating
position with Iraq over a possible oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks benefited from the latest in a series of
encouraging earnings reports that suggest the industry is not as

Digital Equipment shares shot up after the computer maker said
its quarterly earnings rose 68 percent as the computer maker
posted strong sales increases in its storage and server lines.

<P>
Among other NYSE technology issues, Motorola, Compaq Computer

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Permanent Council of the
Organization of American States began a special session at its
headquarters here at noon today to discuss the situation in
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting was requested by Paraguay's mission to the

<HEADLINE> US Prepared Against Terrorism During Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal authorities
are stepping up activities to get prepared against possible
terrorist attacks during the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York and last
year's bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building have provoked
heightened concern about the possibility of some kind of terrorist
attack at the Olympics, The Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist use of poison gas in the Tokyo subway system
last year has sown unprecedented anxiety about threats from
unconventional weapons, it added.
</P>
<P>
During the 17-day event, the Atlanta city's population will be
doubled and about 40 heads of state are expected to come.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a task force under Vice President Al Core has been
set up to deal with possible terrorist attack. And a large
security force are being formed for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The force, more than doubling the 12,000 law enforcement
officers that protected the 1984 Olympics in Los Angles, will
consist of 3,000 Army troops, 6,300 National Guardsmen, and
10,000 other police and private security guards, with an
additional force of agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, the Post revealed.
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the worst, the FBI and other agencies are
holding secret exercises against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a three-day exercise was held in Atlanta against
terrorist nerve gas attack in the city and a plane hijacking at
the Atlanta airport.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Defense Nuclear Agency organized an exercise to
test its ability of dealing with a terrorist detonation of a
nuclear device near the city's center and another trill was
planned to deal with a germ-weapon attack.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal authorities will establish two
"explosive centers", where conventional bombs can be detonated or
defused.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these efforts has not been calculated, but the
Pentagon budget for supporting the Games is at least 47 million
dollars and an additional 25 million dollars has been committed
by the Georgia State on security, the paper noted.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Leader On Domestic Matters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- President of Mozambique's first
opposition party Renamo, Afonso Macachomaceta Dhlakama, expressed
his view here today on domestic problems such as "financial
crisis", military troops and local elections.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama told a news conference that all the opposition
parties are being faced with financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
His Resistencia Nacionae de Mocambique (Renamo) is striving to
set up small businesses to get out of the financial predicament,
he said, complaining that the government has placed blocks to its
businesses.
</P>
<P>
On the military issues, Dhlakama accused President Joaquin
Chissano, also Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, of
"sending all officers from Renamo abroad with an excuse that they
need studies."
</P>
<P>
The government wants to replace them with members from the
ruling Forcas Populares de Libertacao de Mosambique (FRELIMO),
according to Dhlakama.
</P>
<P>
But he stated that his party is still ready to take part in
the forthcoming local elections, adding that the Renamo hopes the
local elections will be held in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama disclosed that he may be able to meet President
Chissano late this month or early next month.

<HEADLINE> Botswanan Deploys Troops Near Namibia To Kill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has confirmed its
troops deployment near the disputed Kasikili Island, but
maintained it was part of an operation to destroy about 300,000
cattle infected with bovine lung sickness.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Foreign Affairs Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said that
Botswana's High Commissioner to Namibia, Rosemary Ditlhabi
Oliphant, had confirmed the deployment of soldiers, police and
anti-poaching units near the disputed island along the border,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, Oliphant claimed that the troop movements are
necessary as the government has decided to destroy infected
cattle.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Gurirab said Botswana military build-up near the
border was provocative, saying Namibia was not prepared to go to
war over the island.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Botswana government said it was
"regrettable" that the Namibian government, after being
officially informed, had not told its citizens about the reasons
for the troops movements.
</P>
<P>
Both Namibia and Botswana claim ownership of the small island
in the Chobe River separating north-eastern Namibia from
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Having failed to negotiate a settlement earlier this year,
Botswana and Namibia agreed to take the case to the International
Court of Justice at the Hague and committed themselves to abide
by the world court's ruling.
