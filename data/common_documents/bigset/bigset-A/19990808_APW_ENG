<HEADLINE> Race To Harvest Oranges by Machine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Little has changed over the past few  
hundred years in how oranges are picked. People climb up a ladder, 
handpick the fruit into bags and later dump them into bins. 
</P>
<P>
	All that may be about to change.  
</P>
<P>
	The race is on to develop a machine that can pick the fruit off  
of Florida's largest orange trees. Finding a mechanical harvester 
is a top priority for the Florida Department of Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers say the labor pool of human pickers is shrinking from  
the federal government's crackdown on illegal immigrants, costing 
the industry $54 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus officials worry that, without enough pickers, growers  
will be forced to leave oranges on trees. They also believe that 
mechanical harvesting will lower costs for Florida growers and keep 
them competitive with Brazil, the world's largest orange producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The citrus department has earmarked $2.5 million in next year's  
budget for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting a fruit harvester is priority No. 1,'' said Joseph  
Marshburn, a member of the Florida Citrus Commission, the governing 
board that sets policy in Florida's citrus industry. ``We want 
something that works, is fast and commercial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmworker advocates dispute growers' claims that there is a  
labor shortage and view efforts to develop a mechanical harvester 
as a way for growers to avoid paying competitive wages. 
</P>
<P>
	At least half of Florida's orange pickers are undocumented,  
illegal workers. Growers are unwilling to pay higher wages to 
career pickers, traditionally middle-aged black Americans, now that 
their source of cheap labor is drying up, said Greg Schell, an 
attorney for the Migrant Farmworkers Justice Project in Belle 
Glade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have determined it would be cheaper to use a mechanical  
harvester,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanical harvesting is just in its infancy. But some citrus  
officials believe 75 percent of Florida's processed orange crop 
could be harvested by machine in 10 years. That is a considerable 
portion of the Florida orange crop considering almost all of the 
state's oranges are processed, or used for juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Oranges are the state's biggest crop, representing $1.1 billion  
of Florida's $6.2 billion in agricultural cash receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	A mechanical harvester would only be used on oranges headed for  
the juice processor. Oranges intended for table fruit would still 
be picked by hand to prevent bruising. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, mechanical harvesters would likely only be  
used in Florida. Most of the oranges produced in Arizona, 
California and Texas are sold as table fruit. Grapefruit would 
still be picked by hand since most of Florida's grapefruit crop is 
used as table fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	For years farmers have used mechanical harvesters for crops such  
as cherries, olives and apples. But oranges have proved tougher to 
pick by machine because their stems are thicker than other fruit, 
said Galen Brown, the state citrus department's harvesting program 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Six types of mechanical harvesters are being developed under the  
aegis of the citrus department. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only one type, known as the ``trunk, shake and catch''  
model, is available for commercial use. This past season those 
machines were used to harvest only 5,000 acres of Florida's 658,000 
acres of orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trunk, shake and catch'' machines comes in two parts. On  
one side of a tree, a mechanical ``shaker'' on wheels grasps the 
trunk of the tree with two rubber donut-like hands and shakes the 
tree. On the other side is a long, mobile conveyor belt that 
catches the oranges and moves them into a bin. The bin is 
periodically dumped into a large truck. The shaker and catcher move 
along a grove row in tandem. The machines can only be used on trees 
with trunks 18 inches or larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Other mechanical harvesters being developed look like something  
from a sci-fi movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``canopy area shake and catch'' model, from afar, looks like  
toothbrush bristles attached to a crane. The ``continuous travel 
canopy shake and catch'' model has porcupine-like spikes that move 
through trees like a paint rollerbrush. 
</P>
<P>
	A few growers that have decided to try mechanical harvesting are  
taking a wait-and-see attitude and are leasing instead of buying 
the machines, which can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The various machines under development will reduce a grower's  
harvesting costs anywhere from 10 percent to 75 percent and are 
three to four times more productive than handpickers, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton Enterprises, the Chico, Calif.-based manufacturer which  
developed one of the ``trunk, shake and catch'' models, estimates 
that harvesting costs using a standard crew of 20 to 30 men can 
reach up to $558 per acre. Mechanical harvesting, which requires 
only three operators, would cost $248 an acre, according to the 
company's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers in other countries, most notably France, Italy,  
Israel and Spain, have tried developing mechanical citrus 
harvesters but with little success. Brazil, Florida's main 
competitor for orange production, is looking to the Sunshine State 
to see how mechanical harvesting fares, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does succeed, it could be the biggest change to orange  
picking in Florida since the Spanish began harvesting the fruit in 
the 16th century, said John Attaway, a retired University of 
Florida professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be the first change. Period,'' said Attaway, who  
also is former director of scientific research at the citrus 
department. ``We've always picked it by hand.''

<HEADLINE> Facts About Oil Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of the case alleging unfair trade practices involving  
oil imports: 

</P>
<P>
	PETITION: Filed by about a dozen small independent oil producers  
organized under an Okahoma-based coalition called Save Domestic Oil 
Inc. Petition is supported by many other independents, but opposed 
by the major international oil companies. 

</P>
<P>
	CHARGES: That government-oil companies in Venezuela, Mexico,  
Saudi Arabia and Iraq sold oil in the U.S. market at ``less than 
normal value'' and that the government's subsidized such sales, to 
the economic detriment of the U.S. industry. These countries 
account for 60 percent of U.S. oil imports. 

</P>
<P>
	THE LAW: The anti-dumping laws enacted in 1930 prohibit selling  
imported products at lower prices than they are sold in home 
countries or below average cost of production, and prohibit 
governments from subsidizing production or export of such products. 

</P>
<P>
	PROCEDURES: Jurisdiction is divided between the Commerce  
Department's International Trade Association, and an independent 
agency, the International Trade Commission (ITC). 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is filed with Commerce, which decides if the group  
has legal standing, whether the product is being sold in violation 
of the law, and whether an action should be initiated. 
</P>
<P>
	If the case is accepted, the independent ITC then must decides  
whether the U.S. industry, or the portion of the industry subject 
to the petition, has been harmed economically as a result. The 
Commerce agency then decides what tariffs or penalties should be 
imposed. 

</P>
<P>
	APPEALS: If Commerce decides initially to reject the case,  
petitioners may appeal to the Court of International Trade, a 
process that can take several years.

<HEADLINE> New Browns Prepare for 'First Game' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Never has an exhibition game meant so much.  
</P>
<P>
	To the NFL, Monday night's Hall of Fame Game is the fulfillment  
of a promise kept. 
</P>
<P>
	To Cleveland, it's the return of pro football and a way of life.  
</P>
<P>
	And to Browns fans, it's a chance to bark, scream and cheer  
their beloved team again. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-year absence, the Cleveland Browns are being  
reborn, in of all places, football's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Following pregame ceremonies which will include past Cleveland  
greats, and with a national TV audience looking on, the new Browns 
will take the field in their familiar orange helmets to play the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	When the moment arrives, Fawcett Stadium, packed with Browns  
fans and complete with its own Dawg Pound, will erupt with a roar 
that may be heard clear to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns will be back, and for many it will seem like a dream  
come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is going to have to pinch me,'' said team president  
Carmen Policy. ``And then I'm going to have to pinch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's fans haven't seen their team play since December  
1995, and this year's Hall of Fame Game was switched from its 
traditional Saturday slot to Monday in prime time by the league in 
order to showcase the Browns' return as the first expansion team in 
history with a history. 
</P>
<P>
	The game will cap an unforgettable football weekend in Northeast  
Ohio. On Saturday, former Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome was 
enshrined in the Hall of Fame along with Tom Mack, Eric Dickerson, 
Billy Shaw and Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to go down there and be able to play as a local team in  
that whole setting, coming back new ...,'' said Browns coach Chris 
Palmer, who will be making his debut as an NFL head coach. ``I 
won't be the only one with butterflies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Browns were awarded a new franchise after former owner  
Art Modell took his team to Baltimore in 1996, the NFL agreed 
Cleveland could keep its nickname, colors, uniforms and statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	It also allowed Browns to keep alive their memories of one of  
the most storied franchises in American sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Even America's team is caught up in the excitement.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time thinking the Cleveland Browns are new,''  
said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who became familiar with the Browns 
and their tradition while an assistant coach in Pittsburgh. ``That 
doesn't sound right. It seems like there ought to be some special 
name or exotic name for an expansion team. I'm struggling with them 
being a new team. They've got the same fans, I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's new football era will also begin the Tim Couch Era  
with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie quarterback, taken No. 1 overall by the Browns in  
April's NFL draft, will make his pro debut midway through the first 
quarter, replacing Ty Detmer, who will run the Browns this season 
until Palmer and his staff think Couch is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch has been pointing to this game his entire life, and  
outwardly he doesn't appear to be nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played in the SEC and we played in the big game week-in and  
week-out,'' he said. ``I'll probably forget it's on TV once we get 
out there and and start playing football again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who has been tinkering with Couch's mechanics since  
training camp opened, has been impressed with his young QB's 
progress. He has seen the gap between his starter and backup 
tighten. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty Detmer is ahead of Tim, but Tim has a better grasp of  
what's going on now and what defenses are doing to him,'' Palmer 
said. ``Tim is getting to the point where he can compete on the 
same plane, and then it will come down to performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer has had just seven months to put together a staff,  
assemble a team and have it ready by Monday. It's too early to 
worry about final scores yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning takes care of itself,'' he said. ``All I'm looking for  
is improvement with my players, that we're getting better from week 
to week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's game will be a homecoming for Cleveland linebacker  
Chris Spielman, who, in a way, seemed destined to play for the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Canton, Spielman grew up within walking distance of the  
Hall and said he visited the museum 15 times a year. He missed the 
past two seasons, 1997 with a neck injury and last year to be with 
his wife, Stephanie, as she recovered from breast cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's humbling,'' he said of restarting his career in his  
hometown. ``But I'm just one guy. It's nice, but it's not about 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, it's all about the Browns.

<HEADLINE> Harry `The Hat' Walker Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Harry ``The Hat'' Walker, who led the  
National League in hitting for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1947, 
died Sunday from complications of a stroke. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker had been hospitalized since July 16, University Hospital  
spokesman Hank Black said. Funeral arrangements were incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, a left-handed hitter nicknamed for his habit of  
adjusting his cap between pitches, had a .296 average in a 22-year 
pro career, including 11 seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent eight years with the Cardinals and also played for the  
Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds, mostly as 
an outfielder. He appeared in three World Series (1942, 1943 and 
1946) and two All-Star Games (1943 and 1947). 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's best year was in 1947, when he batted .363 while  
playing 130 games for Philadelphia and 10 games with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 20 years as a manager, including major league stints  
with the Cardinals (1955), Pittsburgh Pirates (1965-67) and Houston 
Astros (1968-72). For the next six years, he worked in various 
capacities for the Cardinals' organization, including hitting 
coach, minor league farm director and scout. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker then came to Alabama-Birmingham, where he became the  
first head coach for the baseball program, from 1979-1986. He led 
the Blazers to Sun Belt Conference North Division titles in 1981-82 
and had an eight-year record of 211-171. Walker finished his UAB 
career with four consecutive 20-plus victory seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born Nov. 22, 1916, in Pascagoula, Miss., the son of the  
first Alabamian to go to the majors -- Ewart ``Dixie'' Walker, who 
pitched for Washington in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Walker's uncle, Ernie Walker, played for the St. Louis  
Browns, and brother Fred ``Dixie'' Walker was a star outfielder in 
the NL and AL.

<HEADLINE> Hugh Quarshie at Gen Con Game Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Captain Panaka took time out from fighting the  
Phantom Menace to sign autographs at the 1999 Gen Con Game Fair, a 
convention for science fiction and fantasy game fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Panaka actually is Hugh Quarshie, who played the head of  
Naboo's Royal Security Forces in the George Lucas film ``Star Wars: 
Episode One -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The character had to protect Queen Amidala from the likes of  
such villains as Darth Maul and Rune Haako in the film. Quarshie 
said he enjoyed being ``part of somebody's dreamscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Ghana but raised in England, Quarshie acted in the Royal  
Shakespeare Company, along with television and movies, before he 
signed on with the 'Star Wars' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say I was quite pleased,'' Quarshie said Sunday. ``I  
was elated, of course. It's a kind of a rare opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarshie called the Star Wars movies ``a modern legend'' that  
has entered into the subconscious of millions of people. He said 
he's not surprised by all the hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been this long wait for the next 'Star Wars,'''  
Quarshie said. ``It's not quite on the level of the second coming -- 
I suppose it is for some people.''

<HEADLINE> Crew 2, Wizards 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ansil Elcock scored in the 70th minute  
Sunday to give the Columbus Crew a 2-1 MLS victory over the Kansas 
City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	Elcock's third goal of the season, assisted on by Brian  
Maisonneuve and Brian McBride, improved the Crew's record to 14-7 
and gave them 32 points, moving second-place Columbus within two 
points of first-place D.C. United in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride took the ball from two Kansas City defenders and passed  
it to Maisonneuve around midfield. He sent it to Elcock, who shot 
from 15 yards out and beat Kansas City goalkeeper David Winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew's Robert Warzycha opened the scoring with his first  
goal of the season in the 22nd minute. The ball caromed off Kansas 
City defender Alexi Lalas, hit the goal post and went in. Brian 
West and Maisonneuve got assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Brown of Kansas City (6-16) made the score 1-1 in the 55th  
minute on a low shot from 25 yards out that also hit the post and 
eluded Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty. The goal was Brown's fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew had a 15-12 edge in shots. Winner made five saves and  
Dougherty had three. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City played the last 11 minutes with 10 players after  
defender Uche Okafor was ejected for tackling from behind.

<HEADLINE> Boggs' 3,000th Caps Historic Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs was still glowing.  
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the 3,000-hit club strolled into the Tampa  
Bay Devil Rays clubhouse Sunday morning, eager to get on with the 
rest of a career he has no plans to end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He's 41 and no longer contending for batting titles, however the  
home run he hit Saturday night for his greatest individual 
accomplishment raised his average to .297. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs doubled for No. 3,001 in his only at-bat Sunday before  
taking the rest of the day off against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said 3,000 hits is not a termination point in my  
career,'' he said, adding that he hasn't given a lot of thought to 
how much longer he'd like to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to rip the shirt off of me. If I'm  
hitting .300 and still performing, and the game's still fun, I'll 
continue to play if they'll have me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic hit, on a 2-2 pitch from Chris Haney in the sixth  
inning of a 15-10 loss to the Indians, capped a remarkable 
three-day run of baseball history. And it was perhaps fitting that 
hit No. 3,000 was a home run, only the second of the season for 
Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire began the three-day stretch Thursday night in St.  
Louis by becoming only the 16th player to hit 500 career home runs. 
McGwire, who set the single-season mark of 70 last year, added No. 
501 later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Tony Gwynn, who broke into the major leagues three  
months after Boggs, got his 3,000th hit, lining a single in the 
first inning in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Saturday and Boggs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Three milestones in three nights, that's pretty amazing,''  
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball history, the closest two hitters have reached such  
milestones was in 1970 when Ernie Banks slugged his 500th home run 
on May 12 and Hank Aaron got his 3,000th hit five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, Eddie Collins got his 3,000th hit 17 days after Tris  
Speaker had passed the milestone, until now the closest two players 
had reached that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken could become the third player to reach 3,000 this  
season. The Baltimore star, currently on the disabled list, needs 
32 hits to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just as McGwire added homer No. 501 before his game ended,  
Gwynn used his 3,000th hit as the beginning of another multi-hit 
contest. The San Diego right fielder collected four hits and left 
the game in the eighth inning with a career total of 3,003. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's big home run came against the Padres. And before Gwynn  
left St. Louis, McGwire made sure to collect a souvenir for his 
son, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Gwynn and I swapped jerseys,'' he said. ``I don't get  
anything for myself. I do everything for Matt. So I had him sign 
it, `To Matt.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs put a special stamp on his moment, too, becoming the first  
player to homer for No. 3,000. He capped an emotional trip around 
the bases by getting down on his knees and kissing home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people got caught up in the moment as Boggs stood in  
for the big at-bat. While the fans gave him a huge ovation, the 
public-address announcer forgot to call Boggs' name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had always said this is not a race. That if it was a race,  
then it would have meant something more special,'' Boggs said, 
alluding to the attention he and Gwynn received pursuing the 
milestone at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now to do something no one else has ever done, that's  
special. If I had just gotten a little bloop hit or something like 
that, I would have just been Wade Boggs, the singles hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs spent the first 11 seasons of his career with the Boston  
Red Sox and the next five with the New York Yankees. The 
opportunity to chase 3,000 before family and lifelong friends is 
one of the reasons he signed with the expansion Devil Rays last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropicana Field is about 20 miles from where he grew up and  
played Little League ball in Tampa, and the crowd of 39,512 that 
witnessed history included his father, wife and 12-year-old son, 
Brett. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs said the moment was more than the realization of a dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a thousand times more. You couldn't imagine. When  
you're running around the bases, you're not even touching the 
ground. You're just floating around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth, I thought I was going to sit down there  
and start crying like a baby. I shed a couple of tears when I 
hugged my father, but I was happy more than anything ... It was 
just a fantastic moment. It really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs went home to celebrate and watch highlights of the game  
with 50 to 60 close friends and family members. Tampa mayor Dick 
Greco, a neighbor, showed up at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had tickets for (Sunday),'' Boggs said. ``I said: `Sorry,  
mayor. I did it last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-time All-Star walked into the clubhouse seven hours  
later, carrying a bat and a new pair of shoes to replace the ones 
he used on the most memorable night of an 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a blast. Just the amount of adrenaline that's still  
in my body. I couldn't wait to wake up this morning and come to the 
ball park,'' Boggs said, conceding a tremendous burden had been 
lifted off his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	A superstitious person who joked that he may now change a  
well-known pregame routine that includes a meal with chicken, Boggs 
had worried that an injury or accident might prevent him from 
reaching 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept thinking about Roberto Clemente, who reached the  
milestone on the last day of the 1972 season and died in a plane 
crash that winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you get there,'' Boggs said, ``until you really seize  
the moment, everything is a panic attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays hold an option on his contract for 2000 and have  
yet to talk to him about next year. One thing Boggs knows is he's 
not ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some great names to pass,'' he said. ``You look at  
the list and it's phenomenal. They are some of the greatest players 
to ever play this game, and I'm so fortunate to be in the same 
breath with those guys.''

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A ninth Cuban left the team's  
delegation at the Pan American Games, saying Saturday he planned to 
seek asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball player Juan Leopoldo Vazquez defected before a  
morning game. He turned up elsewhere in Winnipeg accompanied by 
Ninoska Perez, director of the Cuban American National Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez would be the ninth member of the Cuban delegation to  
leave, and the seventh athlete. Last month, five members of Cuba's 
national basketball team defected while in Puerto Rico for the 
Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	American swimmers finished strongly, getting golds from Denali  
Knapp in the women's 200-meter backstroke, from Timothy Siciliano 
in the men's 1,500 freestyle, and from Tammie Spatz in the women's 
50 freestyle. It was not enough, however, to avoid the worst 
showing in Pan Ams history. 
</P>
<P>
	In 32 events, the Americans won only 10 gold medals, seven by  
the women. Not since 1963, when there were only eight events for 
men and eight for women, had either of the U.S. teams won fewer 
than 10 golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada won nine women's events. Jessica Daglau became the first  
Canadian to win four golds, taking the women's 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Curtis Myden, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in the  
200 individual medley, won his specialty. Earlier, he won the 400 
IM. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil capped the meet by winning the men's 400 medley relay.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba beat Canada 72-63 for women's basketball gold. Cuba's Licet  
Castillo, who played the entire tournament on a bad left knee, led 
all scorers with 20 points. Kelly Boucher had 17 points and 10 
rebounds for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	With a history of medals staring at them, the U.S. women came  
through in basketball. They won the bronze with an impressive 85-59 
victory over Brazil, which defeated the Americans in preliminary 
play. The United States continued its streak of earning a medal in 
women's basketball in every Pan Ams since the sport was added in 
1955. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them about that before the game,'' coach Nell Fortner  
said. ``I said if we don't win, we're the only USA team that goes 
home without a medal in the Pan Am Games. They need to know things 
like that. I think that served as extra motivation and they came 
out and played hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Herrig, making some slick moves inside, scored 16 of her 18  
points in the first half. Edwina Brown took it from there, scoring 
13 of her 19 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game that we've had a lead, whether it be two points,  
three points, 15 or 16 points, we kind of lost it in the first five 
minutes,'' Brown said. ``So we wanted to target the first five 
minutes of the second half and just give it everything we had. We 
weren't going to let them on a run and we weren't going to be 
beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was Janette Piesczynski, who won the women's bowling  
gold medal by a mere one pin, giving the United States its third 
title in the sport. Piesczynski, of Cheektowaga, N.Y., beat Alicia 
Marcano of Venezuela 216-205 in the 16th and last match. That was 
enough -- barely -- to beat Marcano 3,328 to 3,327 for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I checked the scores after every match today,'' she said. ``I  
said I wouldn't, but I wanted to know where I stood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Piesczynski got two strikes in the final frame, Marcano  
needed to strike out in the 10th for a tie. She got the first two, 
but left the 7 pin standing on her last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the U.S. men and women won the team events earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	In two tight softball games against Canada, the American women  
won the gold 1-0 in eight innings, and the men lost a controversial 
4-3 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Fernandez singled in Dot Richardson in the eighth and  
Michele Smith pitched a two-hitter as the U.S. women finished 12-0. 
They oustscored opponents 83-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men weren't so fortunate, as Canada won its sixth  
straight Pan Ams gold. Kevin Bobroske's infield single off pitcher 
Michael White's glove with the bases loaded and two out won it. But 
the inning was extended when U.S. first baseman Shawn Rychcik was 
ruled off the bag on a routine groundout; replays clearly showed he 
was touching the base, and the Americans argued to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd rather see a base hit straight off the bat or a home  
run,'' Rychcik said. ``Lose that way and you always have doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the medals race, the United States is far ahead with 285, 102  
gold. Canada is at 186, 59 gold. Cuba has 153, 71 gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Barnett, chosen by Team USA captains to carry the flag for  
Sunday's closing ceremony, won a bronze in the 105-kilogram 
weightlifting class. It was not what Barnett, of St. Joseph, Mo., 
had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed,'' he said after Ecuador's Boris Burov  
won the gold and Cuba's Michel Batista De Moya took the silver. ``I 
certainly didn't come here for a bronze medal. I really came in 
looking to do some big things, but I was sluggish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Narvaez of Argentina beat Jose Navarro of Los Angeles 10-1  
for the flyweight gold medal in boxing. Later, super heavyweight 
Davin King of Temple Hills, Md., forfeited his fight because he had 
two stitches in his upper lip, which he received in the semifinals. 
He got a silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The hosts surprised the highly ranked United States synchronized  
swimming team for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canada sold their routine a little bit better than we did,''  
coach Chris Carver said. ``Our execution was better. Our routine is 
better. Canada had a little more soul, a little more energy than us 
today. That will be corrected.''

<HEADLINE> Six Injured in Water Park Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AGAWAM, Mass. (AP) -- Two people remained hospitalized in  
critical condition Sunday following a weekend amusement park 
accident that left them trapped beneath a flipped raft. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of six people -- a family of four and their two friends --  
were hurt in the accident Saturday night on Riverside Park's 
Blizzard River ride. Hospital officials said injuries ranged from 
``bumps and bruises to near drowning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously hurt were John Pascone of Dayville, Conn.,  
and Susan Messier, 27, of Coventry, R.I. Both were listed in 
critical condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials said the fiberglass-and-rubber raft carrying the  
two families overturned about 50 feet from the ride's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The six were apparently belted into the raft at the time, and  
may have been trapped face-down in about 2 1/2 feet of water. Other 
rafts were nearby when the accident happened, but it was not 
immediately clear if they struck the overturned raft or its 
occupants, park spokesman Ron Sevart said. 
</P>
<P>
	A ride operator witnessed the accident and help arrived within a  
minute, Sevart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a woman was killed and 10 people were injured when a  
raft flipped on a ride at Six Flags Over Texas. Both Riverside and 
Six Flags are owned by the same Oklahoma City-based company, 
Premier Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Terrie Ward said the rides were constructed by  
different manufacturers and there have been no other similar 
accidents at other Premier-owned parks.

<HEADLINE> Kendra Says Faith Helped Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- With tears rolling down his cheeks,  
Florida State fifth-year senior Dan Kendra said Sunday that he 
discovered the power of faith watching a religious television show 
last month and that it is helping him recover from a 
career-threatening knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like all my worries have been lifted,'' said Kendra,  
one of the most celebrated athletes to be recruited by the 
university. ``I put all my effort, everything, into my body, my 
lifting, my strength, my eating. And I knew that wasn't the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendra, 23, suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his  
right knee April 4, 1998 during the school's annual Garnet &AMP; Gold 
scrimmage when he was tackled by linebacker Bradley Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was putting so much emphasis into my body and that when this  
happened I really had nowhere to turn,'' he said. ``My body 
deceived me. It was like my God deceived me and I was just lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the backup quarterback to Thad Busby in 1996 and 1997, Kendra  
passed for 1,006 yards and 12 touchdowns. He was one of the 
nation's most heralded prep players coming out of school from 
Bethlehem, Pa., in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	After beginning the rehabilitation process a year ago, Kendra  
asked Florida State coaches to move him to fullback. But his right 
knee continued to threaten his playing time at any position as he 
trained for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like God would say, OK he's had enough, let's  
get him out of this,'' Kendra said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like as my spirit has gotten better, my knee has gotten  
better,'' Kendra said. ``I feel like I'll be ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circled by two dozen reporters during Florida State's annual  
media day activities, the 260-pound Kendra was answering questions 
about his health, the position change and rehabilitation when his 
voice broke and he shared his recent experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching a show July 23 called ``Signs from God,'' Kendra saw  
himself as being obsessed with things that he said shouldn't make 
any difference to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football was my God,'' Kendra said. ``Achieving success,  
achieving money was my God. All those things that can go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendra said he prayed to have his injured knee healed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me something so much better, he healed my heart and my  
mind,'' Kendra said. ``Now I found the truth about life was all 
about,'' Kendra said. ``God calls you to be faithful, he doesn't 
call you to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so thankful he got me at 23 years old,'' Kendra said.  
``It's almost like somebody came up to you and said, how would you 
like to have all your worries, all your fears, lifted from you for 
the rest of your life?''

<HEADLINE> 6 Russians Found Alive in Bering Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE (AP) -- Six Russian boaters whose skiffs became  
separated from their companions while crossing the Bering Sea were 
found in good condition after being lost for four days, the Coast 
Guard said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The boaters had become separated from a larger group while  
making a 65-mile Bering Strait crossing from St. Lawrence Island 
off Alaska's west coast to Provideniya on Russia's Chukotka 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard plane spotted four people in two skiffs on  
Saturday, about 30 miles east of Provideniya, said Coast Guard Lt. 
Cmdr. Brian Flory. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, two others in a third skiff were spotted by  
a Russian freighter. 
</P>
<P>
	All were hungry and thirsty, but did not appear to be seriously  
injured, Flory said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six were part of a group of 37 people, mainly Siberian  
Eskimos, who had set out Tuesday in 14 skiffs. They were making the 
six-hour crossing loaded with supplies and gifts from relatives and 
friends in Gambell. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents of Russia's Chukotka Peninsula share the same  
Siberian Yupik Eskimo ancestry and language with residents of St. 
Lawrence Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The flotilla ran into rough seas during the crossing. Two people  
-- a father and son -- drowned when their skiff sank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had launched an intensive airborne search for  
three missing skiffs late Tuesday night. The search was called off 
Friday, but resumed Saturday after the Coast Guard received 
permission from Russian authorities to search on the Russian side 
of the maritime boundary. 
</P>
<P>
	A C-130 transport plane was able to drop a radio, food, gasoline  
and supplies to four people in two boats Saturday. They were taken 
aboard a Russian freighter bound for Provideniya and were joined by 
the other two people when they were found soon after.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Tests New, High-Speed Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) -- Even at a standstill, the silver,  
bullet-nosed train looks out of place on this remote, brush-covered 
prairie, where the horizon is broken only by the far-off silhouette 
of Pikes Peak and an occasional antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	And when it moves, under the close watch of a group of  
engineers, it becomes a gray streak flashing through the landscape 
of sagebrush and sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually it will go 150 mph, making it the fastest train in  
the country. And that's not even its top speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had it up to 167 mph a couple weeks ago,'' Ernie Chance,  
Amtrak's assistant chief mechanic officer, said from inside the 
engineer's quarters. ``And it felt like she still had more power in 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She'' is one of 20 high-speed electric trains named Acelas  
that Amtrak is having built as part of a $2 billion project. The 
Acelas, unveiled in March, will be used along routes connecting 
Boston, New York and Washington, with the first passenger runs 
scheduled for November or December. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new trains is being tested for up to 16 hours a day  
on a 13-mile track at the Transportation Technology Center, which 
sprawls across 52 square miles of land about 25 miles northeast of 
Pueblo. The center is a subsidiary of the Association of American 
Railroads, representing North American freight railroads and 
Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remote and we can do a lot of testing with relative  
secrecy,'' said Keith Hawthorne, the center's vice president of 
technology. ``Our customers like that; they want to be able to iron 
out their problems in private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Acelas are designed to tilt gently as the trains rush around  
curves. That doesn't promote speed as much as it prevents 
centrifugal force from throwing the passengers around. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the tilt mechanism deactivated for a test run at a  
mere 110 mph, the ride on the special test track is much smoother 
and freer of vibration than Amtrak's existing Metroliner service in 
the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no need to grab the seats for balance while walking down  
the train's aisle. Filling in a New York Times crossword puzzle is 
easy -- if you know the answers -- and the quiet ride makes 
conversation easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bistro car will have standup tables with pedestal seating  
like a bar,'' said Chance. ``With this ride, especially with the 
tilt-system on, it should be as comfortable for people to stand up 
as it is to sit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cars of the train that is being tested have been transformed  
into traveling laboratories, filled with computers, printers and 
miles of cable. A dozen engineers perform tests on the train's 
propulsion, endurance, acceleration, energy consumption, wheel wear 
and ride quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day we have a problem that we fix the next day,'' said  
Gilles Losier, the supervisor of quality assurance and testing for 
Bombardier Inc., the train's Montreal-based manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The most difficult problem encountered so far occurred when the  
wheel sets began shaking from side to side at speeds of 130 mph to 
145 mph. The wheels, a French design, were reshaped to fit more 
closely with the American-made track. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, old tracks on the Washington-New York line will limit  
the Acelas to 135 mph, Chance said. That is 10 mph faster than the 
Metroliners run now, and will slice 16 minutes off the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tracks are reconfigured, the trains will be able to  
run at 150 mph, cutting an additional 13 minutes off the trip, said 
John Wolf, an Amtrak spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-Boston leg will require new overhead electrical  
wires in addition to track improvements. Wolf says Amtrak hopes to 
trim that trip from 4 1/2 hours to three hours.

<HEADLINE> Bears, Colts See Room To Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Good thing this one didn't count.  
</P>
<P>
	While the Chicago Bears won their first exhibition game in  
almost two years Saturday night, the 9-6 victory over the 
Indianapolis Colts was more like an exercise in ugliness. For both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 500 yards in total offense. No touchdowns. Eighteen  
penalties totaling 134 yards. Anemic passing game. Running game, 
what running game? 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't real pretty,'' new Bears coach Dick Jauron said.  
</P>
<P>
	Granted, it was the first game of the preseason. But both of  
these teams were awful last year, and the regular season is just a 
few weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Peyton Manning looked more like the quarterback who struggled at  
the start of last season than the one who finished with all kinds 
of NFL rookie records. He went three-and-out on three of his five 
series, and finished 6-of-11 for 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was intercepted on his third series when Tom Carter,  
playing in his first game since breaking his collarbone last 
September, read his long pass to E.G. Green perfectly, stepping in 
front of the receiver and snatching the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like any first game of the year. We couldn't put two  
plays in a row together,'' Manning said. ``You'd like to go down 
the field bam-bam-bam. But we made some mistakes. It's a sign of 
growing. They missed some passes, but I missed some throws, as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Colts' offense didn't fare much better. Though  
backup Kelly Holcomb led Indianapolis' two drives that resulted in 
field goals, he was just 5-of-15 for 60 yards. Marvin Harrison had 
three catches for 34 yards, but Green caught two balls for nine 
yards and Jerome Pathon had 17 yards on two catches. 
</P>
<P>
	And the running game? Without No. 4 pick Edgerrin James, who's  
still a holdout, the Colts' leading rusher was Holcomb, who picked 
up 27 yards on three scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty much a typical preseason game. Too many  
mistakes, but we'll correct them,'' coach Jim Mora said. ``I 
thought we protected the quarterback pretty well, especially early 
in the game. We didn't run the ball very well. We didn't make many 
big plays on offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts' defense was solid, putting a lot of pressure on  
Chicago's quarterbacks. Indianapolis had three sacks, including a 
double-team on Cade McNown by Jason Chorak and Brad Scioli that 
cost the Bears nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some guy welcomed me to the NFL,'' McNown, who's been  
in camp four days, said of the trash talk he heard. ``But I 
reminded him it was the preseason, so he wasn't allowed to welcome 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown was only supposed to play one or two series at the start  
of the second half, but those were so forgettable -- three-and-out 
in a hurry on both -- Jauron gave him another chance. It ended up 
being one of the highlights of the game as McNown led an 
eight-play, 56-yard drive that resulted in Todd Sauerbrun's 
game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	While McNown didn't get the Bears to the end zone, he had a nice  
21-yard pass and two seemingly effortless bullets that resulted in 
pass interference calls against the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes things happen,'' Jauron said. ``He did it in college  
and that's what we expected of him and that's what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauerbrun, who filled in at placekicker for the injured Jeff  
Jaeger, kicked two other field goals, including the 31-yard 
game-winner with 6:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to get back into it and get back into a groove  
again,'' said Sauerbrun, who tore ligaments in his knee in the 
third game last year and missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' pass rush showed it still needs some work, but their  
biggest problem was penalties. It started with two flags on the 
first play of the game. Then, after Carter's interception gave 
Chicago the ball at its own 41, consecutive false starts by Greg 
Huntington and Marcus Robinson killed the drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington also had two false starts on McNown's third series.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said earlier it wasn't pretty,'' McNown said. ``But at least  
we won.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Mag Group Cahners Plans Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Cahners Business Information is planning to  
lay off 300 employees, or about 7 percent of its work force, and 
may move its headquarters to New York as part of a reorganization 
intended to improve profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cahners, a subsidiary of the British-Dutch media giant Reed  
Elsevier PLC, publishes Variety and 127 other trade publications as 
well as more than 140 Web sites. The Newton-based company has more 
than 4,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a broad, cost-cutting strategy announced last week,  
Cahners is planning to consolidate its real estate holdings, which 
stretch as far west as Denver and include offices in Chicago, New 
York, Philadelphia and Radnor, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very expensive to have so many different locations,''  
said Margaret Pantridge, a Cahners spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Cahners chief executive officer, Bruce Barnet, plans to move his  
office to New York, but the company is reviewing other locations 
for its headquarters, Pantridge told The Boston Globe. 
</P>

	The company's revenues dropped by 2 percent in the first six  
months of 1999, to $442 million, compared to the same period the 
previous year.

	Paul Richardson, senior vice president of Reed Elsevier, blamed  
the revenue decline on turmoil -- largely due to the Asian financial 
crisis -- that has hit some of Cahners' biggest advertisers, 
particularly in the manufacturing and semiconductor industries.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Case Summaries Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next important step in the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. happens early this week when 
the judge receives hundreds of pages of documents largely 
summarizing months of courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the sides to  
present by Tuesday their versions of the facts of the case, one of 
the final steps toward a possible verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who planned an unorthodox appearance in Atlanta on  
Monday at a panel discussion with lawyers for Microsoft and the 
government, could decide the case late this year or early in 2000 -- 
unless off-and-on settlement negotiations succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began last October, the sides have met several  
times outside the courtroom, including once in early June. Future 
talks are anticipated this summer, but outside legal experts 
consider settlement unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust case, which accuses Microsoft of illegally  
wielding monopoly power in the software industry to crush potential 
rivals, has been on hiatus for seven weeks, since courtroom 
testimony ended June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said its court filing this week will focus on what it  
considers the government's failure to prove that the company's 
actions hurt customers, which would be necessary to support a 
guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The company apparently hopes to capitalize on a potentially  
embarrassing slip by government witness Franklin Fisher, an 
economist. Fisher told Justice lawyer David Boies in January that 
Microsoft's behavior ``on balance'' hasn't harmed consumers ``up to 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher caught himself moments later and amended his answer to  
explain that he believed consumers eventually would feel an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft strongly disagrees, said a company lawyer who outlined  
arguments in Microsoft's court filing on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, Microsoft will reassert that it's not an entrenched  
monopolist in the fast-paced technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It will argue it didn't illegally discourage the nation's  
largest computer makers and Internet providers from distributing 
Web-browsing software manufactured by rival Netscape Communications 
Corp., recently bought by America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The government improperly focused on a few manufacturers of  
computer operating-system software to illustrate Microsoft's 
dominance, the company contends. Proving a company wields monopoly 
power is essential to winning an antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft said it will argue it doesn't charge prices as  
high as a monopolist would, and its massive spneding on research 
and development of new software ``makes no sense if Microsoft had 
durable monopoly power,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants the judge to consider an array of fledgling  
technologies as its competition -- including new types of software 
and devices developed by America Online and others. It hopes to 
show that even though its flagship Windows software runs most of 
the world's personal computers, Microsoft's future influence is far 
from certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In another of its arguments, Microsoft will challenge the  
government's allegation that it included browsing software free in 
Windows in 1995 to undermine Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers, citing e-mails, contend Microsoft spent  
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop its Internet software 
but gave it away only after Netscape emerged as a threat to Windows 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's lawsuit quotes Microsoft's senior vice  
president, Paul Maritz, saying: ``We are going to cut off 
(Netscape's) air supply. Everything they're selling, we're going to 
give away for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz denied making the comment, and on Sunday, The New Yorker  
reported, in its edition on newsstands Monday, Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates' reaction to the alleged quotation: 
</P>
<P>
	``A great lie! An unbelievable lie. Did anyone utter those  
words? Our e-mail, every piece of it, has been searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had found somebody who said it. Then we could take  
him out, and we could hang the guy, then we'd say OK, mea culpa. We 
found him -- the guy who said, `I'll cut off your oxygen.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge will give the two sides one month to review each  
other's documents, then make revisions to their own filings and 
return them Sept. 10. Courtroom arguments are set for Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> NBC, Snap.com Link With Net2Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC plans to acquire an equity stake in  
Net2phone Inc., a company that lets people make telephone calls 
through their personal computer, The Associated Press learned 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will prominently link and market the company's Internet  
telephone services on the NBC.com and NBC Interactive Neighborhood 
sites, according to an announcement of the deal obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement with Net2Phone will powerfully bridge NBC's  
Internet properties with the most ubiquitous consumer technology in 
the history of the world -- the telephone,'' Martin J. Yudkovitz, 
president of NBC Interactive Media, said in the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, the broadcasting unit of General Electric, and Snap.com, a  
joint venture between NBC and online media company CNET, would 
acquire an equity stake in Net2Phone, with NBC gaining the right to 
nominate a board member to Net2Phone's board of directors. 
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement was planned for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone Inc., based in Hackensack, N.J., successfully raised  
$81 million in an initial public offering of stock July 29. After 
an initial surge, the stock has drifted lower, closing Friday at 
$16.50, $1.50 above the offering price. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone charges just under 5 cents a minute for domestic calls  
anywhere in the United States. Calls from the United States to 
Argentina or Japan would be 42 cents and 17 cents a minute, 
respectively, according to rates posted on the company's Web site.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Probe Targets Panama Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. investigation of a Chinese  
immigrant-smuggling ring has resulted in the firing of three 
Panamanian government officials suspected of involvement, The Miami 
Herald reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Panama's intelligence agency, an airport director  
and the head of the national airport police were dismissed in June 
after Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares was told of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The three have been accused of belonging to a ring that sold  
Panamanian visas to Chinese immigrants who left as soon as they 
arrived for illegal entry into the United States through California 
and Texas, the Herald said, citing anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, premature disclosure of the investigation by U.S.  
Ambassador Simon Ferro riled the U.S. Justice Department, which 
fears it may not be able to build as strong a case as it wanted, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese community leaders say they have seen a surge in  
immigration over the past year or so while Samantha Smith was head 
of Panama's intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a CIA-trained intelligence officer, Cesar Martans,  
director of Tocumen International Airport, and Luis Arauz Chang, 
head of the national police's aviation service, lost their jobs in 
the shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Panamanian immigration records show that only 135 legal visas  
have been issued to Chinese immigrants this year, but community 
leaders say substantially more have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Kuo, then-publisher of Panama's Chinese-language daily El  
Expreso, told the Herald he talked with 31 illegal immigrants on a 
single flight from Hong Kong last month, and a reporter who made 
the same flight recently estimated about 30 were on her plane. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Sunday,  
Kuo said that leaders of Chinese communities in Panama, in 
conjunction with government officials, ``are involved in the 
business of selling visas ... under the pretext of 'helping 
families reunite in Panama.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some recently arrived Chinese immigrants have said they paid  
from $15,000 to $16,000 to obtain a 30-day tourist visa'' allowing 
them to fly from Hong Kong to Panama, Kuo said. Later, they paid as 
much as $3,000 to legalize their residency in Panama, he said. Kuo 
resigned from the newspaper on Saturday for personal reasons, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal immigrants were escorted out of the airport through  
the diplomatic lounge, avoiding immigration checkpoints, and 
traveled north by land, the Herald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferro canceled Smith's U.S. travel visa and wrote the Panamanian  
government detailing suspicions of her smuggling involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy considered the issue of Smith's visa for  
several weeks and consulted with the State Department before 
acting, but no one told Justice officials, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was fired June 11 within days of Ferro's letter.

<HEADLINE> Briggs Might Next Fight Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY (AP) -- Shannon Briggs' big plans for a fight with  
Mike Tyson remained in place but only barely after the heavyweight 
survived with a 10-round draw against Francois Botha Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a 3-to-1 underdog, unleashed a blistering 10th-round  
assault that left Briggs on the verge of going down. All three 
judges awarded Botha a 10-8 round, enabling him to obtain a 94-94 
score on two judges' cards; the third card had it 95-92 in Botha's 
favor. The result was a draw by the majority decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who landed numerous unanswered rights to the head in the  
final round, was unhappy with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won the fight,'' said the 30-year-old native of  
South Africa. ``But when it came to New Jersey, I figured I had to 
knock him out. The power that his manager has with the New Jersey 
(Boxing) Commission made it obvious to me I wasn't going to win a 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs' manager, Marc Roberts, said negotiations for a  
Briggs-Tyson bout, possibly for Dec. 11, are underway. A loss to 
Botha would have denied Briggs a chance at Tyson, and a career-high 
payday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy gave me a lot of trouble tonight,'' Briggs said. ``I  
thought I could just walk through his punches because I thought his 
power was not all that. I thought I would knock him out because his 
chin was not all that. But he was cagey, and he was very slick. I 
guess I underestimated him,'' Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned his attention to Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he called here during the fight and said, `Let's get  
it on,''' Briggs said of his fellow Brooklyn, N.Y., native. ``It 
would be great to have that fight, especially in New York. I'm 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he finished strongly, Botha had trouble early penetrating  
Briggs' 7-inch reach advantage. Botha's offense was non-existent 
for the first two rounds before he picked up his body assault in 
round three. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha appeared ready to take control after a big seventh round  
but a break in round eight gave Briggs a chance he capitalized on. 
Botha's mouthpiece fell out, providing a stop in the action that 
gave Briggs a chance to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	When the fight resumed, Briggs jumped on Botha, landing a  
combination capped by a left hook to the head to knock him down. 
Briggs, who was losing the round, instead emerged with a 10-8 
verdict on all three scorecards for a crucial turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw was the first for each fighter. Briggs is 31-2-1 with  
25 knockouts, while Botha is 39-2-1 with 24 knockouts. An announced 
crowd of 5,150 watched the bout at Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.

<HEADLINE> Lyonne Didn't Want To Revisit Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Natasha Lyonne, reliving her awkward  
teen-age years in the comedy ``American Pie'' wasn't something she 
really wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``People used to tell me I (seemed) older than my age. I could  
never tell if it was because I wasn't getting along with the other 
kids. It seems like that would be a really easy way to console a 
kid if she wasn't fitting in,'' the 20-year-old actress says in the 
Aug. 16 issue of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Even now, Lyonne, a New York native, says she still has some  
insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beat myself up for not being a good enough person. That's

<HEADLINE> Paltrow Stars in 'As You Like It' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Wearing a glam red strapless gown, a  
young woman scampers up and out of a trapdoor conspicuously placed 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite a first entrance but then this is not any ordinary vision  
in scarlet. It's Gwyneth Paltrow -- Academy Award-winning actress, 
Talk magazine cover girl and once close companion of Brad Pitt -- 
now facing audiences as Rosalind in ``As You Like It'' at the 
Williamstown Theater Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow's appearance launched a ticket frenzy at the festival,  
at least for the two weeks she is appearing here in the Shakespeare 
comedy. One has to admire her pluck in confronting a Mount Everest 
of expectations and sold-out performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, though. Paltrow acquits herself well, starting  
with her savvy choice of roles. Rosalind is one of the Bard's most 
endearing heroines, wise, witty and charming but not above being 
blissfully baffled by love. For the most part, Paltrow measures up 
to those adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Visually stunning, she looks as if she just stepped out of an  
oil painting by John Singer Sargent. Blond hair upswept, she 
resembles a young Grace Kelly, elegant but with just a smidgen of 
insecurity and sass thrown in to keep admirers off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosalind is that kind of woman. The character is basically  
proactive rather than reactive, which is why she is so appealing to 
today's theatergoers. Rosalind takes matters in her own hands, 
particularly the wooing and winning of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rosalind disguises herself as a man, you go along with the  
plan because of her determination, although even in pants, Paltrow 
manages to look radiant. So you know Orlando doesn't stand much of 
a chance, as Alessandro Nivola's moonstruck performance amply 
demonstrates. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet dewy sentimentality is never allowed to hijack the  
proceedings, even when all the characters find themselves in the 
Forest of Arden. It's depicted impressionistically rather than as a 
realistic leafy green refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	In director Barry Edelstein's eclectic, mostly modern-dress  
revival, a few tree trunks and twigs will suffice. The 
unsentimental mood is underlined by a jazz combo, placed upstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the men are garbed as if they were Day-Glo gangsters,  
wearing bright colors and black shades. Composer Mark Bennett's 
edgy background score complements the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow may be the draw but she is not the only attraction in  
this revival. Others command attention, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cumpsty, as the terminally melancholy Jaques, has the  
hardest task -- trying to find a new way to proclaim ``All the 
world's a stage,'' Shakespeare's famous Seven Ages of Man speech. 
Cumpsty plays it clear and straightforward, which makes it all the 
more affecting. 
</P>
<P>
	In many Shakespeare productions, the comic characters are  
impossible to make funny for modern audiences. Not so here. A 
marvelous Mark Linn-Baker captures the verbal dexterity of 
Touchstone, the not-so-foolish fool, as well as his comic 
pratfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Linn-Baker is matched in his physicality by Lea DeLaria, who  
portrays the rambunctious rustic Audrey as if she were a linebacker 
for the Oakland Raiders. Broad, bawdy and very funny, DeLaria looks 
like a demented Betty Rubble, a refugee from some Elizabethan 
``Flintstones'' who, when she is happily in love, scats along with 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the heart of the play is the courtship between Rosalind and  
Orlando. They don't battle as ferociously as the cantankerous 
lovers in ``The Taming of the Shrew'' or banter as effectively as 
the lovestruck duo in ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' but their 
sparring is just as effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The most satisfying moments occur in a mismatched minuet --  
beautifully staged by Edelstein -- involving Rosalind, Orlando, the 
poor shepherd Silvius and his beloved but uninterested Phoebe. 
Paltrow and Nivola are joined by John Ellison Conlee and Angelina 
Phillips in this delightful round robin that captures the delicious 
desperation of love. 
</P>
<P>
	The production draws to an end with a joyous rendition of the  
old Louis Armstrong anthem, ``It's a Wonderful World,'' sung by 
Larry Marshall, who plays Orlando's loyal servant Adam. 
</P>
<P>
	After Marshall finishes the song, Paltrow touchingly delivers  
the play's generous epilogue and then the two of them join with 
Nivola in a sweet, heaven-sent musical sigh that brings the curtain 
down. You can hear the audience sighing right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``As You Like It'' runs through Aug. 15.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Studied in National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GATLINBURG, Tenn. (AP) -- ``How's the air quality today?''  
</P>
<P>
	The question beckons from a new kiosk at the Sugarlands Visitors  
Center in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the main 
entrance to the most visited national park in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Monitors provide the instant answer with a real-time view of the  
Smokies' tallest peaks from a vantage atop the 2,600-foot Look Rock 
monitoring station, along with the current ozone concentration and 
other weather information. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparison scenes show the same vista on good days, when  
visibility stretches to nearly 100 miles, and the smog-filled bad 
ones, when there is no view at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter view is becoming increasingly common.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not getting any better from the standpoint of  
visibility,'' Smokies Superintendent Karen Wade said. ``And I think 
the trends are not very encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clean Air Act has produced significant reductions in  
air pollution in many parts of the country, there are indications 
conditions are getting worse for the Smokies, a half-million acre 
park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border, and the rest of the 
southern Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say naturally light winds predispose the region to  
some of the most frequent and lengthy periods of air stagnation in 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a hot spot,'' said Jim Renfro, air quality  
specialist for the park. ``We are downwind from a lot of 
(pollution) sources and a lot of (regional) growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One recent study found that, while sulfur dioxide emissions  
primarily from burning fossil fuels have declined nationally, the 
Smokies suffered a 21 percent increase between 1985 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal-fired power plants as far away as the Mississippi River and  
Ohio Valley blow into the Smokies and linger, causing haze and acid 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	So do pollutants from trucks and cars, including those of the  
some 10 million visitors to the park annually, leading to the 
formation of colorless ozone that can make breathing difficult, 
particularly up on mountain trails. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, the Smokies for the first time began issuing public  
health warnings when eight-hour ozone concentrations exceeded 
federal and state health standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhealthy ozone levels were marked a record 44 times last year,  
twice as many as the year before. The park recorded its highest 
eight-hour concentration last Aug. 25 -- 123 parts per billion, 50 
percent above healthy standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone levels have been slightly worse this summer. As of Aug. 5,  
there have been 18 days when ozone has exceeded health standards; 
by this time last year, there had been two fewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet on a recent sunny morning, the Sugarlands Visitors Center  
bustled with hikers and sightseers who barely noticed the 
air-quality kiosk as they rushed around for souvenirs and 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a problem? I didn't know,'' said Delbert Hacker, 65,  
of Vincennes, Ind., as he paused to look at the graphics and the 
Look Rock monitor on the kiosk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranger Pam Rodgers, who staffs an information desk near the  
kiosk, said people want to talk about it after coming down from 
Clingmans Dome, the Smokies' tallest summit. 
</P>
<P>
	First they ask what's happened to the fir trees, which are being  
destroyed by a nonnative insect. Then they ask what happened to the 
view, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The park and environmental groups have undertaken a  
subtle-though-ubiquitous campaign to tell visitors that air quality 
in the mountains sometimes is no better than in the cities they 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been doing monitoring since the mid-'80s,'' Smokies  
spokesman Bob Miller said. ``But it took us a while to feel 
comfortable enough with our science so that we could say for sure 
that there was damage occurring to park species because of air 
quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experiments in the Smokies have established that at least 30  
species of plants in the park are dying or have been damaged 
because of ozone and acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting the word out is taking several forms:  
</P>
<P>
	-- More air-quality kiosks will be installed at other Smokies'  
visitors centers. The information also is available on the Internet 
at www.nature.nps.gov/ard/parks/grsm/lookRockWeather. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The newsletter ``Smokies Guide. The Official Newspaper of  
Great Smokies Mountain National Park'' regularly contains articles 
on pollutants. In the latest issue a story headlined ``Air 
Pollution is Ruining Our Views'' said summertime vistas have been 
reduced by 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The National Parks and Conservation Association has targeted  
the Smokies as one of the country's most endangered parks. Its 
volunteers are handing out postcards visitors can send congressmen 
urging tougher emission standards for old coal-fired power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A new film for the visitors centers, produced by the Friends  
of the Great Smoky Mountains, talks for the first time about 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The park may be a sanctuary but it isn't an island,'' the  
film's narrator says. ``Its natural treasures are threatened by 
sprawling human development and nonnative pests and diseases. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``The Smokies were named for their natural blue mist. (But)  
today, air pollution from vehicles and smokestacks hundreds of 
miles away muddies the skies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Wade, a Sevier County native, state appeals court judge and  
president of the Friends group, acknowledged that some local 
business people may worry about scaring off tourists, but said the 
park's obligation is its preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, ``If you lived in this area for the last 50  
years like I have you know that the air quality is not as good as 
it was and the visibility some days is terrible. There are days in 
the summer when you can hardly see the outline of the 
mountaintops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an unprecedented stand by the park. But Wade said it is  
justified. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like the park is a barometer of what is happening in a  
much wider region,'' she said. ``And we have a duty and a 
responsibility to articulate the issue not only about how it 
affects the park itself but how it is affecting our neighboring 
communities.''

<HEADLINE> Cisco Gives Accounting Co. $1B Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cisco Systems, a leading maker of computer  
networking equipment, has agreed to invest $1 billion in KPMG LLP 
to aid the accounting and consulting firm's expansion onto the 
Internet, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose-Calif.-based Cisco was expected to announce the  
agreement Monday, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, KPMG will use the money to hire  
4,000 engineers and service professionals to develop and deliver 
Internet-based data, voice and video services to its clients, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 18 months, KPMG will build six technology centers  
-- four in the United States and two abroad, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Cisco will own a stake of less than 20 percent in  
KPMG, the U.S. unit of privately-held KPMG International, No. 3 
among the big five accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from both companies said they believe there is a  
winner-takes-all prize for companies that win the race to 
incorporate the Internet into their business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a realization that you can be out of business in  
three years,'' John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive told the 
Times. ``Whoever moves quickly first are those who will benefit 
over the next 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Butler, KPMG chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the New York-based firm has been courting potential technology 
partners in recent months. One result was a joint venture announced 
in June with Qwest Communications International to provide order 
processing.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Ends With Spirited Send-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The 13th Pan American Games slipped  
into history with a closing ceremony Sunday featuring splashes of 
culture from across the Americas and a send-off from this Canadian 
prairie city's most famous rock band. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tone of the opening was intended to be inspirational,  
Sunday's closing struck a note of the celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers meant to symbolize geese kicked off the evening, racing  
onto the field and forming the word ``Viva'' while a 15-piece band 
played a salsa tune. 
</P>
<P>
	As highlights of the competition played on the large screen at  
the far end of the stadium, some 2,500 athletes and coaches swept 
into Winnipeg's stadium en masse, an unruly gaggle who danced and 
swayed and gyrated to the beat. The flagbearer from Guyana did a 
little dance, dipping and swaying his South American country's 
banner. Two athletes carried hand lettered signs, ``Thank You 
Winnipeg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the greatest cheers were for the athletes from the  
Dominican Republic, site of the next Games, who carried a huge sign 
lettered in English and Spanish, ``See you all in Santo Domingo 
2003.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the more solemn moments of the event had their comical  
aspects. Just as in the opening ceremony, athletes started a wave 
during the speech of Mario Vazquez Rana, the head of the Pan 
American Sports Organization. Then, moments after he began 
speaking, a cloudburst drenched the field, prompting the athletes 
to scramble under the grandstand for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The bittersweet extravaganza's headliners were The Guess Who, a  
1960s band from Winnipeg famous for such hits as ``American 
Woman,'' and ``These Eyes.'' The band opened with ``No Time,'' as 
athletes, volunteers and anyone who could get to the field huddled 
around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's appearance was a coup for games organizers, who  
wanted the city's most famous rock export to perform -- just as they 
reportedly did in 1967, the last time Winnipeg was the site of the 
Pan Ams. One member of the band says he can't recall a concert 
during the games 32 years ago, but officials said photographs of 
the performance, featuring matching houndstooth jackets, exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their experience will mean a lot -- a bridge over the  
generations from the last games to these,'' said Brian Koshul, a 
spokesman for the games. ``It's a time to say goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was a chance for Winnipeggers to express their  
mixture of sadness and relief that the folksy regional Olympics 
have come to an end. Those who seemed most melancholy were 
volunteers filing into Winnipeg Stadium for the closing ceremony. 
The city mustered 20,000 volunteers, outfitted them in 
salmon-colored shirts and khakis and dispatched them to 33 venues 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, having a huge sporting event three years after losing  
its professional hockey team, the Winnipeg Jets, provided a needed 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we lost the Jets, people have been a little down,'' said  
Tom Tierney, 52, a retired civil servant who volunteered for the 
boxing, volleyball and artistic gymnastics competitions. ``This 
brings us back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dignitaries joining the spectators were Jean Chretien,  
Canada's premier, and Johny Ventura, the mayor of Santo Domingo, 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead act may have been from rock 'n' roll, but opera,  
calypso, merengue and cha cha rhythms added an eclectic feel to the 
event. A masked parade of Caribbean performers added swathes of 
purple, gold and red to the field at Winnipeg Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes, led by the Canadians, jumped out of the stands and  
joined the dancers as the Dominicans raced around the edge of the 
field with their banner. After a lap, the Dominicans crowded around 
the stage for the dignitaries. Ventura jumped to his feet and 
danced with his compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
	The most solemn moment of the games came when the cauldron was  
extinguished and the flame symbolically passed to Santo Domingo. An 
aria was composed for the event, but the steady rain put out most 
of the fire anyway, taking away the drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnipeg now joins Mexico City as the second country to have  
been host of the Pan Ams on two occasions. The Canadian city's 
first event, in 1967, involved 2,400 athletes from 28 countries who 
took part in 23 sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the games were last held here in 1967, the community  
talked about that event for 30 years,'' said Larry Desrochers, the 
producer-director of the opening and closing ceremonies. ``I think 
Winnipeg and the country will talk about these games for the next 
30 years.''

<HEADLINE> Woods, Dion Pitch In on Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- More than 1,000 fans turned out to help golf  
star Tiger Woods raise money for his foundation benefiting 
underprivileged young people, and his biggest fan -- singer Celine 
Dion -- shared the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not only the number one golfer, he's the number one human  
being,'' Dion said of Woods during her 30-minute performance at 
Tiger Jam II. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion's voice broke with emotion as she told the audience how her  
husband and manager Rene Angelil -- also a big Woods fan -- had been 
diagnosed with skin cancer four months ago. Since then, Angelil has 
had the cancer removed from his neck and is undergoing radiation 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion said Woods called three times in the next three weeks to  
inquire about Angelil's progress and boost his morale. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's event included an auction of a dozen items that  
raised $242,500 for the California-based Tiger Woods Foundation, 
Inc. Fetching the most money was a round of golf with Woods at his 
home course in Orlando, Fla. that went for $65,000.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Activists Disrupt Gore Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LACONIA , N.H. (AP) -- Activists protesting U.S. opposition to a  
South African AIDS drug policy disrupted a campaign speech by Vice 
President Al Gore Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's greed kills,'' they chanted as Gore tried to address  
about 100 voters. ``AIDS drugs for Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said above the din, ``Let's hear it for free speech. ...  
I'd like to talk to you about the risky Republican tax scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore then offered to meet with the activists later. ``I'll be  
glad to talk to you all after the event if you want to have a 
conversation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several activists were escorted out of the building but were not  
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS activists from ACT-UP have been protesting U.S. trade  
policies toward South Africa at Gore events for months. They say 
administration policies increase the difficulty of getting 
affordable AIDS drugs to South Africans who need them. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants the Pretoria government to amend a 1997  
law giving it unspecified power to obtain cheaper, generic AIDS 
drugs for the country, where more than 3 million people have the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa wants to import AIDS medicines from countries where  
they are sold more cheaply under patent agreements, or license 
production within South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 pharmaceutical companies worldwide are challenging the  
law in South African courts, fearing it may be used in a way that 
violates their patent rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus,  
Gore said in June that he does not oppose South Africa's attempts 
to produce or obtain generic AIDS medicines as long as those 
efforts do not violate laws protecting patents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he was trying to resolve the dispute with then-Vice  
President Thabo Mbeki, who is now South Africa's president. Mbeki 
and Gore co-chair a commission on U.S.-South African relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was the guest of honor at the Belknap County Democrats'  
picnic in Laconia and then at the Merrimack County Democrats' pig 
roast at a Hopkinton home. Nine AIDS activists confronted Gore 
inside St. James Episcopal Church in Laconia, where the picnic was 
moved due to rain. The group followed him to Hopkinton, but was not 
allowed onto the grounds of the home. The protesters chanted and 
handed out leaflets to passersby. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Gore outlined a $100 million initiative to fight  
AIDS in Africa. The spending proposals included $48 million for 
AIDS education, counseling and testing.

<HEADLINE> Marathon Swim Results in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The results of the Atlantic City  
Ocean Marathon Swim are in doubt after swimming's international 
governing body voted Sunday to uphold the suspensions of the winner 
and third-place finisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The doping panel of FINA voted to uphold the suspensions of  
David Meca-Medina and Igor Majcen of Slovenia, race director Sid 
Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The international swimming federation temporarily suspended  
Meca-Medina and Majcen in May, saying both tested positive for the 
steroid nandrolone during the Jan. 31 World Cup event in Salvador 
de Bahia, Brazil. FINA issued a letter Aug. 2 temporarily staying 
the suspensions and allowing the swimmers to compete in Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Race organizers issued a press release Sunday explaining FINA's  
decision to uphold the suspensions, but no reason for the 
international governing body's reversal of its temporary stay of 
the suspensions was given in the release. 
</P>
<P>
	Meca-Medina won Saturday's race, completing the 22-mile swim  
around Absecon Island in six hours, 56 minutes and 43 seconds and 
breaking the course record by six seconds. Majcen came in third, 
finishing in 7:07:26. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Ocean Marathon Swim is part of the FINA World Cup  
circuit, their wins will be classified as ``provisional'' and their 
prize money will be placed in escrow, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to FINA rules, the swimmers may appeal the doping  
panel's decision to the International Court of Arbitration for 
Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy said that in the event that the ban is upheld through  
the final round of appeals, second-place finisher Andre Wilde of 
Germany will be declared the winner, and those finishing behind 
Majcen will move up accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Computers Translate As People Speak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sloppy speakers, rejoice.  
</P>
<P>
	Not only can new technology translate conversations into six  
languages, but it can also clean up grammar and omit those awkward 
``ums'' and ``urs'' that bog down sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can even recognize noises like lip smacks,'' said Alex  
Waibel, director of the Interactive Systems Laboratories at the 
Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists and other researchers from an international  
consortium demonstrated the speech translation technology recently 
during a video conference with people in Japan, Italy, Korea and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``What time is it in Japan?'' CMU graduate student Chad Langley  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Within seconds, Langley's sentence was translated into Japanese  
and heard by a scientist posing as a travel agent in Kyoto. The 
agent responded in Japanese and the computer translated his 
response to English: ``It's 1 a.m. in Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langley asked another person about the weather in Korea -- it was  
fine -- and queried about conditions in Germany -- it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he obtained flight times, locations and prices for a flight  
to Heidelberg and made a reservation. He asked the agent to 
recommend a nice hotel. She suggested the Hotel Ritter and 
transmitted pictures of the historic hotel via a Web page. A 
question about nice places to visit brought pictures of Heidelberg 
Castle and tour information. 
</P>
<P>
	``How should I pay?'' Langley asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can pay with a credit card,'' the agent said.  
</P>
<P>
	Langley doesn't speak a word of German, Japanese, Italian or  
Korean. 
</P>
<P>
	But the international Consortium for Speech Translation Advanced  
Research -- C-STAR -- has a system with more than 10,000 words that 
can allow spontaneous speech through a Web-based system. 
</P>
<P>
	If a mistake in translation is made, it can be easily corrected  
before it is transmitted, because a screen shows the translation as 
it is made but before it is heard at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the user can even choose the degree of speech  
formality, and scientists surprised their Japanese counterpart on 
Thursday by using the local Kyoto dialect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like a Japanese imitating a southern drawl,''  
Waibel said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the program is limited to information related to travel  
such as flight schedules and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go from a narrow domain to a broad domain to no  
restrictions whatsoever,'' said Jaime Carbonell, who directs the 
Language Technologies Institute at CMU. 
</P>
<P>
	Even better, scientists hope to improve voice synthesis, so the  
computer will translate not only words but also the expression and 
inflection that comes with them -- ``so it's not just the content, 
but also the emotion,'' Carbonell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, scientists are working on getting voice  
translation out among the masses. 
</P>
<P>
	A CMU student in Germany appeared by video conference on the  
screens in Pittsburgh, looking a bit like Inspector Gadget as he 
trooped around Heidelberg Castle during a heavy downpour. He wore a 
headset and a backpack with a laptop inside. Strapped on his 
forearm was a computer the size of a paperback book. 
</P>
<P>
	Touching a special pen to the computer screen a few times, he  
translated into German his English request for a bystander to take 
his picture. He then called up precise directions -- which retained 
the German street names -- and found background information on 
points of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	While Waibel admits the getup may look ``a little geeky'' he  
said scientists are working on smaller and smaller versions that 
could soon be mass-produced and sold commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these things that we are showing you will be coming to  
a credit card near you soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> No Cap on Calif. Campaign Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A fund-raising free-for-all has broken  
out in California, where about the only rule governing donations to 
politicians running for state office is that the contributor must 
be a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 208, approved three years ago, briefly imposed  
limits on personal and corporate donations. But a federal judge 
threw the law out, leaving California one of six states with no 
caps on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis disclosed last week that he raised nearly $6.4  
million in the first half of the year, more than three years before 
he faces re-election. Much of the money has come from firms, groups 
and people with a direct interest in legislation he is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	The total drawfs that of his predecessor, Pete Wilson, a  
Republican who collected one-fifth that amount in the six months 
after he first took office in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is not alone. Big donations from casinos, insurance  
companies and others with an interest in legislation helped 
lawmakers collect at least $18.2 million so far -- in this 
non-election year. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of caps on political donations may have accelerated  
the frenzy, with some politicians intent on stocking war chests as 
insurance against new regulations already in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign-finance bill that would limit donations is pending in  
the Legislature. Future court action could revive Proposition 208, 
and a similar ballot measure will go to voters next year if 
proponents gather enough signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The object is to get as much money in as possible so if either  
of these things occur, they'd at least have money in the bank. That 
is driving the find-raising activities,'' said Tony Miller, a 
former top state elections official and the co-author of the two 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``People assume what we're seeing is influence-buying, and that  
is very harmful to the democratic process,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The frenetic fund raising in a non-election year has touched off  
more than the usual grumbling from good-government advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer watchdog Ralph Nader said he was so disgusted by Davis'  
fund-raising that he felt compelled to inject himself into 
California politics from his Washington, D.C., headquarters. He 
demanded that Davis freeze his efforts to collect new donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times, in an editorial Thursday, lamented that  
contributors' ``seemingly endless access to the governor and 
legislators looks bad, no matter what the reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' chief political adviser, Garry South, denies that  
campaign contributions win access to the governor's ear, and said 
potential new donation restrictions haven't caused Davis to 
intensify fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is far more concerned about having to fight off wealthy  
challengers, South said. Davis came from behind to beat two 
self-financed candidates, Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman, in the 
1998 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know who's out there,'' South said, adding that none  
of the current campaign-finance proposals would restrict rich 
candidates from spending unlimited sums on their own campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is likely that other politicians are stepping up their  
fund-raising efforts due to the potential for donation 
restrictions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	California, home to Hollywood, Silicon Valley, oil conglomerates  
and huge agricultural concerns, has a seemingly endless pool of 
millionaires and monied business interests eager to feed 
politicians' appetite for campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller is bent on getting contribution limits passed by  
voters again and on protecting the new rules from court challenges. 
He thinks he has crafted just such an initiative this time around, 
and believes he will have enough signatures in coming days to place 
it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	History is on his side.  
</P>
<P>
	Every campaign-finance initiative on the California ballot in  
recent years has passed except one, he notes. The one that failed, 
Proposition 212 in 1996, was competing against a similar measure -- 
Proposition 208 -- and fell just short of 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Racism in Criminal Justice Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It's becoming a familiar tale of ``driving while  
black'' -- a carload of black men is pulled over by police who want 
to search for drugs even though there is no evidence the men are 
carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, one of the men in the car was a Washington, D.C.,  
public defender who sued the Maryland police and won a settlement. 
Robert Wilkins spoke about the 1992 incident during an American Bar 
Association discussion Sunday about racism in the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, the Justice Department's acting civil rights  
chief, told the audience, ``We are talking about civil rights 
violations'' in such incidents. ``These stories are legion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said such practices also are bad law enforcement because  
while police might find small-time couriers, they may be ``missing 
very big fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said Attorney General Janet Reno is ``convinced that you can  
have law enforcement that's sensitive to these issues, avoid racial 
profiling, and be effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow racial discrimination to occur, then we're just  
undermining the whole community policing concept,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderator of the discussion, American University law  
professor Angela Jordan Davis, asked, ``How is it that the issue of 
racism in criminal justice is still so pervasive in 1999?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't prosecutors have the power in fact to dismiss these  
cases'' if they involve unfairness based on race, Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Houston law professor Sandra Guerra said focusing  
on prosecutors might not work. ``Prosecutors can't identify all the 
people who should have been stopped who weren't stopped,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Court of Appeals Judge Wendell L. Griffen, a member of  
the audience, suggested, ``The buck can stop with judges'' who can 
throw out cases involving racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffen said some type of cost should be imposed on those  
responsible for race-based prosecutions. ``Racism so far doesn't 
cost anybody anything in this system except the victims,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Jackson, a prosecutor in Atlanta, wondered from the  
audience, ``How do we fix these things as a group? People vote for 
politicians who are going to be tough on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins suggested, ``You can say you're tough on crime and still  
have an agenda that's smart on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins said the settlement in his case required the Maryland  
state police to report on searches they conducted along Interstate 
95. The results showed a high share of black motorists being 
searched, although drugs were found on them no more frequently than 
on white motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The disparity showed up even though the police knew of the  
reporting requirement, he said. ``It changed my view, 
unfortunately, for the worse about whether the legal system can 
address these kinds of issues.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Touts Texas' Education Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush urged the National Urban  
League Conference Sunday to consider Texas a model for changes that 
can be made on a national level. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner touted Texas' success  
at improving public education, noting that student test scores in 
the state's public schools have risen across the board, 
``especially (for) African American and Hispanic students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bush told the 4,000 black community and business leaders and  
activists about the abolition of social promotion of Texas students 
as a step toward ensuring that all students are able to ``access 
the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen what works in this state. We've raised the bar of  
expectations,'' Bush said. ``We've aligned authority and 
responsibility where it belongs, at the local level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's appearance at the Urban League's annual convention is  
part of his drive to appeal to ethnic minority voters, who have 
historically supported Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance came two weeks after Bush's absence from the  
annual convention of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic 
advocacy group, drew sharp criticism from his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Bush turned down a chance to speak at a meeting of  
minority journalists in Seattle, though he was campaigning in that 
city at the time. He eventually made a brief appearance at that 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day Urban League conference is drawing top candidates  
from the 2000 presidential race. Bush was the first of several 
contestants slated to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for next year's  
Democratic nomination, is due to address the convention Monday. His 
closest Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is 
to speak Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, advocating what he called ``the hard work of compassion,''  
told the group that government money should support groups with 
successful social-aid programs -- such as faith-based organizations, 
churches, synagogues and charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had success because they change lives by changing  
hearts, but they don't have the resources they need to continue 
waging the war,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  French Troops Clash With Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians angry  
over the division of their town hurled stones and taunted French 
peacekeepers again Sunday, demanding free movement across a bridge 
into the Serb district. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second day of clashes between protesters and French  
troops on the bridge in the northwestern mining town of Kosovska 
Mitrovica, underscoring the continuing difficulties peacekeepers 
face in imposing peace on a province torn by ethnic hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort designed to help NATO-led troops impose law and  
order in Kosovo, a group of around 500 new civilian police from 10 
nations, including the United States, reported for duty Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the first group to finish training for a planned  
3,100-strong international police force. The European Union envoy 
to Kosovo, however, has questioned whether the force was enough to 
stem the nearly daily violence between Kosovo's ethnic Albanians 
and Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Kosovska Mitrovica, French troops have been trying for weeks  
to prevent frictions by barring most traffic across the bridge over 
the Ibar river, separating the two communities' neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 150 young ethnic Albanian men threw stones at troops  
blocking the bridge Sunday with an armored personnel carrier, 
waving red-and-black Albanian flags and cursing the soldiers as 
``terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one protester was arrested. One French soldier was led  
away dazed by his comrades after a stone struck him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to cool down the tension,'' said French Capt.  
Bertrand Bonneau. ``We try to understand they are impatient. We 
must remain vigilant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's incident was on a smaller scale than a confrontation  
the previous day when up to 1,000 ethnic Albanians tried to cross 
the bridge, where hundreds of Serbs were waiting, taunting them 
with profanity. The peacekeepers forced back the crowd, arresting 
four people. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, NATO officials said French troops opened fire when  
gunmen attacked a Serb residential district in Kosovska Mitrovica 
using small arms and grenades. One attacker was arrested, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although more than 35,000 NATO-led peacekeepers are now in  
Kosovo, murders, abductions and other violence are the daily norm. 
The victims now are most often Serbs targeted by ethnic Albanians 
seeking revenge for more than a year of savage Serb repression that 
ended in June, after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed 
to pull his troops out of the Serbian province in exchange for an 
end to a NATO bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers have been unable to stem the violence, and  
their representatives argue that as a military force, their primary 
job is not to act as police. 
</P>
<P>
	But EU envoy Martti Ahtisaari, the president of Finland,  
insisted NATO should continue to have the main responsibility for 
keeping order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid the role of the international police force hasn't  
been properly thought out,'' Ahtisaari, a chief broker of the 
Kosovo peace plan, told Finnish radio last week. ``The idea that 
3,000 police could maintain order ... is out of this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In apparent ethnic violence this weekend, a Serb bar in Pristina  
was hit by a grenade attack that wounded three Serbs. Another 
grenade attack early Sunday left one suspect wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency said four Serbs in the village  
of Gornja Brnjica, north of Pristina, were wounded Saturday by 
shots fired from a passing car. The private Beta news agency said 
several Serb houses in the southwestern city of Prizren were burned 
down Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bad Finger Forces Out Mets' Reed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets right-hander Rick Reed left  
Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the second inning 
with a strained right middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was replaced by Masato Yoshii after walking Craig Counsell  
with two outs in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshii, making his second career relief appearance, came in and  
allowed a three-run homer to Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort to 
give Los Angeles a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Dreifort's second career homer and first since July 28,  
1998, against Arizona's Omar Daal. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was charged with three runs and two hits in 1 2-3 innings.  
Reed, who entered the game with a 10-3 record and 4.78 ERA, was 
undergoing an MRI to determine the severity of the injury.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Athlete Plans To Seek Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cuban basketball player Juan Leopoldo Vazquez, who defected  
during the Pan American Games with the aid of a Miami-based exile 
group, was in Toronto on Sunday, where he plans to seek political 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninoska Perez of the Miami-based Cuban American National  
Foundation, said Vazquez will remain in the Canadian city with a 
former teammate and fellow defector while he resolves his 
immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez defected Saturday night while attending a women's  
basketball game between Cuba and Brazil in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to take a few days to think things out and see what  
he wants to do,'' said Perez. ``We'll get him an immigration 
attorney in Toronto, and from there on he'll decide what he wants 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez said Vazquez has an uncle who lives in Miami, but his  
parents live in Cuba. His father is a member of the Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke with his mother by phone Saturday, but asked a neighbor  
to delay telling her he was defecting so he wouldn't have to hear 
her crying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very sad,'' said Perez. ``He talked to her and he never  
told her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Vazquez will stay with Augusto Duquesne, a former  
basketball player on the Cuban national team who defected ``two to 
three'' years ago, according to Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez eluded the Cuban security guards shadowing players at  
the sporting event long enough to contact representatives from the 
exile group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had made contact with him. ... There were a lot of security  
agents around us, so he passed us a note telling us he would do it 
that evening during the Cuban women's basketball game,'' said 
Perez. ``We kind of walked out the door. We already had a running 
van outside and left to our hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, five members of Cuba's national basketball team  
defected while in Puerto Rico for the Olympic qualifying 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that here I'll have the liberty that I've always  
wanted, and I'll be able to do what I have always wanted to do in 
regards to cultural development,'' Vazquez told WLTV-TV in Miami. 
``Without any harm coming to me, without having to obey anyone. To 
be free like I've always dreamed.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Prevails Over Rapids 5-0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Lubos Kubik scored two second-half goals to lead  
the Chicago Fire to a 5-0 victory Sunday over the Colorado Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Chicago's first victory in three games against the Rapids  
this season and it moved them into second place in the MLS' Western 
Conference, just six points behind Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Ante Razov scored the only goal of the first half in the 19th  
minute and Chicago added four more in the second. Josh Wolff and 
Dema Kovalenko had the other goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton had two key saves in the second  
half to preserve the shutout, his fifth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway though the first half, Fire defender Jerzy Podbrozny and  
coach Bob Bradley were ejected from the game for arguing that Wolff 
was tripped on a Chicago scoring chance and no call was made.

<HEADLINE> Inmates Give Aid to Dying Convicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Harvey Caron went to prison for killing a  
man. Now, on the inside, he helps people die. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of 19 inmates, all but three of them convicted  
killers, who volunteer to care for the dying in the new hospice at 
the Oregon State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The work ``gives me a reason, because there's not much in  
here,'' Caron said. ``I can't change what I did. All I can do is 
live my life the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caron, 45 and serving a life sentence, helps care for Lou  
Miller, a convicted murderer whose cancer has spread to his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 68, doesn't have much use for his fellow inmates. But he  
likes the hospice volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a man has been here so long, all those feelings of  
compassion get burned out of him,'' he said. ``This hospice thing 
opens people up more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With tougher sentencing laws and the spread of HIV, more and  
more inmates are dying behind bars. According to a 1998 National 
Institute of Corrections report, more than 800 inmates around the 
country were terminally ill in 1998, facing a death sentence 
imposed by no judge or jury. Oregon alone expects 800 inmates to 
die behind bars in the next 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in deaths has led to something relatively new in  
the field of corrections: the prison hospice. 
</P>
<P>
	Since inmates at the Federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility  
in Springfield, Mo., created the first in 1987, the prison hospice 
has spread to California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina 
and Texas. Twelve other states are considering them, and South 
Carolina and Louisiana are expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon State Penitentiary opened its hospice in April.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these people don't have any family who want to see  
them,'' said William Cahall, the prison's health services manager. 
``They may have alienated their families, or their families are not 
alive. This is our way of making sure they don't die alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dying without family or friends is one of an inmate's greatest  
fears, said Tanya Tillman, hospice case manager at Louisiana State 
Penitentiary in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hospice is a philosophy,'' Cahall said. ``It basically means  
you have accepted that you have a terminal illness. You are not 
going to be seeking curative treatment. Nearly all your treatment 
will be pain control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Briseldo Escobedo, 23, became the first inmate to die  
in the Oregon prison hospice. His family tried to bring him home to 
Medford to die, but the parole board refused after the mother of 
the man he had killed objected. 
</P>
<P>
	In the prison hospice with cancer, his last days were spent with  
his family and inmate volunteers around him. Using a special pump, 
he was able to give himself as much morphine intravenously as he 
needed to control his pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Oregon's assisted suicide law, a dying inmate can ask a  
physician to prescribe a lethal dose of medication. The Department 
of Correction is not looking forward to the day it is confronted 
with such a request. How could anyone be sure such a request was 
motivated by physical pain rather than the emotional pain of 
imprisonment? 
</P>
<P>
	``If a person is choosing suicide because of incarceration, I  
don't believe you could make the statute apply,'' said health 
services administrator Catherine Knox. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison administrators are finding that hospices may have more  
impact on the living than on the dying. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Texas Department of Corrections Michael Unit in  
Palestine, Texas, violent episodes dropped sharply after inmates 
began caring for the dying, Dr. Jason Calhoun, the department's 
medical director, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really understand why,'' Calhoun said, but somehow the  
hospice changed how inmates dealt with life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet Maull, a convicted cocaine dealer who helped establish a  
federal prison hospice program and who founded the National Prison 
Hospice Association, said hospice restores humanity by giving both 
guards and inmates permission to care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings everybody's self-esteem up,'' he said. ``They begin  
to feel, `We are a community that takes care of ourselves. We don't 
just let our guys die with nobody taking care of them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wilson, who has been in prison for 11 years for a burglary  
that turned into a double murder and has no hope of getting out, 
felt his life change as he cared for Escobedo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated who I had become,'' Wilson said. When he read in The  
Wall Street, the prison newsletter, about the hospice starting up, 
he asked to help. 
</P>
<P>
	A nurse brought Wilson to Escobedo's bedside in the infirmary.  
The two shook hands, Wilson sat down on the floor next to 
Escobedo's bed, and they started to talk. Over the next 36 days, 
they became brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Each day, after working as a legal aid in the prison law  
library, Wilson, 30, visited the infirmary, often staying until 
midnight or 2 a.m. Wilson bathed and fed Escobedo and listened as 
the man explored his feelings about death. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel a lot more human when you are involved in this,''  
Wilson said. ``I realized that I do care, and I do have that 
capacity within myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reason I am doing it is to try to make up for what  
I did to those people (he killed), to make up for the things I've 
done,'' Wilson said. ``Part of it is for myself.''

<HEADLINE> Ecton Park Wins Grade II Jim Dandy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Ecton Park raced to a 5 1/2-length  
victory in Sunday's 36th running of the $300,000, Grade II Jim 
Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont Stakes, was a well-beaten  
runnerup in the seven-horse field. It was another two lengths to 
Badger Gold. The order of finish was completed by Best of Luck, 
Vicar, Vision and Verse and Key to Success. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park raced in the first group through the first seven  
furlongs, established a clear advantage once into the stretch and 
went the rest of the way unthreatened. 
</P>
<P>
	In his previous start, Ecton Park was second behind Stellar  
Brush in the Grade II Ohio Derby at Thistledown. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the third in eight starts this year for Ecton Park,  
who covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:49:2 over the sloppy track to earn 
$180,000 for Mark H. Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park was a late addition to the Jim Dandy cast. Earlier in  
the week, trainer Elliott Walden indicated that the colt would run 
in Monmouth's $1 million Haskell Handicap instead. When it was 
learned that Stephen Got Even would not run in the Jim Dandy, Ecton 
Park was kept at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purse is a lot less,'' Walden said, ``but that can be  
recouped very easily if we can be a Grade II winner at Saratoga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scotty Schulhofer, trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, was not  
discouraged by the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``My horse ran great,'' he said. ``He hates that kind of going,  
but he still ran good. He's a much better horse on a dry track. The 
race should set him up just perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer indicated that Lemon Drop Kid's next start will be in  
the Grade I, $1 million Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park returned $15, $6.50 and $4.70. Lemon Drop Kid paid  
$4.80 and $3.50 and Badger Gold was $6.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Feds Says No To Grain Testing Plan / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A federal agency won't support a proposal  
aimed at reducing the costly effects farmers attribute to the 
margin of error in grain testing for a toxin produced by the crop 
disease known as scab. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was considered the most important of 10  
recommendations several North Dakota organizations submitted to the 
U.S. Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration, which 
oversees grain-testing standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a grave mistake on GIPSA's part,'' said John  
Mittleider, executive administrator of the North Dakota Barley 
Council. ``I would think that they would understand the seriousness 
of the situation out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vomitoxin, also known as deoxynivalnol or DON, is a byproduct of  
scab, a fungus that has cost wheat and barley farmers in Minnesota 
and North Dakota hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed change the agency rejected would have required it  
to encourage private companies that buy and test barley to stop 
recording vomitoxin levels to the nearest tenth of a part of 
vomitoxin per million parts barley. Instead, it would have rounded 
the toxin's levels in barley to the nearest whole number. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would have helped make up for the margin of error in  
the testing, Mittleider said. 
</P>
<P>
	GIPSA Administrator James Baker said he couldn't support the  
proposal because test results rounded to the nearest whole number 
would not meet all the demands of domestic and export contracts 
that require stringent limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reporting any result with a standard error of deviation could  
cause unnecessary confusion to buyers and sellers,'' Baker said in 
a letter to the barley council. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers make more money on barley with zero or very low  
vomitoxin levels because they can sell it as a beer ingredient. 
Brewers impose strict limits on how much of the toxin can be 
present in the barley they'll use in beer because it can affect 
beverage quality. 
</P>
<P>
	A small amount of vomitoxin can mean the difference between  
getting the higher price, and the margin of error alone in current 
testing technology can prevent farmers from getting the better 
price, Mittleider said. 
</P>
<P>
	GIPSA officials said they understand the magnitude of the  
problem. They pledged to implement some of the recommendations to 
try to improve accuracy in testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency plans to consult with the Agriculture Department's  
Agricultural Research Service to determine if the precision of 
field tests can be improved. Baker said GIPSA officials have 
contacted manufacturers of approved testing equipment to see if 
accuracy can be improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations were put together by the barley council, the  
North Dakota Grain Growers Association and GIPSA's Grand Forks 
field office after a study they conducted last summer found that 
demands for accuracy in the tests may not be consistently achieved 
with current testing technology. 
</P>
<P>
	A March report by the General Accounting Office supported that  
finding, and additionally found that North Dakota barley farmers 
lost about $200 million to scab and vomitoxin between 1993 and 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Internet Address Bidding High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bidding for use of the Internet address  
Drugs.com jumped wildly every few minutes before an auction closed 
with an offer of $823,456. 
</P>
<P>
	The business that submitted the winning bid Friday wanted to  
remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Several large drug companies and well-heeled speculators had  
expressed an interest, according to Eric MacIver, a 21-year-old 
Internet entrepreneur in Mesa, Ariz., who held an option on the 
Drugs.com domain name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bidder will emerge as someone of note,'' possibly at a  
news conference in a week or so, said Steve Newman, executive vice 
president of online broker GreatDomains. GreatDomains, based in Los 
Angeles, was joined by Dotbroker.com in conducting the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Internet names currently on auction include Loans.com with  
a high bid as of Friday at $480,000. ``We're going to set an end 
date in two or three weeks,'' Newman said of the Loans.com name 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Other names attracting early interest at auction include  
Tobacco.com ($150,000 bid), Slim.com ($200,000), Houses.com 
($65,000) and VideoDating.com ($35,000). No dates for the end of 
those auctions have been set. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the name Wallstreet.com was sold for $1 million to a  
Venezuelan company, but a relative bargain currently up for auction 
is Wallstreet.org ($45,000 bid as of Friday). 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Compaq Computer Corp. paid $3.35 million for the name  
AltaVista.com for its AltaVista search engine. Since then, Compaq 
sold a controlling stake in the engine to the Internet investment 
company CMGI Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	MacIver said that in May he purchased on option to buy the  
Drugs.com name from Bonnie Neubeck, owner of a Minneapolis Internet 
marketing company, when he had been considering an online drug sale 
business. MacIver later decided against forming such a company, but 
he is expected to get the biggest share of the auction price for 
Drugs.com. Mrs. Neubeck will receive the option amount. Neither 
would disclose terms of their agreement.

<HEADLINE> Paltrow Stars in 'As You Like It' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                     *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Wearing a glam red strapless gown, a  
young woman scampers up and out of a trapdoor conspicuously placed 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite a first entrance but then this is not any ordinary vision  
in scarlet. It's Gwyneth Paltrow -- Academy Award-winning actress, 
Talk magazine cover girl and once close companion of Brad Pitt -- 
now facing audiences as Rosalind in ``As You Like It'' at the 
Williamstown Theater Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow's appearance launched a ticket frenzy at the festival,  
at least for the two weeks she is appearing here in the Shakespeare 
comedy. One has to admire her pluck in confronting a Mount Everest 
of expectations and sold-out performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, though. Paltrow acquits herself well, starting  
with her savvy choice of roles. Rosalind is one of the Bard's most 
endearing heroines, wise, witty and charming but not above being 
blissfully baffled by love. For the most part, Paltrow measures up 
to those adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Visually stunning, she looks as if she just stepped out of an  
oil painting by John Singer Sargent. Blond hair upswept, she 
resembles a young Grace Kelly, elegant but with just a smidgen of 
insecurity and sass thrown in to keep admirers off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosalind is that kind of woman. The character is basically  
proactive rather than reactive, which is why she is so appealing to 
today's theatergoers. Rosalind takes matters in her own hands, 
particularly the wooing and winning of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rosalind disguises herself as a man, you go along with the  
plan because of her determination, although even in pants, Paltrow 
manages to look radiant. So you know Orlando doesn't stand much of 
a chance, as Alessandro Nivola's moonstruck performance amply 
demonstrates. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet dewy sentimentality is never allowed to hijack the  
proceedings, even when all the characters find themselves in the 
Forest of Arden. It's depicted impressionistically rather than as a 
realistic leafy green refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	In director Barry Edelstein's eclectic, mostly modern-dress  
revival, a few tree trunks and twigs will suffice. The 
unsentimental mood is underlined by a jazz combo, placed upstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the men are garbed as if they were Day-Glo gangsters,  
wearing bright colors and black shades. Composer Mark Bennett's 
edgy background score complements the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow may be the draw but she is not the only attraction in  
this revival. Others command attention, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cumpsty, as the terminally melancholy Jaques, has the  
hardest task -- trying to find a new way to proclaim ``All the 
world's a stage,'' Shakespeare's famous Seven Ages of Man speech. 
Cumpsty plays it clear and straightforward, which makes it all the 
more affecting. 
</P>
<P>
	In many Shakespeare productions, the comic characters are  
impossible to make funny for modern audiences. Not so here. A 
marvelous Mark Linn-Baker captures the verbal dexterity of 
Touchstone, the not-so-foolish fool, as well as his comic 
pratfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Linn-Baker is matched in his physicality by Lea DeLaria, who  
portrays the rambunctious rustic Audrey as if she were a linebacker 
for the Oakland Raiders. Broad, bawdy and very funny, DeLaria looks 
like a demented Betty Rubble, a refugee from some Elizabethan 
``Flintstones'' who, when she is happily in love, scats along with 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the heart of the play is the courtship between Rosalind and  
Orlando. They don't battle as ferociously as the cantankerous 
lovers in ``The Taming of the Shrew'' or banter as effectively as 
the lovestruck duo in ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' but their 
sparring is just as effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The most satisfying moments occur in a mismatched minuet --  
beautifully staged by Edelstein -- involving Rosalind, Orlando, the 
poor shepherd Silvius and his beloved but uninterested Phoebe. 
Paltrow and Nivola are joined by John Ellison Conlee and Angelina 
Phillips in this delightful round robin that captures the delicious 
desperation of love. 
</P>
<P>
	The production draws to an end with a joyous rendition of the  
old Louis Armstrong anthem, ``It's a Wonderful World,'' sung by 
Larry Marshall, who plays Orlando's loyal servant Adam. 
</P>
<P>
	After Marshall finishes the song, Paltrow touchingly delivers  
the play's generous epilogue and then the two of them join with 
Nivola in a sweet, heaven-sent musical sigh that brings the curtain 
down. You can hear the audience sighing right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Paltrow's connection to the festival has been more than  
professional. Her mother, actress Blythe Danner, has been a 
longtime member of its informal acting company and, as a child, 
Paltrow spent many summers in this Berkshire mountain community and 
has appeared in other productions in past seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``As You Like It'' runs through Aug. 15.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Tests New, High-Speed Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) -- Even at a standstill, the silver,  
bullet-nosed train looks out of place on this remote, brush-covered 
prairie, where the horizon is broken only by the far-off silhouette 
of Pikes Peak and an occasional antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	And when it moves, under the close watch of a group of  
engineers, it becomes a gray streak flashing through the landscape 
of sagebrush and sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually it will go 150 mph, making it the fastest train in  
the country. And that's not even its top speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had it up to 167 mph a couple weeks ago,'' Ernie Chance,  
Amtrak's assistant chief mechanic officer, said from inside the 
engineer's quarters. ``And it felt like she still had more power in 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She'' is one of 20 high-speed electric trains named Acelas  
that Amtrak is having built as part of a $2 billion project. The 
Acelas, unveiled in March, will be used along routes connecting 
Boston, New York and Washington, with the first passenger runs 
scheduled for November or December. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new trains is being tested for up to 16 hours a day  
on a 13-mile track at the Transportation Technology Center, which 
sprawls across 52 square miles of land about 25 miles northeast of 
Pueblo. The center is a subsidiary of the Association of American 
Railroads, representing North American freight railroads and 
Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remote and we can do a lot of testing with relative  
secrecy,'' said Keith Hawthorne, the center's vice president of 
technology. ``Our customers like that; they want to be able to iron 
out their problems in private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Acelas are designed to tilt gently as the trains rush around  
curves. That doesn't promote speed as much as it prevents 
centrifugal force from throwing the passengers around. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the tilt mechanism deactivated for a test run at a  
mere 110 mph, the ride on the special test track is much smoother 
and freer of vibration than Amtrak's existing Metroliner service in 
the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no need to grab the seats for balance while walking down  
the train's aisle. Filling in a New York Times crossword puzzle is 
easy -- if you know the answers -- and the quiet ride makes 
conversation easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bistro car will have standup tables with pedestal seating  
like a bar,'' said Chance. ``With this ride, especially with the 
tilt-system on, it should be as comfortable for people to stand up 
as it is to sit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cars of the train that is being tested have been transformed  
into traveling laboratories, filled with computers, printers and 
miles of cable. A dozen engineers perform tests on the train's 
propulsion, endurance, acceleration, energy consumption, wheel wear 
and ride quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day we have a problem that we fix the next day,'' said  
Gilles Losier, the supervisor of quality assurance and testing for 
Bombardier Inc., the train's Montreal-based manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The most difficult problem encountered so far occurred when the  
wheel sets began shaking from side to side at speeds of 130 mph to 
145 mph. The wheels, a French design, were reshaped to fit more 
closely with the American-made track. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, old tracks on the Washington-New York line will limit  
the Acelas to 135 mph, Chance said. That is 10 mph faster than the 
Metroliners run now, and will slice 16 minutes off the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tracks are reconfigured, the trains will be able to  
run at 150 mph, cutting an additional 13 minutes off the trip, said 
John Wolf, an Amtrak spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-Boston leg will require new overhead electrical  
wires in addition to track improvements. Wolf says Amtrak hopes to 
trim that trip from 4 1/2 hours to three hours.

<HEADLINE> Harry `The Hat' Walker Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Harry ``The Hat'' Walker, who led the  
National League in hitting in 1947 and got the deciding hit in the 
1946 World Series, died Sunday from complications of a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who said earlier this year that he was 80 although the  
Baseball Encyclopedia said he was born in 1916, had been 
hospitalized since July 16, University Hospital spokesman Hank 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, a left-handed hitter nicknamed for his habit of  
adjusting his cap between pitches, had a .296 average in a 22-year 
pro career, including 11 seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent eight years with the Cardinals and also played for the  
Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds, mostly as 
an outfielder. He appeared in three World Series (1942, 1943 and 
1946) and two All-Star Games (1943 and 1947). 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 7 of the 1946 World Series, Walker hit a double to  
left-center in the bottom of the eighth, and Enos Slaughter scored 
all the way from first, giving the Cardinals a 4-3 victory over the 
Boston Red Sox and the series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's best year was in 1947, when he batted .363 while  
playing 130 games for Philadelphia and 10 games with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 20 years as a manager, including major league stints  
with the Cardinals (1955), Pittsburgh Pirates (1965-67) and Houston 
Astros (1968-72). For the next six years, he worked in various 
capacities for the Cardinals' organization, including hitting 
coach, minor league farm director and scout. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker then came to Alabama-Birmingham, where he became the  
first head coach for the baseball program, from 1979-1986. He led 
the Blazers to Sun Belt Conference North Division titles in 1981-82 
and had an eight-year record of 211-171. Walker finished his UAB 
career with four consecutive 20-plus victory seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Baseball Encyclopedia, he was born Oct. 22,  
1916, in Pascagoula, Miss., the son of the first Alabamian to go to 
the majors -- Ewart ``Dixie'' Walker, who pitched for Washington in 
1909. 
</P>
<P>
	He told UAB officials in April that the record books are wrong,  
and that he was actually born in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Walker's uncle, Ernie Walker, played for the St. Louis  
Browns, and brother Fred ``Dixie'' Walker was a star outfielder in 
the NL and AL. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral was scheduled at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Kilgroe Funeral  
Home in his home of Leeds, Ala., with burial following in Cedar 
Grove Cemetery. Walker is survived by his wife, Dot; three 
daughters; and four grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Woods, Dion Pitch In on Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- More than 1,000 fans turned out to help golf  
star Tiger Woods raise money for his foundation benefiting 
underprivileged young people, and his biggest fan -- singer Celine 
Dion -- shared the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not only the number one golfer, he's the number one human  
being,'' Dion said of Woods during her 30-minute performance at 
Tiger Jam II. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion's voice broke with emotion as she told the audience how her  
husband and manager Rene Angelil -- also a big Woods fan -- had been 
diagnosed with skin cancer four months ago. Since then, Angelil has 
had the cancer removed from his neck and is undergoing radiation 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion said Woods called three times in the next three weeks to  
inquire about Angelil's progress and boost his morale. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's event included an auction of a dozen items that  
raised $242,500 for the California-based Tiger Woods Foundation, 
Inc. Fetching the most money was a round of golf with Woods at his 
home course in Orlando, Fla. that went for $65,000.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Probes Paducah Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Workers at an Energy Department  
uranium-enrichment plant in Kentucky will be subjects of a medical 
review following published allegations that thousands of employees 
were unwittingly exposed to plutonium and other highly radioactive 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday that he ordered the  
immediate study of current workers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion 
Plant and a study of workers' medical history since the 1950s as 
additions to a program already monitoring the health of some former 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's announcement followed a report in Sunday's  
Washington Post that the Paducah case differed from other nuclear 
contamination incidents because workers there did not know they 
were handling plutonium. Instead, they thought they were dealing 
only with much less-potent uranium, which they were enriching for 
commercial nuclear fuel, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe a great debt to the workforce at Paducah, and we are  
fully investigating these issues,'' Richardson said in a statement. 
An inspection team sent to the plant in June found no imminent 
threat to public health, worker safety or the environment, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsuspecting workers inhaled the more dangerous radiation in the  
form of plutonium-laced dust brought into the plant for 23 years, 
beginning in the mid-1950s, as part of a government experiment to 
recycle used nuclear reactor fuel, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't know how my husband suffered,'' Clara Harding  
told The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky. Her husband, Joe, died 
in 1980 of illnesses he contended were related to his exposure to 
radiation at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Harding said her husband sometimes came home with dust on  
his work clothes and would say: ``It's the stuff I wade in. I work 
in it. I eat it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After fighting the government in court for a decade, seeking  
compensation for her husband's death, she said she ended up with 
about $9,000 in workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing its own investigation and sealed court documents, the  
Post said radioactive contaminants from the plant spilled into 
ditches and eventually seeped into creeks, a state-owned wildlife 
area and private wells. It said plant workers contended in court 
documents that radioactive waste also was deliberately dumped into 
nearby fields, abandoned buildings and a landfill not licensed for 
hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he has ordered an investigation to determine  
what happened, who was responsible and how such problems could be 
prevented. He is also asking the National Academy of Science's 
Institute of Medicine to look at the relationship between hazardous 
exposures and illnesses in workers at Paducah and other Energy 
Department sites.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Mixed in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Monday,  
partly on heightened tension over a possible North Korean missile 
test. Japanese stocks opened mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.26 yen in early trading, up 0.98 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
114.73 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 82.38  
points, or 0.48 percent, to 17,166.62 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 273.95 points, or 1.58 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the greenback gained ground against the  
yen after North Korea said Sunday it would ignore U.S. appeals and 
warnings to scrap an expected missile launch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the strongest statements yet from North Korea,  
which Western military analysts say is poised to test an advanced 
version of a ballistic missile that it fired over Japan last year. 
North Korea claimed it had launched a satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan said it might respond to a missile test by severing one of  
the impoverished Communist country's only sources of hard cash -- 
money sent from Koreans living in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar is often regarded as a safe haven in times of  
international unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strength also derived from further buying among  
investors adjusting positions after the currency saw firm support 
despite hints of inflationary fears in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the U.S. jobs data, inflationary fears were triggered,  
but the dollar showed extraordinary strength around 114.30 yen,'' 
said Hideaki Inoue, manager of the international treasury division 
at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department reported employers added a  
larger-than-expected 310,000 jobs to their payrolls in July and 
that average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, 
rose 3.98 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.75 yen, up from  
122.90 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index opened slightly higher  
after losing 4.3 percent over the course of last week on fears of 
rising U.S. interest rates and of a strengthening yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar's rise back above 115 yen supported sentiment  
Monday, and share prices are seen as having already factored in 
expectations for an increase in U.S. interest rates, market players 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.79 points  
to close Friday at 10,714.03. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.25 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,420.43. 
The TOPIX closed down 10.34 points, or 0.72 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unquoted in early trading. On Friday, its yield settled at 
1.8050 percent and its price stood at 99.95 yen.

	GORDON, Texas (AP) -- A chemical car of a Union Pacific freight  
train that derailed spilled a flammable liquid for about eight 
hours before cleanup crews contained the leak.

	There were no injuries and no evacuations were ordered after 22  
of the freight train's 102 cars derailed Saturday, UP spokesman 
Mark Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	All but six cars that jumped the tracks were empty. The loads  
that derailed included talc, liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum 
distillates and plastic pellets. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaking car carried about 18,000 gallons petroleum  
distillates but it was not immediately known how much of the thick, 
tar-like liquid had spilled, Davis said. Distillates are petroleum 
liquids, such as kerosene, that are produced during the oil 
distillation process. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, pulled by four locomotives, was headed from El Paso  
to Fort Worth when it jumped the track about 3:55 p.m. in Palo 
Pinto County in west central Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	A small grass fire that started after the derailment was quickly  
extinguished, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the derailment was being investigated.

<HEADLINE> Briggs Might Next Fight Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY (AP) -- Shannon Briggs' big plans for a fight with  
Mike Tyson remained in place but only barely after the heavyweight 
survived with a 10-round draw against Francois Botha Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, a 3-to-1 underdog, unleashed a blistering 10th-round  
assault that left Briggs on the verge of going down. All three 
judges awarded Botha a 10-8 round, enabling him to obtain a 94-94 
score on two judges' cards; the third card had it 95-92 in Botha's 
favor. The result was a draw by the majority decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who landed numerous unanswered rights to the head in the  
final round, was unhappy with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won the fight,'' said the 30-year-old native of  
South Africa. ``But when it came to New Jersey, I figured I had to 
knock him out. The power that his manager has with the New Jersey 
(Boxing) Commission made it obvious to me I wasn't going to win a 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs' manager, Marc Roberts, said negotiations for a  
Briggs-Tyson bout, possibly for Dec. 11, are underway. A loss to 
Botha would have denied Briggs a chance at Tyson, and a career-high 
payday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy gave me a lot of trouble tonight,'' Briggs said. ``I  
thought I could just walk through his punches because I thought his 
power was not all that. I thought I would knock him out because his 
chin was not all that. But he was cagey, and he was very slick. I 
guess I underestimated him,'' Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned his attention to Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he called here during the fight and said, `Let's get  
it on,''' Briggs said of his fellow Brooklyn, N.Y., native. ``It 
would be great to have that fight, especially in New York. I'm 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he finished strongly, Botha had trouble early penetrating  
Briggs' 7-inch reach advantage. Botha's offense was non-existent 
for the first two rounds before he picked up his body assault in 
round three. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha appeared ready to take control after a big seventh round  
but a break in round eight gave Briggs a chance he capitalized on. 
Botha's mouthpiece fell out, providing a stop in the action that 
gave Briggs a chance to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	When the fight resumed, Briggs jumped on Botha, landing a  
combination capped by a left hook to the head to knock him down. 
Briggs, who was losing the round, instead emerged with a 10-8 
verdict on all three scorecards for a crucial turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw was the first for each fighter. Briggs is 31-2-1 with  
25 knockouts, while Botha is 39-2-1 with 24 knockouts. An announced 
crowd of 5,150 watched the bout at Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Discusses Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Bill Bradley says he might not be running  
for president if he had not left elective office nearly three years 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two years reminded me of how big the country is, and  
how diverse it is, and how rich it is in so many ways that 
sometimes, if you are in Washington, you don't always appreciate 
it,'' said the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, who is 
now running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'd be doing this if I had not left the Senate  
in January of 1997,'' he told reporters at Portland International 
Airport Sunday en route to a fund-raising function in Camas, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living in times of multiple change, in terms of  
globalization of the economy, of technological change, ... military 
threat changes and changes in the structure of our families. I came 
to a deeper understanding of all those during my two years out,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he isn't bothered by his relatively low recognition  
rate among voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 45 to 50 percent of the people in the country don't  
really know me. That's a good base to start from, because 50 
percent know me. That's why we have to raise the money, and that's 
why, in the fall, when we lay out health issues, people will get to 
know me. And I'm sure that by the primary season, which is 
February, that there will be far more than 50 percent. The good 
thing is that those people who know me seem to like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was surprised, but not overly concerned about  
President Clinton's support for the candidacy of the Democratic 
front-runner, Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Endorsements are important,'' he said. ``But I think,  
ultimately, people decide who they are going to vote for based on 
one question -- and that is who they trust with their life, who they 
trust with their job, who they trust has a view of life that is 
remotely similar to their own. And that will not be answered by 
surrogates. That will be answered by the candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Marching Band Ban Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A ban on American and Japanese marching  
band members performing at the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony 
will be reversed this week, Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan devised by Olympic officials, the bands' contractor  
-- American-based World Projects Corporation -- also would be offered 
a substantial sum to cover legal costs, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper reports the Sydney organizing committee will be asked  
to approve a new international band comprising ``hundreds'' more 
Australians and more players from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans and Japanese would be offered no less than the  
seven minutes they were originally promised in the Sept. 15, 2000 
opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The last-ditch bid to resolve the marching band crisis would be  
finalized at a special meeting of the board of the Sydney games 
organizer SOCOG on Wednesday, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Sydney Olympics chief executive Sandy Hollway tried  
for a compromise with World Projects Corporation, which has started 
legal action against SOCOG for reneging on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court case is due to resume in Sydney on Aug. 16.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Crime Drop, Legal Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An unpublished study circulating among economists  
and criminal-law experts suggests that the legalization of abortion 
in the early 1970s has contributed to a drop in crime, the Chicago 
Tribune reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several academics and lawyers called the research compelling and  
provocative, but others are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers argue that many women whose children would have  
been most likely to commit crimes as young adults instead chose to 
abort their pregnancies. Because of that, a disproportionate number 
of would-be criminals in the 1990s were not born in the 1970s, the 
professors conclude. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors also conclude that unwanted children are most likely  
to commit crimes as adults, and those most likely to give birth to 
unwanted children are teenagers, minorities and the poor. Those are 
also the people most likely to choose abortion, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Levitt, a University of Chicago economist, and John  
Donohue III, a Stanford University law professor, said their 
analysis suggests that legalized abortion may account for as much 
as half of the overall crime drop in the United States from 1991 
and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper, ``Legalized Abortion and Crime,'' has not been  
submitted for publication in any academic journal, the newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Richard Posner, chief judge of the 7th U.S. Court of  
Appeals in Chicago, called it ``a striking, original, rigorous and 
persuasive -- although not conclusive -- demonstration of the 
commonsensical point that unwanted children are quite likely not to 
turn out to be the best citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Douglas Baird, a University of Chicago law professor who  
attended a workshop on the paper, expressed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would find this paper much more plausible if they found  
abortion affected education rates, unemployment rate'' and other 
aspects of society, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt and Donohue say their research was an attempt to  
determine what causes reduced crime, and was not an endorsement of 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said it would be difficult to confirm the relationship  
between abortion and crime definitively, but added: ``I think we've 
amassed enough evidence to make people take the issue seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that states with high abortion rates in the  
1970s experienced greater drops in crime in the 1990s than states 
with lower abortion rates, even when other factors that influence 
crime -- income, racial composition and incarceration rates -- were 
taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life  
Committee in Washington, D.C., called the thesis bizarre, saying it 
doesn't present a convincing argument for abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights  
Action League declined to comment until organization members had a 
chance to study the paper.

<HEADLINE> Countess Diana Wins at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Countess Diana, the juvenile filly  
champion of 1997, raced to a frontrunning 5 3/4-length victory at 
Saratoga on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Timed in 1:16:3 for 6 1/2 furlongs, Countess Diana won her first  
race since last Sept. 12 when she was fourth in Belmont Park's 
Gazelle Handicap. She was winless in four starts as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Patrick Byrne in her championship year and then By  
Bill Mott, Countess Diana is now handled by Mary Jo Lohmeier. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner paid $4, $3.80 amd $2.80. Memory Call paid $12.60 and  
$4.80 with Cottage Garden $3.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Lohmeier confessed to having been ``a little nervous about the  
wet track. She won the Spinaway on a ``good'' track,'' she 
recalled. ``It was extremely rewarding. I think it was the first 
time I cried watching a horse cross the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was training great. It was just a question of whether,  
mentally, she was going to be back in the game or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lohmeier said Countess Diana was nominated for the  
seven-furlong, $200,000 Ballerina on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main goal is to stretch her out,'' the trainer said.  
``Nominations were due yesterday, and I didn't want to have her not 
nominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Lohmeier's first win at Saratoga.

<HEADLINE> D.C. United Tops Mutiny in Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tom Presthus made two saves in the shootout,  
including one in the final round, and Jaime Moreno scored the 
deciding goal to give D.C. United a shootout 3-2 victory over the 
Tampa Bay Mutiny Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United outscored the Mutiny 3-2 in the shootout after the  
teams deadlocked 2-2 in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Ralston and Josh Keller both scored for Tampa Bay, while  
A.J. Wood and Roy Lassiter scored for D.C. United. The shootout was 
tied at 2 after three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Presthus then stopped Raul Diaz Arce's shot, and Moreno put a  
soft shot past goalie Scott Garlick that rolled slowly into the 
goal. Jorge Salcedo tried to tie it for Tampa Bay, but Presthus 
smothered his shot to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Musa Shannon had a goal and an assist for Tampa Bay as the  
Mutiny took a 2-1 lead in the second half. He scored his team-high 
11th of the season in the 40th minute to tie the score 1-1 and set 
up Steve Trittschuh's second goal of the season early in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 52nd minute, Dominic Kinnear sent a pass to Shannon, who  
redirected it into the middle, and Trittschuh put the ball into the 
net while standing in-between four D.C. United defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Trittschuh later was given a red card in the 73rd minute for  
dangerous play after tackling Moreno from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United tied it in the 85th minute when Wood headed in Marco  
Etcheverry's corner kick from in front. It was Wood's career-high 
sixth goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry, playing his first game with D.C. United since June  
after playing with the Bolivian national team and then being 
injured, scored the game's first goal, heading a Lassiter pass in 
during the 17th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay tied it in the 40th minute when Carlos Valderrama sent  
a ball into the box that Shannon dove and headed in.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 196 Years for Molesting Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A former sheriff's deputy once lauded as  
a hero after being shot in the face in the line of duty was 
sentenced to 196 years in prison for molesting a 7-year-old boy 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	James Jewsbury received the maximum possible sentence after  
investigators testified that he had molested dozens of children 
going back 35 years, including his son and daughter, their friends, 
his foster children and kids he coached in youth sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only way that society in general, and young  
children specifically, can be protected from him,'' said Superior 
Court Judge Victor Person. 
</P>
<P>
	Person imposed three consecutive 25 years-to-life sentences,  
doubled them under the state's three-strikes law, and added to that 
a sentence of 46 years and four months. There is no possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewsbury, 57, was sentenced June 30.  
</P>
<P>
	Jewsbury left the San Bernardino County sheriff's office in 1978  
after he was shot in the face while responding to a domestic 
violence call. The wounds destroyed his right eye and left him 
scarred and brain damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Charles Maple claimed his client began  
molesting children as a result of brain damage from the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators say he had been molesting children 15 years  
earlier and the brain damage only made him less careful about the 
victims he chose.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plan To Avoid Shutdown Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans say they're willing  
to fund the government at current levels for as much as a year 
until a budget agreement with the White House can be worked out, 
but they plan to pressure President Clinton into signing their $792 
billion tax cut package. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, bashed the GOP tax cut in a speech Sunday to  
the nation's governors in St. Louis, saying the proposal would 
automatically trigger billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare, 
veterans and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But he professed optimism that a compromise can be reached. ``I  
am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about the 
prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am determined to try 
to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget talks and tax cuts are linked politically as each  
party strives for support from voters next year, when the 
presidency and House control hinge on the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the government shut down -- twice during the 1995  
budget standoff -- public blame landed squarely on the Republicans, 
and the party is eager to avoid a repetition if current talks 
collapse before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders made clear they would be willing to continue to fund  
the government at current levels for as long as a year while an 
agreement can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way to avoid a train wreck,'' Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week,'' alluding to a 
possible shutdown. ``There's no need for that sort of thing. And 
it's irresponsible, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., suggested that stopgap spending legislation,  
known as a continuing resolution, could keep the government running 
``for two weeks or a month or for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House's third-ranking Republican, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,  
has called the such a resolution ``a little trick'' that would put 
Clinton at risk of being blamed for a shutdown if he vetoed it -- as 
Republicans were during the 1995 shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	On tax cuts, meanwhile, voters might have to wait for a break on  
their tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (Clinton) vetoes it, then maybe we'll have to wait for a  
real president that wants to give the American family a tax 
relief,'' DeLay said Saturday on CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; 
Shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton might reconsider his position on the tax cuts as  
Republicans sell it to voters during the current congressional 
summer break, GOP lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that public opinion is going to come out strong for  
this package as it's better understood and we believe the president 
will respond to that,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, 
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton believes the GOP cuts, to be paid with a projected $1  
trillion surplus over the next decade, are too large and endanger 
the nation's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	He told state leaders Sunday at the National Governors'  
Association meeting in St. Louis that the GOP tax cut proposal 
would automatically trigger billions of dollars in spending cuts 
from current programs, including $31.8 billion from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the looming fight is sensitive for both parties as  
the 2000 elections near, with control of the White House and the 
House at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, DeLay has said, planned to spend next year's $14  
billion annual surplus all along, to force Clinton to pay for his 
spending programs from the Social Security surplus, which both 
parties have promised to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay has made no secret he would relish such a scenario, saying  
post-veto budget negotiations would occur with Clinton ``on his 
knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all GOP leaders were as strident.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he shared that vision of a politically weakened  
president during budget talks, Armey said: ``No, of course not. We 
are all going to be sitting at the table together.''

<HEADLINE> Nuke Reactor Vessel Finishes Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A decommissioned 1,000-ton nuclear  
reactor vessel finished its voyage up the Columbia River on Sunday, 
docking safely just miles from a burial site for radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
	It took about 36 hours for tugs to bring the vessel, emptied of  
its uranium fuel, up 270 miles of river from the dismantled Trojan 
Nuclear Plant west of Portland, Ore. That included a two-hour 
precautionary stop early Sunday at Pasco to wait for daylight on 
the last 10-mile stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The voyage ended at 9 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	``It went very well,'' said Steve Nichols, project manager for  
Portland General Electric, the utility decommissioning the largest 
commercial reactor ever taken off line in the United States. ``It's 
been very routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The river voyage past Portland made it the first commercial  
reactor of that size and level of contamination to pass so near a 
major American city, according to the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	No demonstrators were on hand when the barge docked at the  
nearby river port of Benton, part of a region of south-central 
Washington that has been closely tied to nuclear development since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a handful of people stood atop a bluff a couple  
hundreds yards away with video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	From Benton, the reactor vessel was to be towed about 30 miles,  
partially on public highway, to its burial site at the federal 
Hanford Nuclear Reservation. It was mounted on a 16-axle trailer 
with 320 wheels to support its enormous weight. 
</P>
<P>
	PGE already had shipped Trojan's contaminated steam generators  
upriver to Hanford since 1995, and the Navy often ships reactors 
from submarines and cruisers up the Columbia for burial at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it no longer contains its uranium fuel, the Trojan  
reactor vessel contains 15 times as much radioactivity as those 
objects, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after being filled with concrete and encased in  
6-inch-thick steel, the reactor was considered safe for shipment. 
Workers handling it wear no more protection than a hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojan plant operated for 16 years, generating enough  
electricity to supply all of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was shut down in 1993, two decades earlier than planned,  
after a series of problems including a faulty safety system that 
drew federal fines, an accidental release of radioactive gases and 
cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 800 spent but highly radioactive uranium fuel rod  
assemblies removed from the reactor over the years remain in 
storage at the Trojan site.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns of Tax-Cut Aftermath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- President Clinton, seeking allies in his battle  
against the Republican tax-cut plan, warned the nation's governors 
Sunday that the $792 billion package would trigger ``huge cuts'' in 
Medicare, farm programs and other spending critical to their 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a new attack on the 10-year, tax-cut bill passed by  
Congress last week, the president said Washington faces ``a 
generational challenge'': how to divide projected surpluses among 
tax cuts, debt reduction and popular federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we ought to blow it,'' he said. ``And if I can  
stop it, I will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that Clinton and fellow Democrats would  
say anything to avoid shrinking government. ``The president wants 
more money so he can spend more money,'' Republican Sen. Don 
Nickles of Oklahoma told the National Governors' Association, just 
ahead of the president at the lectern. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Nickles left the door open to compromise, amid fears  
that the stalemate could result in another government shutdown. 
``I'm not nearly as pessimistic as other are about the process of 
reaching an agreement,'' Clinton said. ``I am determined to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He avoided confrontational language on the tax issue, and  
softened a planned critique of state health insurance programs for 
children. He chose instead to appeal for help and support from the 
state leaders. Then the former Arkansas governor mingled for more 
than 30 minutes with state executives from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	He posed for pictures with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a  
former wrestler. They chatted about life in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton and Nickles made their parties' tax pitches to the  
governors, operatives for the White House and the Republican 
leadership in Congress hit the television news shows in a bitterly 
partisan debate that could shape the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that the surplus is large enough to protect  
Social Security, Medicare and return money to taxpayers. Clinton 
wants a $250 billion tax cut, keeping more in Washington to reduce 
the debt and shore up Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing that we have to do is get people to understand  
that tax reduction relief is possible,'' House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, of Texas, said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget director, Jack Lew, accused Republicans of  
resorting to a ``cynical charade'' and ``a fiscal hoax'' to sell 
their tax cuts. His office released an analysis that said GOP tax 
cuts would trigger across-the-board spending reductions under a 
1990 budget law. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Medicare would be reduced by $32 billion over five years  
and crop insurance would lose $19 billion. Spending for veterans, 
day care and state programs that cater the needy would be 
eliminated or cut, said the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said there would be ``huge cuts in all these things.''  
After a lengthy explanation of the budget process, Clinton said, 
``To me, this is not politics. This is arithmetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't seem to change any minds. Democratic governors, such  
as Tom Vilsack of Iowa, said they were skeptical of the GOP plans. 
Republican governors formed a united front behind Republicans in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this isn't a good time to cuts taxes, when is it a good  
time?'' Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia said. 
</P>
<P>
	While making their case on taxes, Nickles and Clinton tackled  
other political problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles hoped his appearance would end an angry dispute between  
the GOP governors and Republican leaders in Congress over a 
proposal to seek welfare money from the states to pay for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you -- at least from this senator and I believe on  
behalf of all Republican leaders -- that's not going to happen. The 
(welfare) money will stay intact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governors were angry at not being consulted.  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert declined several requests to address 
the governors, raising suspicions that the issue wasn't settled. 
Worried they still had no such commitment form House Republicans, 
the governors were putting together a harshly worded resolution 
urging Congress not to take back the welfare money. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his remarks were more tame than aides had predicted,  
Clinton upset many governors, particularly Republicans, by 
questioning their work to get low-income children enrolled in a 
federal health insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.3 million children have been enrolled in the program.  
Clinton said states should shoot for 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican governors complained that the Clinton administration  
has been slow to give them approval to develop health insurance 
programs. And they said only 2.5 million children are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just grandstanding,'' grumbled Republican Gov. John  
Engler of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP governors said they suspected Clinton was making  
trouble for a colleague -- Gov. George Bush of Texas, the leading 
Republican candidate for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has the second-largest percentage of uninsured children,  
according to Census Bureau figures from 1996 to 1998. The figures 
were widely distributed by the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Facts About Oil Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of the case alleging unfair trade practices involving  
oil imports: 

</P>
<P>
	PETITION: Filed by about a dozen small independent oil producers  
organized under an Okahoma-based coalition called Save Domestic Oil 
Inc. Petition is supported by many other independents, but opposed 
by the major international oil companies. 

</P>
<P>
	CHARGES: That government-oil companies in Venezuela, Mexico,  
Saudi Arabia and Iraq sold oil in the U.S. market at ``less than 
normal value'' and that the government's subsidized such sales, to 
the economic detriment of the U.S. industry. These countries 
account for 60 percent of U.S. oil imports. 

</P>
<P>
	THE LAW: The anti-dumping laws enacted in 1930 prohibit selling  
imported products at lower prices than they are sold in home 
countries or below average cost of production, and prohibit 
governments from subsidizing production or export of such products. 

</P>
<P>
	PROCEDURES: Jurisdiction is divided between the Commerce  
Department's International Trade Association, and an independent 
agency, the International Trade Commission (ITC). 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is filed with Commerce, which decides if the group  
has legal standing, whether the product is being sold in violation 
of the law, and whether an action should be initiated. 
</P>
<P>
	If the case is accepted, the independent ITC then must decides  
whether the U.S. industry, or the portion of the industry subject 
to the petition, has been harmed economically as a result. The 
Commerce agency then decides what tariffs or penalties should be 
imposed. 

</P>
<P>
	APPEALS: If Commerce decides initially to reject the case,  
petitioners may appeal to the Court of International Trade, a 
process that can take several years.

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Rolling Toward First Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Just call Dale Jarrett Mr. Consistency. If  
he keeps it up, pretty soon you can call him Champ. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett dominated the Brickyard 400 on Saturday at the  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, leading 116 of 160 laps on the way to 
his fourth victory of the season. That also built his margin over 
runner-up Mark Martin in the Winston Cup standings to 274 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brickyard is only the latest example of the way Jarrett and  
his Robert Yates Racing team have performed during the 1999 season. 
The victory gave him 16 top-five finishes in 20 races this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, it's been Jarrett, the son of a two-time NASCAR  
champion, who has been doing the chasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot more fun being where we're at,'' said Jarrett, who  
has yet to win a series title and has finished third, second and 
third in the points in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in second and third, you have to rely on someone  
else having a problem for you to gain points. There were many days 
in the last couple of years when we finished second, third, fourth 
or fifth, and the problem was that the guy in front of us, leading 
the points, was the guy finishing first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, that guy was Jeff Gordon. But Gordon, a  
three-time series champion overall, is sixth in the points this 
year and, like everyone else, watched helplessly as Jarrett ran 
away with Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's very, very tough right now,'' Gordon said. ``It's  
like they were just biding their time, getting those top fives 
early in the season and, all of a sudden, everything is clicking 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they're getting wins.''  
</P>
<P>
	All four of Jarrett's victories -- matching Gordon and Jeff  
Burton for the season-high -- have come in the last 10 events. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, who followed Jarrett across the finish line  
Saturday -- nearly half a straightaway behind the winner's No. 88 
Ford Taurus -- said, ``It's awfully tough to keep up with him every 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He drives this track so well. I followed him lap after lap  
after lap and he doesn't vary an inch, it seems. Those guys are 
just clicking on all cylinders right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just doing the best we can to keep up with him right  
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief for the past three seasons,  
says there are good reasons why the Yates team is racing with 
confidence these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've stepped up our program,'' the son of longtime  
crew chief and team manager Buddy Parrott said. ``The biggest thing 
is the team. This isn't about Dale or me or Robert. It's about all 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
	``And behind us there's about 60 or 70 guys back at the shop,  
and that's what working. There's no single thing that you can put 
your finger on. ... Right now, everything is going good. We've got 
a lot of racing luck, and you just got to keep doing things like 
we're doing and things like we did here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who is now a two-time Brickyard champion, said he and  
his team are going to make it tough for anybody to catch them in 
the final 14 races this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see the races start counting down and they realize that  
their time is running out a bit,'' he said. ``It's a lot more fun 
to be in control of your destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that I have a good team, and they've done their job  
totally in every respect this year. That's been the key. We've just 
been there week in and week out.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Corps Probes Wetlands Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has retreated  
from its policy of enforcing the laws that protect the nation's 
wetlands, The Boston Globe reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, the Corps has inspected 40 percent fewer wetlands  
areas for possible violations, according to the Globe. Over roughly 
the same period, the agency accepted more applications to develop 
swamps, marshes and streams, according to the Globe's review of 
records from the Corps' 37 field offices. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, for example, the Corps rejected 8.8 percent of  
development requests; in 1998, it dismissed 3.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also since 1992, orders to restore illegally damaged wetlands  
have fallen from 283 to 109, and field inspections have dropped 
from 8,149 to 5,141 in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said  
Magi Shapiro, a former Corps employee who said she left the agency 
rather than approve development projects she felt should not be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A program without enforcement is an invitation to break the  
law without consequences,'' Shapiro said. Her advocacy group, 
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, provided the 
Globe with the Corps records. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Corps officials, however, insist the decline in  
inspections and enforcement actions is not cause for alarm. They 
say the trend is partly due to fewer projects by businesses and 
others that would damage wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we've substantially increased environmental  
protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the 
headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say cuts in the number of regulatory staff -- from  
1,150 to 1,050 in the last five years -- have made them become more 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, more than 100,000 acres of wetlands are filled in or  
destroyed by development in the United States, killing wildlife and 
destroying an important protection from floodwaters and trap for 
pollutants that might otherwise reach tap water. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1972, the Corps, along with the Environmental Protection  
Agency, has been responsible for protecting the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Corps employees say that recent budget and staff cuts, however,  
and a message from the top, have made them more accommodating to 
developers. At one office, staff were urged in a memo to avoid 
time-consuming, costly enforcement actions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Corps officials say the Clinton Administration is committed  
to preserving the nation's wetlands and has a goal to create 
100,000 more acres of wetlands than are destroyed by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say only modest resources have been given to the Corps  
and the EPA, and the Corps has begun to transfer its 
responsibilities elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	At the New England Corps a separate enforcement division has  
been eliminated and more cases have been transferred to the EPA's 
Boston office, where there is only one full-time inspector and one 
part-time staff member. 
</P>
<P>
	Studet said the workload shift to the EPA makes sense, however,  
because the EPA has broader enforcement powers and a larger legal 
team.

<HEADLINE> Web Technology Settling in Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAYMOND, Maine (AP) -- Heads up, campers. Look this way, bunch up  
together, and smile for the camera. We want to show mom and dad 
you're having a good time! 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Camp Pinehurst, where director Jack Curtis has a new  
job: cyberphotographer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns of poisoning the rustic camp experience with  
high-tech gadgetry, more and more camps are using computers and the 
Internet to offer pictures of happy campers for their parents back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	For Curtis, it's both good fun and good marketing. And it  
reassures parents like Pat Zapert of Dracut, Mass., who logged onto 
the Internet to make sure that her 12-year-old son, Brian, was 
having fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allowed us to see that he was alive and well and  
obviously enjoying himself,'' she said. ``I used it virtually every 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the photos showed Brian helping throw a friend in the  
water as a birthday gag. Another showed him eating strawberry 
shortcake at a Fourth of July party. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos also showed the boys resting after a Sunday afternoon  
hike up Rattlesnake Mountain near the camp in southwest Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital photos, which Curtis posts daily on Camp Pinehurt's  
World Wide Web site, serve the purpose of both promoting the camp 
and boosting attendance, he says. If nothing else, they have cut 
down on the number of phone calls from anxious parents. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, summer camp is often a child's first extended trip  
away from home, and the rite of passage can be rougher on parents 
than on the children, camp directors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first summer is really, really hard, as a parent, because  
you don't have any sense of what your child is doing up there,'' 
said Lisa Samel, also of Dracut, whose 12-year-old son Alex just 
returned from camp. 
</P>
<P>
	For Curtis, the photos have become part of the daily routine,  
like getting the kids fed and monitoring activities like hiking, 
target practice and swimming or canoeing on Crescent Lake. He loads 
the photographs directly into a computer using a program that lets 
him update the Web site without arcane computer codes. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen how many other camps will follow suit.  
</P>
<P>
	Don Bulens, president and chief executive officer of Trellix  
Corp., which makes the program used by Curtis, is betting on 
growing demand for Web sites among small businesses, including 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ed Andrews, a former executive director of the American  
Camping Association, said the Web may have limited appeal in an 
industry that sometimes bans devices as simple as portable radios. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some camp directors feel that the incursion of technology into  
what is supposed to be a respite from city life is inappropriate,'' 
said Andrews, a consultant to the Maine Youth Camping Association. 
</P>
<P>
	At some camps, old-fashioned networking is all that's needed to  
keep the kids coming, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp Wawenock, on Sebago Lake, is holding off on setting up a  
Web site since it relies on word-of-mouth advertising, camp 
co-director Patricia Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've chosen to go slowly trying to decide whether it's a  
marketing tool that is appropriate with us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other camps are leaping ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Davidson, assistant director of the American Camping  
Association's New England office, said there are all types of 
cyber-activity at camps in the region, including a Web site with 
personal identification codes to let parents keep the photos 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way of the future,'' he said. ``You're going to see  
more camps jumping on the bandwagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was one factor that helped Kodak's PictureVision Inc.  
subsidiary bring its Internet-based photo service to about 50 camps 
nationwide last summer, company spokesman Tony DeFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a tremendous increase in this kind of service  
on the Internet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For some parents, there may be no going back.  
</P>
<P>
	Marlene Recchia, of Fairfield, Conn., said she has come to  
depend on her computer to check on her 10-year-old son without 
interrupting his camp experience with a phone call from Mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather see the pictures and not bug him,'' she said.  
``Part of the thing about camping is learning to be on your own.''

<HEADLINE> Freight Train Derails, Car Leaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GORDON, Texas (AP) -- Six chemical cars of a Union Pacific  
freight train derailed Saturday afternoon and one was leaking a 
flammable liquid, while nearby cars contained volatile liquified 
petroleum gas, a railroad spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported, UP spokesman Mark Davis said in  
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	The 102-car freight train, pulled by four locomotives, was  
headed from El Paso to Fort Worth when it jumped the track about 
3:55 p.m. alongside Interstate 20 in west central Texas, 60 miles 
west of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two cars derailed, though all but six cars were empty.  
The loads that derailed included talc, liquified petroleum gas, 
petroleum distillates and plastic pellets. 
</P>
<P>
	The derailment started a small grass fire, but that was quickly  
extinguished, Davis said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Offers Tax-Cut Plan Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans on Sunday promoted a  
plan they said would delay their $792 billion tax cut while sparing 
the GOP the sort of political hits it took during government 
shutdowns tied to the budget standoff in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said they would support legislation that would keep  
the government in business, at current funding levels, for as much 
as a year, in an attempt to counter President Clinton's promised 
veto of the tax package. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way to avoid a train wreck,'' Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said on ABC's ``This Week,'' using the 
political euphemism for a shutdown when the new budget year begins 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need for that sort of thing. And it's  
irresponsible, too,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested legislation, known as a continuing resolution, that  
would keep the governing running ``for two weeks or a month or for 
a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House's third-ranking Republican, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,  
has called the measure ``a little trick'' that would put Clinton at 
risk of being blamed for a shutdown if he vetoed it -- as 
Republicans were when the government closed twice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters, DeLay said, might have to wait for a break on their tax  
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (Clinton) vetoes it, then maybe we'll have to wait for a  
real president that wants to give the American family a tax 
relief,'' Delay said Saturday on CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; 
Shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton might reconsider his position on the tax cuts as  
Republicans sell it to voters during the current congressional 
summer break, GOP lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that public opinion is going to come out strong for  
this package as it's better understood and we believe the president 
will respond to that,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, 
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton believes the GOP cuts, to be paid with a projected $1  
trillion surplus over the next decade, are too large and endanger 
the nation's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	He was telling state leaders Sunday at the National Governors  
Association meeting that a report by the White House budget office 
found the GOP plan would trigger automatic spending cuts in current 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the looming fight is sensitive for both parties as  
the 2000 elections near, with control of the White House and the 
House at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, DeLay has said, planned to spend next year's $14  
billion annual surplus all along, to force Clinton to pay for his 
spending programs from the Social Security surplus, which both 
parties have promised to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay has made no secret he would relish such a scenario, saying  
post-veto budget negotiations would occur with Clinton ``on his 
knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all GOP leaders were as strident.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he shared that vision of a politically weakened  
president during budget talks, Armey said, ``No, of course not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all going to be sitting at the table together,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans will not be there, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, told CNN's ``Late Edition'' that  
he voted against the tax cut because the projected surplus intended 
is a ``rosy'' image and ``a mirage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans show signs of backing off their tough talk.  
</P>
<P>
	In the latest indication that Republican budget strategy is in  
trouble, Lott said he would like to see a cut in the $7.4 billion 
farm aid package the House has approved -- and for which he voted 
when it passed the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Brewery Closes After 141 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- The former G. Heileman brewery officially  
closed Sunday after 141 years in the beer business, leaving more 
than 500 workers out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of workers will finish cleaning up and shipping this  
week, but manufacturing and packaging at the brewery has ended, 
said Lacey Logan, a spokeswoman for Stroh Brewery Co. of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh announced Feb. 8 it would quit the beer business. It sold  
its brands April 30 to Miller and Pabst. Local officials hunted for 
a buyer and eventually reached James Strupp and his partner, John 
Mazzuto, of Platinum Holdings, a New York-based investment company. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors on Friday reached an agreement to buy the plant  
from Stroh for $10.5 million and run it as a contract beer-maker 
and bottler. But employment will drop to about 50 when the brewery 
reopens later this year, Strupp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strupp said employment could grow to 300 by 2003. The brewery  
will be known as the City Brewery, the name it carried at its 1858 
opening, Strupp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local businesses that have done business with the brewery now  
must wait to see how they fit into the plant's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Heileman executive Randy Smith, hired by Platinum as a  
consultant and expected to serve as president and chief executive 
officer of the brewery when it reopens, said he has not yet lined 
up distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``But clearly what I call the old Heileman network, to the  
extent it still exists, would be the place for us to look first,'' 
Smith said. ``They're familiar with us, with the people here. And 
they probably would be the most anxious to take on brands from The 
City Brewery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The G. Heileman Brewing Co. ran into financial problems in the  
1990s and declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh bought the plant in 1996. The last case of Old Style was  
packaged at the plant Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum Holdings plans to produce beer for other companies and  
establish some new brands for distribution in the Upper Midwest. It 
may also produce bottled water, juice products and ethanol.

<HEADLINE> Patriots' Johnson May Miss 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITHFIELD, R.I. (AP) -- Tests have confirmed that New England  
Patriots' middle linebacker Ted Johnson suffered a ruptured left 
biceps tendon in Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage at Foxboro 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots' coach Pete Carroll said Johnson underwent a magnetic  
resonance imaging examination in Wellesley, Mass., on Sunday 
morning, and the test confirmed damage to the tendon connected to 
the biceps muscle near his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very similar to what he did last year, and it will  
require surgery,'' Carroll said, referring to Johnson's right 
biceps injury at Pittsburgh last Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said that he expects Johnson to be out of action for at  
least four months. He said he would wait until after surgery to 
determine if Johnson would be placed on injured reserve, which 
would shelve the linebacker for the entire 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year linebacker from Colorado was hurt Saturday as he  
tried to reach for rookie running back Kevin Faulk during the 
second quarter of the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances were similar to the injury Johnson incurred as  
he was trying to bring down the Steelers' Jerome Bettis, 
hyperextending his right arm in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lose a guy of great impact to our club,'' Carroll said.  
``It's a tragedy for Ted because he put so much into it, and has 
been such a diligent worker for so long. It's a crusher to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' options at middle linebacker are limited. Marty  
Moore, the last selection in the 1994 NFL Draft and a special-teams 
standout, was Johnson's backup, with second-year veteran Ron 
Merkerson in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Carroll intends to groom this year's first-round draft  
pick, Andy Katzenmoyer of Ohio State, to take over the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, the 28th pick in the first round, had been battling  
veteran Ted Bruschi for a starting outside linebacker's job. 
Bruschi will now be a starter there and make the defensive calls, 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way we'll turn our sights until we know more, and  
fortunately, we have a guy of that stature to take over that 
spot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, an inside linebacker at Ohio State, said he was  
prepared to do whatever was needed to help the Patriots' defense 
replace a player who was the team's leading tackler in two of his 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing Ted hurts us tremendously,'' Katzenmoyer said after  
Saturday's scrimmage. ``Someone has to step up and take over for 
him while he's gone. His being hurt is going to slow down the 
defense and put a hitch in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said Katzenmoyer's ``crash course'' would begin  
immediately. The Patriots open the preseason Friday night at 
Foxboro, Mass., against the Washington Redskins.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Miller Glad To Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Denver quarterback Chris Miller took  
the wrong option and then he was in orbit, sent flying by giant San 
Diego defensive end Dwight Keith. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a crucial moment for Miller, remarkably playing his first  
game since his football career was sent into a tailspin with a 
series of concussions in the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be taking those type of hits but it was pretty  
nice to take the hit and get back up and have my senses about me,'' 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos third-stringer, on the field after stints by starter  
Bubby Brister and youngster Brian Griese, dusted himself off and 
led the team out from deep in its territory. He got Denver into 
field goal range and, on the final play of the game, Jason Elam 
kicked the 35-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 20-17 win in 
Sunday's American Bowl exhibition at Sydney's Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	There were doctors who told Miller he should never return after  
he suffered multiple serious concussions in 14 months while with 
the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	For a team bidding for an unprecedented third straight Super  
Bowl championship and faced with the loss of retired John Elway, 
Miller's comeback is intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	He played 95 NFL games in seven seasons with Atlanta Falcons and  
two with the Rams. Then Miller's world caved in. He thought he 
might never play the game again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a couple of people who raised their eyebrows when they  
heard I was going to go back but I figured I had to because of the 
opportunity to play for the two-time defending world champs, and I 
wanted my kids to see me play football,'' said Miller, who 
celebrates his 34th birthday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to see the doctors and took the most extensive,  
thorough examination you can for your head and it was deemed I was 
healthy. But sure, maybe I'm a little more high risk than the 
average guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller completed 11 of 13 passes for 136 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he enjoyed playing with his kids, Dillon and Jessie, the  
past three years but missed the challenge of football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was being bored, man. I was playing basketball, playing golf  
and I still felt real athletic and I couldn't really find anything 
to fill that athletic desire,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't boring at all today, it was a lot of fun. I didn't  
do it very picturesue. I made a bad mistake by stepping out of the 
pocket when I probably could have stepped up and took the sack ... 
but I had a great time today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is now biding his time behind Brister and Griese -- but  
waiting is something he should be great at by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got two talented players in front of me,'' Miller said.  
``Bubby Brister and Brian Griese are very good quarterbacks, and my 
main goal is just to compete. Bubby'll do a great job, I hope he 
stays healthy and takes us back to the Super Bowl. But if not 
Brian'll be ready and I'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's game-winning drive showed the contrast between the  
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Harbaugh made a great start to his career at San Diego,  
taking the Chargers on a 13-play touchdown drive. No. 2 Erik Kramer 
also pleased coach Mike Riley, but Miller easily won the battle of 
the third strings over Craig Whelihan.

<HEADLINE> Workers Said Exposed to Plutonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of uranium workers were unwittingly  
exposed to plutonium and other highly radioactive metals over a 
number of years at an Energy Department plant in Kentucky, The 
Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Although similar nuclear contamination occurred at a number of  
other sites around the country in the years before worker safety 
was a top priority in U.S. industrial plants, the Post said in 
Sunday's editions that one thing setting apart the case of the 
Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant was that workers did not know they 
were handling plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they thought they were dealing only with uranium, which  
is much less potent, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsuspecting workers inhaled the more dangerous radiation in the  
form of plutonium-laced dust brought into the plant for 23 years, 
beginning in the mid-1950s, as part of a government experiment to 
recycle used nuclear reactor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and its contractors did not inform workers about  
the hazards for decades, even though employees in the 1980s began 
to notice a series of cancers, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing its own investigation and sealed court documents, the  
Post said radioactive contaminants from the plant spilled into 
ditches and eventually seeped into creeks, a state-owned wildlife 
area and private wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant workers contended in court documents that radioactive  
waste also was deliberately dumped into nearby fields, abandoned 
buildings and a landfill not licensed for hazardous waste, 
according to the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmie Hodges, the Energy Department's site manager at Paducah,  
said in a statement that an inspection of the site found that 
``there are no imminent threats to the public health, worker safety 
or the environment,'' but that the review is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said the Energy Department contends that worker  
exposure was minimal and that contamination is being cleaned up. 
But it notes that a lawsuit filed under seal in June by three 
current plant employees alleges that radiation exposure was a 
problem at the Paducah facility well into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said its investigation found that contractors hid facts  
about plutonium contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the June suit was filed under a law that allows  
employees to collect payment for exposing fraud against the 
government and has been kept under seal to give the Justice 
Department time to decide whether join the suit or to begin a 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said none of the private companies named in the suit  
has been served with it and would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post noted that Paducah is just the latest DOE facility to  
be hit by lawsuits and revelations of contamination. It said 
cleaning up the Kentucky plant is expected to cost $240 billion and 
take at least 75 years.

<HEADLINE> Manson Family Killings Won't Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The night of Aug. 9, 1969, was oppressively  
hot. Windows were left open, but the screams and gunshots were no 
more than distant echoes in the hills around the sheltered Benedict 
Canyon estate. 
</P>
<P>
	No one but the killers heard Sharon Tate pleading for her unborn  
baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, a maid ran screaming into the street after  
finding the actress and four others slaughtered in a grotesque 
scene marked by bloody scrawlings with messages like ``Death to 
Pigs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next night, it happened again. Rosemary and Leno LaBianca, a  
wealthy couple who lived across town, were stabbed to death in 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years later, the ghosts of the Tate-La Bianca murders  
will not rest. The Charles Manson cult that carried out the seven 
killings haunts the Internet and a new generation is oddly fixated 
on a mass murder that remains the nation's most bizarre and 
notorious. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who were even peripherally involved in the case, the  
horror never ends, a spectacle relived in occasional parole 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it as if it was yesterday,'' said realtor Elaine  
Young, who had leased the Benedict Canyon estate to Tate and her 
director husband, Roman Polanski. ``I cried for six weeks 
afterwards and it took me years to recover from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor who wrote the book ``Helter  
Skelter,'' calls the killings ``probably the most bizarre mass 
murder case we've ever had in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bodies were scattered about the lush green estate. Miss Tate,  
who was 8 1/2 months pregnant, was stabbed to death, then hung from a 
rafter in the living room. Also slain were Abigail Folger, heiress 
to the Folger coffee fortune; Voityck Frykowski, a Polish filmmaker 
friend of Polanski's; Jay Sebring, hairdresser to the stars; and 
Steven Parent, a young man shot while leaving the cottage of his 
friend, the caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' fame and status combined with the grisly nature of  
the crimes to draw international attention, which intensified when 
police found the LaBiancas, slain in the upper middle class 
neighborhood of Los Feliz amid the same bloody scrawlings. 
</P>
<P>
	The killers were at large and Southern Californians were thrown  
into panic. People rushed to buy guns and the market for guard dogs 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Los Angeles and I can't remember a time when  
people were more scared,'' said Stephen Kay, the trial 
co-prosecutor who has attended 53 parole hearings for the killers, 
lobbying for their continued incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, police arrested a rag-tag band of cult  
members devoted to a charismatic ex-convict named Charles Manson. 
They called themselves the Manson Family, and the name still 
symbolizes the dark underside of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cult members indulged in drugs, and popular culture may have  
inspired their acts. Bugliosi contends that Manson believed the 
Beatles were talking to him through songs like ``Helter Skelter,'' 
which inspired his desire to foment a race war in America. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial as bizarre as any seen in American courts transfixed the  
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like that old radio show, ``Can You Top This?' It was  
so crazy and so interesting,'' recalled Paul Fitzgerald, the lead 
defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	In her memoir, ``Headline Justice,'' reporter Theo Wilson  
recalled a 10-month trial with ``testimony that went from 
horrifying to ludicrous ... witnesses with names like 'Lotsapoppa, 
Snake and Ouish' ... threats of self immolation and other 
destruction ... a defense attorney disappearing, his drowned body 
undiscovered until many months later on the very day that the 
defendants received death sentences from the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson's three women co-defendants, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van  
Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, were convicted with him after 
taking the stand and attempting to absolve him by admitting their 
own deadly deeds. Another defendant, Charles ``Tex'' Watson, was 
found guilty in a separate trial. Their death sentences were 
commuted to life when the death penalty was briefly outlawed in 
America in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Manson, now in California's Corcoran State Prison,  
who kidnapped the nation's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad but Manson has become somewhat of a folk hero to  
young people. He gets four fan letters a day, more mail than any 
prisoner in the United States,'' Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Internet search of the words ``Charles Manson'' comes up a  
long list of references, including sites devoted to Manson's 
recorded sayings, his music and reproductions of his scrawled notes 
and artwork. 
</P>
<P>
	One Web site, operated by Manson follower Sandra Good, offers  
arguments for Manson to receive a new trial and lengthy excerpts 
from Manson's ``thoughts'' as well as a ``discography'' of 
recordings of his amateur guitar-playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name Manson has become a metaphor for evil,'' said  
Bugliosi, ``and evil has its allure. Some people have the same 
fascination for Jack the Ripper and Hitler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The phenomenon is perhaps best summed up by a former reporter.  
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Gil Garcetti, 
covered the trial for City News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie was always a con man,'' said Gibbons, ``and now he's  
managed to con a whole new generation of people.''

	PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- College students racing robot  
submarines may sound like fun and friendly competition, but the 
technology at work also could help the Navy prevent casualties in 
future wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials are looking at the machines as a way to keep  
sailors and Marines out of harm's way by performing such dangerous 
missions such as finding and neutralizing sea mines and underwater 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Institute of Technology defeated four other  
teams Sunday to repeat as champions of the second annual 
International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to competing for $10,000 in prize money, the  
students got a chance to demonstrate design ideas that may be 
incorporated into operational robot subs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done a lot of academic studying but we've never actually  
designed and built something from the ground up before,'' said 
Ensign Jason Edelberg, part of the team from the U.S. Naval 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	The AUVs, as the robots are known, also are expected to  
significantly increase the speed of underwater mapping and aid in 
searches for shipwrecks or sunken aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Entries were judged on design characteristics, safety and  
craftsmanship before racing in an underwater course consisting of 
six 10-foot-wide gates submerged in 6 to 10 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing the last gate, the robot subs followed a track of  
pipes leading to a target where they dropped depth markers. Points 
were awarded according to the number of gates crossed, whether they 
hit the target and the time needed to complete the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The MIT sub was followed by the University of Florida, Florida  
Atlantic University, the U.S. Naval Academy and Stevens Institute 
of Technology of Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams faced off at the Naval Coastal Systems Center near  
this Florida Panhandle city. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's SubjuGator looked more like a blue box than a  
submarine, but its stubby shape gave it a shorter turning radius, 
said graduate student David Novick. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the subs weighed in around 200 pounds except for Florida  
Atlantic's tiny SQUID, short for Submersible Quiet Underwater 
Intelligent Driver, at just over 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are points for the elegance of the engineering in the  
contest, so we thought that would be a point-getter,'' said Florida 
Atlantic team adviser Ken Holappa, an assistant professor of ocean 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there also are practical considerations including lower  
cost and ease of handling. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't need cranes and everything,'' Holappa said. ``One  
person can pick it up and carry it around.''

<HEADLINE>  Patriots' Johnson May Miss 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITHFIELD, R.I. (AP) -- Tests have confirmed that New England  
Patriots' middle linebacker Ted Johnson suffered a ruptured left 
biceps tendon in Saturday's intrasquad scrimmage at Foxboro 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots' coach Pete Carroll said Johnson underwent a magnetic  
resonance imaging examination in Wellesley, Mass., on Sunday 
morning, and the test confirmed damage to the tendon connected to 
the biceps muscle near his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very similar to what he did last year, and it will  
require surgery,'' Carroll said, referring to Johnson's right 
biceps injury at Pittsburgh last Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said that he expects Johnson to be out of action for at  
least four months. He said he would wait until after surgery to 
determine if Johnson would be placed on injured reserve, which 
would shelve the linebacker for the entire 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year linebacker from Colorado was hurt Saturday as he  
tried to reach for rookie running back Kevin Faulk during the 
second quarter of the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances were similar to the injury Johnson incurred as  
he was trying to bring down the Steelers' Jerome Bettis, 
hyperextending his right arm in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lose a guy of great impact to our club,'' Carroll said.  
``It's a tragedy for Ted because he put so much into it, and has 
been such a diligent worker for so long. It's a crusher to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' options at middle linebacker are limited. Marty  
Moore, the last selection in the 1994 NFL Draft and a special-teams 
standout, was Johnson's backup, with second-year veteran Ron 
Merkerson in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Carroll intends to groom this year's first-round draft  
pick, Andy Katzenmoyer of Ohio State, to take over the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, the 28th pick in the first round, had been battling  
veteran Ted Bruschi for a starting outside linebacker's job. 
Bruschi will now be a starter there and make the defensive calls, 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way we'll turn our sights until we know more, and  
fortunately, we have a guy of that stature to take over that 
spot,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, an inside linebacker at Ohio State, said he was  
prepared to do whatever was needed to help the Patriots' defense 
replace a player who was the team's leading tackler in two of his 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing Ted hurts us tremendously,'' Katzenmoyer said after  
Saturday's scrimmage. ``Someone has to step up and take over for 
him while he's gone. His being hurt is going to slow down the 
defense and put a hitch in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said Katzenmoyer's ``crash course'' would begin  
immediately. The Patriots open the preseason Friday night at 
Foxboro, Mass., against the Washington Redskins.

<HEADLINE> Ruling on Oil Dispute Expected Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an unusual -- some say absurd -- trade  
dispute, a group of small oil companies contends four leading 
foreign oil suppliers are driving them out of business by selling 
the valuable commodity at artificially low prices in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S. government agrees, it could impose a tax raising the  
barrel price of some imported oil by up to 170 percent. The four 
countries -- Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq and Venezuela -- supply about 
60 percent of U.S. oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department was to decide Monday whether to let the  
Oklahoma oilmen's petition go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Already the case has fractured the oil industry, pitting Big Oil  
against the struggling independent producers, and economists say it 
could put America's trade policy to a new test. 
</P>
<P>
	The oilmen's request for an investigation shocked trade experts  
who say oil prices are highly volatile and dictated by world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's absurd about this case is Americans have been opposed  
to higher oil prices for my entire adult lifetime and here we have 
a case where the effect could well be to raise prices,'' says 
Robert Litan, a Brookings Institution economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``This involves a commodity that no one ever would have thought  
would be subject to an anti-dumping case,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of the most vocal critics of the federal law on  
illegal dumping -- when an imported commodity is being sold at less 
than normal value or below what it costs to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harold Hamm, who helped found a group called ``Save Domestic  
Oil'' to bring the complaint, argues the anti-dumping law is 
supposed to protect U.S. companies in just this kind of case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil is not any different. Dumping did occur and it put 100,000  
people out of jobs,'' Hamm, president of an Enid, Okla.-based 
independent oil company, said in a telephone interview. ``There's 
not anything absurd about it. Our only line of defense is the trade 
laws and I think we've got a very good case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent companies also believe the four countries  
unfairly are subsidizing oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations, if found true, would amount to illegal dumping  
of oil in the United States and require Washington to impose 
tariffs and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	A Commerce Department division, the International Trade  
Association, was expected to decide Monday whether the oilmen have 
the right to continue with their case. If they are denied, the 
independent producers can appeal to a special court, though the 
process could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists and trade specialists say the case is weak, and  
some contend that if the oilmen are successful, it could result in 
a backlash against the anti-dumping law enacted almost 70 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of other users of the anti-dumping (provision)  
who do not want this case to go further. It puts a real spotlight 
on it,'' said Gary Hutbauer, a trade expert at the Institute for 
International Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Already the case has had repercussions:  
</P>
<P>
	--The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the large,  
international oil companies, has pledged to fight it along every 
step, hiring a lawyer who specializes in bringing anti-dumping 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than 100 organizations, companies and industry groups from  
airlines and truckers to farmers are opposed, arguing a favorable 
ruling would harm consumers by raising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mexico has delayed plans to phase out its tariff on U.S.  
natural gas imports until the anti-dumping case is resolved. 
Venezuela has denied the charge it is selling oil at below market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Some oil industry experts also are concerned about the fate of  
recent efforts to promote greater U.S. industry involvement in 
Saudi oil development. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the long term, its difficult to see who would benefit from  
this action,'' says Red Cavaney, president of the American 
Petroleum Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists say the nature of world oil markets argues  
against the petition. If Saudi Arabia faces a high tariff in the 
United States, it will sell its oil elsewhere and oil from another 
country may come to the United States, these experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, some U.S. refineries are geared to handling certain  
products coming from Mexico and Venezuela and a shift in sources 
could require additional costs, raising prices, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	While the oilmen's petition is viewed as a long shot, trade  
experts say the anti-dumping provision is heavily stacked in favor 
of domestic companies and a favorable ruling is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton administration would prefer this case go away. The  
question is whether legally they can let it go away,'' says Litan, 
the Brookings economist.

<HEADLINE> Aging Titans Owner Wants Super Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams is in a  
league of his own. And he wants out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams' franchise is the only one of the original eight AFL teams  
that has never made it to a Super Bowl. The 76-year-old Texas 
oilman who has owned the team since its inception in 1959 knows 
that all too well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every owner wants to get into the Super Bowl, and my desire's  
still strong. I'm getting old. I've got to get in there pretty 
soon,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His team, known as the Oilers until February, has been close  
twice, losing the 1978 and 1979 AFC championship games to eventual 
champion Pittsburgh. They have never gotten past the divisional 
playoffs since. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after three straight 8-8 seasons, Adams has made it clear  
he expects improvement. The team has a new stadium and new 
state-of-the-art practice facility, and all its key players back. 
That should add up to a playoff berth, Adams believes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking for this team with the new stadium and the new  
practice facility to really come out and show something this 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Adams was among the NFL's most hands-on owners. Some  
saw him as a meddler. Last month, saying he had to spend more time 
on his oil business, Adams relinquished the title of team president 
to Jeff Diamond, the 1998 NFL Executive of the Year when he was a 
vice president with the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still would like to be working with the Titans full-time,  
but it's not in the books,'' Adams said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams played college football at Menlo and Kansas, where he got  
an engineering degree, then moved to Houston in 1946 and made his 
fortune drilling for oil. Later, he expanded into farming, 
ranching, car dealerships and real estate and Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	He sponsored amateur teams in softball and basketball, and got  
into professional football in 1959 when he helped Lamar Hunt found 
the American Football League. The Oilers, behind Billy Cannon and 
George Blanda, won the AFL's first two championships and Adams was 
the toast of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is reviled in his hometown for uprooting the Oilers and  
moving them to Tennessee in 1997. In Nashville, critics consider 
him a carpetbagger who played on the city's strong desire for an 
NFL team to get taxpayers to cough up $292 million for a new 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams knows he still has work to do in Nashville, where fans  
were disappointed when he had his team play its first season in 
Memphis and upset by the high ticket prices charged when the team 
played its second season at Vanderbilt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``In time the fans ... will understand that NFL football is  
exciting and that this new stadium will be the place to be. It'll 
really be a fun affair. But we've just got to go through it and let 
them see that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he never wanted to leave Houston but had no choice  
because the city refused to build a new stadium that would help 
keep the team competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really the Astrodome was a baseball stadium not really built  
with football lines in mind,'' Adams said. ``It just wasn't a good 
stadium to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case with 67,700-seat Adelphia Coliseum on the  
banks of the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium features 144 luxury suites and club seating, with  
revenue from those going to Adams. The city's contract with Adams 
also gives him parking, concessions and naming rights that will 
bring the team $30 million over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Astrodome, Adams had to pay rent and watch most of the  
stadium's revenue go to the Astros' ownership. As the dome aged, 
the Oilers began losing and attendance started dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Adams wishes he could have stayed in Houston, where the  
Astros now are waiting for a new stadium to be completed. City 
officials also are talking of a new arena for the Rockets and 
businessman Bob McNair hopes to land an NFL expansion franchise 
with plans for a new football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're talking about spending a billion dollars on three  
stadiums,'' said Adams, who had wanted a facility similar to San 
Antonio's Alamodome that he could share with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	If McNair does land a franchise, he won't be able to revive the  
Oilers name. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed last year to 
retire that nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	By changing his team's nickname to the Titans and getting a new  
logo and uniform design, Adams finally has Tennessee fans warming 
up to his teams after two years of lackluster commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of personal seat licenses for the new stadium gives the  
team a season ticket base of more than 49,000, which ensures its 
best home attendance since 1993. And team merchandise is selling 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Adams knows his team must win to keep its new fans happy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think having a winning season is going to satisfy the  
fans. They're going to want to get in the playoffs and hopefully go 
to the Super Bowl,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Many Questioned in Olympics Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Federal investigators have questioned a  
number of people in their investigation of Salt Lake City's Olympic 
bribery scandal, from private consultants to higher-ups in the 
city's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Even former Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank  
Joklik has been interviewed since the U.S. Department of Justice 
probe into an alleged $1 million vote buying scheme began, the 
Deseret News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik voluntarily submitted to an interview in February, said  
his lawyer, Mark Tuohey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank's been cooperating with anyone who wants to talk to  
him,'' Tuohey said. But he also said the interview was ``pretty 
generic background about the organization and how it functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, Joklik's predecessor at SLOC and the head of the Salt  
Lake bid committee until he was ousted amid allegations of 
wife-beating, has not been questioned, according to his attorney, 
Tom Schaffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's name came up last week, when Utah businessman David E.  
Simmons pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons admitted in court that he hired the son of International  
Olympic Committee member Kim Un-yong at the request of the bid 
committee, then claimed as a business expense the money funneled to 
him to pay his salary. Simmons said Welch asked him to hire John 
Kim for the sham job. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is just ``the first charge in the investigation,'' said  
Myron Marlin, the spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	While Welch hasn't talked, plenty of others have been called in  
by the FBI and other agencies, including two members of the City 
Council, Joanne Milner and Deeda Seed, who are outspoken critics of 
SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City attorney Roger Cutler said he met with  
investigators at least six months ago. Much of the discussion, he 
said, centered around the city's hiring the son of a former IOC 
member from Swaziland, David Sibandze. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze resigned his membership after it was revealed his son,  
Sibusiso Sibandze, worked as an intern in City Hall in 1993 and 
1994. Cutler told investigators Sibandze was paid by the city and 
did legitimate work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed satisfied after that,'' Cutler said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Roger Black, director of management services for the city,  
said three federal agents interviewed him a few months ago, mostly 
about Sibandze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the person on the city staff who was ultimately  
responsible in Sibusiso's employment,'' Black said. ``I guess 
that's what they were interested in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has roamed far afield, with a Canadian  
consultant and New Jersey travel business owner also being 
contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahmoud El Farnawani, who has a heart condition that keeps him  
from traveling, was interviewed by federal agents at his Toronto 
home a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC Board of Ethics report found El Farnawani earned nearly  
$150,000 working for the committee, lobbying North African and 
other IOC members. His targets included Bashir Attarbulsi of Libya, 
who resigned after it was revealed his son attended Brigham Young 
University at bid committee expense. 
</P>
<P>
	El Farnawani said he had nothing to do with that arrangement,  
but would not say what he discussed with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a grilling,'' said El Farnawani's attorney, David M.  
Goodman. ``They just wanted to hear his whole story, what his 
involvement was with (the bid committee) when he worked for them.''

<HEADLINE> Goh: Singapore Economy To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said  
Sunday that the country's economy should grow by a stunning 4 to 5 
percent this year, up from the government's earlier prediction that 
the economy will show growth of up to 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Singapore economy is recovering from the regional  
financial crisis,'' Goh said a national address. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the economy grew by a ``very strong'' 6.7 percent in the  
second quarter of this year, bringing growth for the first half of 
1999 to 3.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Singapore economy should continue to recover in the second  
half of the year,'' Goh said, adding that the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry has revised its GDP growth forecast for 1999 to between 4 
and 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GDP is the measure of all goods and services produced within a  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a pretty sensible, conservative prediction, taking into  
account the performance in the second quarter,'' said Friedrich Wu, 
vice-president of economic research at Development Bank of 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without uncertainties in Asia, the Singapore economy could  
recover to a higher degree,'' Wu told The Associated Press Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This rich city-state of 3.2 million was hit by the regional  
economic crisis in late 1997 and grew by only 0.3 percent in 1998. 
But the economy showed signs of recovery by expanding by 0.8

</P>
<P>
	Goh warned that the recovery is far from complete.  
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate, currently at 3.9 percent, is still higher  
than before the crisis, and financial services still have not 
completely recovered. He also cited ``external uncertainties'' that 
may stall Singapore's recovery, such as Japan's continuing economic 
crisis and developments in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Underwood Disappearance Stuns Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood, the Minnesota Vikings  
defensive lineman who left training camp after one practice and has 
not returned, acted differently in the weeks before camp, people 
close to him said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's high school football coach said the first-round  
draft pick seemed anxious and less excited about becoming a Viking, 
according to a Star Tribune report. Underwood's mother also thought 
he was acting differently but didn't know why, the coach told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also reported Sunday that religion might have  
played a role in Underwood's changing behavior and his decision to 
leave the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old rookie repeatedly called his family's minister  
in North Carolina to talk about a deep religious experience he had 
had, the newspaper said. While attending Michigan State University 
in Lansing, he joined a nondenominational church. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood left training camp last Monday, and his whereabouts  
remained unknown Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Viking's officials said they will cut their ties with  
the rookie, according to a report in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings' attorneys informed Underwood's agent, Craig Domann,  
that the team doesn't want him back, the newspaper reported Sunday. 
The newspaper said the Vikings haven't decided how to part ways 
with the rookie, but most likely they will place him on waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood signed a $5.3 million, six-year contract shortly  
before joining the Vikings at Minnesota State, Mankato for training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	About a month ago, he began calling the Rev. Moses Townsend, his  
family's pastor, at the Fountain of Life Deliverance Church in 
Fayetteville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like he had become religious. He didn't want to talk  
about football,'' Townsend said. ``He was just excited about his 
Christian experience and religious experience. He said the Lord was 
revealing some things to him out of the scripture, out of the word 
of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood called him twice a week for about three weeks and  
wanted Townsend to fly to Michigan to talk to him about his 
experiences. Townsend flew to Michigan last Sunday and arrived a 
few hours after Underwood came to the Twin Cities for the start of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood had become a parishioner at Immanuel's Temple  
Community church, said its pastor, Phillip E. Owens, who also goes 
by prophet. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked Saturday whether he had spoken to Underwood and  
whether Underwood was all right, Owens said: ``I don't know if we 
can be at liberty (to say). I'd like to withhold anything at this 
time. The situation is a very delicate one now.'' Initially, Owens 
said Underwood ``was under our care,'' but then said that didn't 
mean anything more than that he was a parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry McDonald, who had been the head football coach at E.E.  
Smith High School in Fayetteville, sensed that something was amiss 
with his former star player. Around the July 4th weekend, they 
talked by phone and Underwood said he had just fired one agent and 
was looking for another. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounded a little more apprehensive, not so much about the  
league but just in general,'' McDonald said. ``His demeanor, 
everything about the league, the tone in his voice did not have the 
fire in it he had before. I asked him, `Is everything going OK?' 
and he got quiet and didn't say anything at that point. ... He was 
supposed to call me back, but he didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, said Saturday at her home  
in Philadelphia that she was uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel I need to examine what happened to some of his  
thinking between the day he got drafted and the day he left that 
camp,'' she said. ``I have some hunches I need to examine in that 
area, what happened in Michigan to influence such a change in his 
life.'' She offered no details, but said, ``I don't know if he's 
dead or alive right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Underwood said she is concerned that someone in the  
church her son attended in Lansing had tried to exert ``undue 
influence on him'' but she wouldn't elaborate or identify the 
person.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Has 3 RBIs in Minors Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry continued his comeback  
from a drug suspension Saturday with two hits and three RBIs in a 
Triple-A doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry went 2-for-3 in the opener and 0-for-1 in the  
nightcap, sitting out most of the game after a 30-minute rain delay 
in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opener, Strawberry doubled in the second inning and  
singled in the fifth to drive in two runs in the Columbus Clippers' 
7-4 victory over Charlotte in the International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who batted fourth and played left field in the first  
game, also struck out looking in the third. He is batting .375 
(6-for-16) in five games with Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	His only at-bat in the second game was a groundout that drove in  
a run. Charlotte beat Columbus 4-1.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defender Declines Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cheryl Mills, a staunch defender of President  
Clinton who played a key role at his impeachment trial, turned down 
his history-making offer to make her the next White House counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills would have been the first woman and first black to serve  
as the president's chief lawyer. But she informed Clinton of her 
decision Friday after considering his offer for much of the summer, 
officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills has worked for Clinton since the start of his presidency,  
and became a central player on the legal team that defended him and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton during the many investigations of the last 
few years -- from Whitewater and fund-raising to the Monica Lewinsky 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cheryl is a wonderful lawyer and a wonderful person, but I  
think she decided that it was time for her after 6 1/2 years to move 
on. She is tired and wants to get her life centered,'' White House 
chief of staff John Podesta said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta said Mills, 34, had some offers in the private sector,  
and ``I'm confident she is going to continue to serve her community 
and to serve the public. That is what really motivates her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills has agreed to remain at the White House as acting counsel  
until a successor to Charles F.C. Ruff is named. Ruff, who served 
as presidential counsel during the most turbulent years of 
Clinton's tenure, is returning to private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	A confidante of both the president and Mrs. Clinton, Mills  
worked her way up in the counsel's office from a junior lawyer 
working on the original Whitewater hearings in Congress in 1994 to 
the top deputy's spot. 
</P>
<P>
	She earned a reputation as an unapologetic and loyal Clinton  
defender, espousing a strategy of not giving an inch to 
presidential critics. It's a role that endeared her to the first 
family but landed her as a witness before grand juries and 
congressional committees investigating the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans got their most extensive view of her during Clinton's  
impeachment trial Jan. 20. From the well of the Senate and before 
live television, she gave a spirited defense of the president's 
record and contested Republican allegations he had violated the 
civil rights of accuser Paula Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills argued that Clinton's private behavior with Ms. Lewinsky  
was ``not attractive or admirable,'' but his ``record on civil 
rights, on women's rights, on all our rights, is unimpeachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling attention to her race and gender, she added, ``I stand  
here before you today because President Bill Clinton believed I 
could stand here for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She finished her presentation to a hushed Senate, and afterwards  
Republicans and Democrats alike praised her. The next day's 
Washington Post headline blared, ``In the city of legal stars, 
another is born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills' tenure, however, was not without controversy. Republicans  
on a House subcommittee accused her last year of withholding two 
documents from investigators on an unrelated matter. She denied 
withholding the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the eve of her questioning by Senate Whitewater Committee  
staff a few years earlier, Mills' car was broken into and copies of 
notes stolen.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Miller Glad To Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Denver quarterback Chris Miller took  
the wrong option and then he was in orbit, sent flying by giant San 
Diego defensive end Dwight Keith. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a crucial moment for Miller, remarkably playing his first  
game since his football career was sent into a tailspin with a 
series of concussions in the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be taking those type of hits but it was pretty  
nice to take the hit and get back up and have my senses about me,'' 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos third-stringer, on the field after stints by starter  
Bubby Brister and youngster Brian Griese, dusted himself off and 
led the team out from deep in its territory. He got Denver into 
field goal range and, on the final play of the game, Jason Elam 
kicked the 35-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 20-17 win in 
Sunday's American Bowl exhibition at Sydney's Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	There were doctors who told Miller he should never return after  
he suffered multiple serious concussions in 14 months while with 
the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	For a team bidding for an unprecedented third straight Super  
Bowl championship and faced with the loss of retired John Elway, 
Miller's comeback is intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	He played 95 NFL games in seven seasons with Atlanta Falcons and  
two with the Rams. Then Miller's world caved in. He thought he 
might never play the game again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a couple of people who raised their eyebrows when they  
heard I was going to go back but I figured I had to because of the 
opportunity to play for the two-time defending world champs, and I 
wanted my kids to see me play football,'' said Miller, who 
celebrates his 34th birthday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to see the doctors and took the most extensive,  
thorough examination you can for your head and it was deemed I was 
healthy. But sure, maybe I'm a little more high risk than the 
average guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller completed 11 of 13 passes for 136 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he enjoyed playing with his kids, Dillon and Jessie, the  
past three years but missed the challenge of football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was being bored, man. I was playing basketball, playing golf  
and I still felt real athletic and I couldn't really find anything 
to fill that athletic desire,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't boring at all today, it was a lot of fun. I didn't  
do it very picturesue. I made a bad mistake by stepping out of the 
pocket when I probably could have stepped up and took the sack ... 
but I had a great time today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is now biding his time behind Brister and Griese -- but  
waiting is something he should be great at by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got two talented players in front of me,'' Miller said.  
``Bubby Brister and Brian Griese are very good quarterbacks, and my 
main goal is just to compete. Bubby'll do a great job, I hope he 
stays healthy and takes us back to the Super Bowl. But if not 
Brian'll be ready and I'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's game-winning drive showed the contrast between the  
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Harbaugh made a great start to his career at San Diego,  
taking the Chargers on a 13-play touchdown drive. No. 2 Erik Kramer 
also pleased coach Mike Riley, but Miller easily won the battle of 
the third strings over Craig Whelihan.

<HEADLINE> Govt Unit To Control Flow of US News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, dismayed by the  
success of anti-American propaganda worldwide, is striking back 
with an information offensive of its own: a State Department unit 
that will control the flow of government news overseas, especially 
during crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The new International Public Information group, or IPI, will  
coordinate the dissemination of news from the State Department, 
Pentagon and other U.S. agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is intended to do is organize the instruments of the  
federal government to be able to support the public diplomacy, 
military engagements and economic initiatives that we have 
overseas,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the White House's 
National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	In the recent Kosovo war, the Pentagon, State Department and  
White House poured out information each day but no single agency 
tried to assemble it so that the United States spoke with a 
coordinated message overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The group came about partly in response to the spread of  
unflattering or erroneous information about the United States 
received abroad via electronic mail, the Internet, cellular 
telephones and other communications advances. 
</P>
<P>
	In many respects, the new information group is a smaller, less  
structured successor to the independent U.S. Information Agency, 
which the State Department will absorb in October. 
</P>
<P>
	A new office of undersecretary of state for public diplomacy  
will run the IPI. The current USIA director, Evelyn Lieberman, has 
been nominated for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton signed a directive April 30, in the thick of  
the Kosovo war, that set out plans for IPI, although the White 
House did not formally announce the group's existence or role. 
</P>
<P>
	An unclassified mission statement obtained by The Associated  
Press described IPI's role: 
</P>
<P>
	``Effective use of our nation's highly developed communications  
and information capabilities to address misinformation and 
incitement, mitigate inter-ethnic conflict, promote independent 
media organizations and the free flow of information, and support 
democratic participation will advance our interests and is a 
critical foreign policy objective,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Mower, director of Latin American and African programs for  
the Freedom Forum, said she worries the coordinated effort may 
filter information that should be broadly available to foreign 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is that the more information is out there, the  
better,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPI will hold its first formal meeting this fall, said a  
government official involved in the process. Clinton's directive 
orders officials at the Pentagon, FBI, CIA and the departments of 
State, Commerce and Treasury to organize the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Regular members will be senior diplomats and others in foreign  
policy or national security jobs in Washington, according to the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The rationale for IPI dates at least to the confusion and bad  
press surrounding U.S. intervention in Haiti in 1994-1995, but 
Kosovo is the best recent example of how the United States needs to 
fight a propaganda war in concert with military strikes, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``President (Slobodan) Milosevic has an extensive propaganda  
machine,'' Leavy said. ``We've worked very hard to try to 
counteract that propaganda machine, and make sure the people in 
Serbia and in Kosovo have access to their own news -- that they can 
make their own independent judgments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-American sentiment ran high during the 78-day air war, even  
among Yugoslavs who did not support the Yugoslav president. Many 
Europeans also were leery of the airstrikes, seen as a U.S. 
enterprise, and reluctant to level hefty military power against a 
modern European capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The air war that ended in June also produced one of the worst  
diplomatic and public relations disasters in recent memory when a 
U.S. plane mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 
7, killing three Chinese journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged mobs rushed the American Embassy in Beijing, trapping  
then-Ambassador James Sasser inside for a time. It was days before 
the United States could get its official apology before the Chinese 
people at large, and the U.S. explanation was greeted with disdain 
by both the Chinese government and the rock-throwing street mobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily,  
called the war and the embassy bombing ``a great step in the United 
States' strategy to dominate the world.''

<HEADLINE> Menifee Wins Haskell at Monmouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Trainer Elliott Walden made all the right  
decisions and Menifee did the rest, roaring down the stretch to win 
the $1 million Haskell Invitation Sunday by a half-length at 
Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden, who is on a roll with victories in the Whitney, Haskell  
and Jim Dandy in the last week, scratched Ecton Park from the 
Haskell Friday and in favor of the Jim Dandy at Saratoga Sunday, 
which he won easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Menifee who went off as the 3-2 favorite, stalked  
Forestry and Cat Thief from the halfway mark. Then Menifee, ridden 
by Pat Day, rushed past his two rivals to win in 1:48.6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great performance,'' said Day. ``This was reminiscent  
of his races in the Derby and the Preakness (both seconds) after 
that disappointment in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been coming around and was even better today,'' added  
Day, who had a choice of riding either Menifee or second place 
finisher Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Cat Thief and Menifee have faced each other five  
times now and Menifee has won them all. The win was Menifee's third 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously likes this track,'' said Walden referring to the  
sire where Menifee broke his maiden in his first race last summer. 
``It was a good omen coming back to the me track for the first 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee's win was worth $600,000 and increased his lifetime  
earnings to $1,485,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee paid $5.00, 2.80 and 2.10. Cat Thief paid 3.20 and 2.20  
and Forestry was 2.10 to show.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Case Summaries Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next important step in the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. happens early this week when 
the judge receives hundreds of pages of documents largely 
summarizing months of courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the sides to  
present by Tuesday their versions of the facts of the case, one of 
the final steps toward a possible verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who planned an unorthodox appearance in Atlanta on  
Monday at a panel discussion with lawyers for Microsoft and the 
government, could decide the case late this year or early in 2000 -- 
unless off-and-on settlement negotiations succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began last October, the sides have met several  
times outside the courtroom, including once in early June. Future 
talks are anticipated this summer, but outside legal experts 
consider settlement unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust case, which accuses Microsoft of illegally  
wielding monopoly power in the software industry to crush potential 
rivals, has been on hiatus for seven weeks, since courtroom 
testimony ended June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said its court filing this week will focus on what it  
considers the government's failure to prove that the company's 
actions hurt customers, which would be necessary to support a 
guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The company apparently hopes to capitalize on a potentially  
embarrassing slip by government witness Franklin Fisher, an 
economist. Fisher told Justice lawyer David Boies in January that 
Microsoft's behavior ``on balance'' hasn't harmed consumers ``up to 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher caught himself moments later and amended his answer to  
explain that he believed consumers eventually would feel an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft strongly disagrees, said a company lawyer who outlined  
arguments in Microsoft's court filing on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, Microsoft will reassert that it's not an entrenched  
monopolist in the fast-paced technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It will argue it didn't illegally discourage the nation's  
largest computer makers and Internet providers from distributing 
Web-browsing software manufactured by rival Netscape Communications 
Corp., recently bought by America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The government improperly focused on a few manufacturers of  
computer operating-system software to illustrate Microsoft's 
dominance, the company contends. Proving a company wields monopoly 
power is essential to winning an antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft said it will argue it doesn't charge prices as  
high as a monopolist would, and its massive spneding on research 
and development of new software ``makes no sense if Microsoft had 
durable monopoly power,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants the judge to consider an array of fledgling  
technologies as its competition -- including new types of software 
and devices developed by America Online and others. It hopes to 
show that even though its flagship Windows software runs most of 
the world's personal computers, Microsoft's future influence is far 
from certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In another of its arguments, Microsoft will challenge the  
government's allegation that it included browsing software free in 
Windows in 1995 to undermine Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers, citing e-mails, contend Microsoft spent  
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop its Internet software 
but gave it away only after Netscape emerged as a threat to Windows 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's lawsuit quotes Microsoft's senior vice  
president, Paul Maritz, saying: ``We are going to cut off 
(Netscape's) air supply. Everything they're selling, we're going to 
give away for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz denied making the comment, and on Sunday, The New Yorker  
reported, in its edition on newsstands Monday, Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates' reaction to the alleged quotation: 
</P>
<P>
	``A great lie! An unbelievable lie. Did anyone utter those  
words? Our e-mail, every piece of it, has been searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had found somebody who said it. Then we could take  
him out, and we could hang the guy, then we'd say OK, mea culpa. We 
found him -- the guy who said, `I'll cut off your oxygen.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge will give the two sides one month to review each  
other's documents, then make revisions to their own filings and 
return them Sept. 10. Courtroom arguments are set for Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> Gas Price Increase Slows Somewhat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The steady increase in gasoline prices  
slowed to about 2 cents over the past two weeks and may drop 
further because of flattening crude oil prices, an industry analyst 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average on Friday, including all grades  
and taxes, was $1.2849, up 1.78 cents from the previous survey 
conducted July 23, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices had jumped 5 cents during the previous survey,  
so this increase marks a slowing, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediate increases in crude oil prices are not likely,'' she  
said. ``So gasoline price increases should weaken further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices had reached their highest point in more than 18 months in  
July partly because of production cuts by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as recovering Asian and 
Latin American economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Since crude oil prices are not rising as much as they were  
during last month's high point, hikes in gas prices should slow as 
well, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The caveat is the West Coast is still short of gas due to  
refinery problems,'' she said. In the past two weeks, prices in the 
West jumped about 4 1/2 cents per gallon, while prices dropped in the 
Midwest, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rose nearly 7 cents in Reno, Nev., but fell about 3 cents  
in Indianapolis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-serve pumps, the average for regular unleaded was  
$1.2308, mid-grade was $1.3297 and premium was $1.4153. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, regular was $1.5596, mid-grade averaged  
$1.6497 and premium $1.7212.

<HEADLINE> 'Little Lady' Comment Spurred Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia Supreme Court Justice Carol W. Hunstein  
overcame polio and the amputation of a leg from cancer before she 
even thought of going to law school. After she became a lawyer, 
things still weren't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a particular judge in DeKalb County who used to  
refer to me as 'little lady,''' says Hunstein, who was honored with 
four other women Sunday by the American Bar Association's 
Commission on Women in the Profession. ``He wasn't fair to me and 
the result was he wasn't fair to my clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the reason that I actually ran for the judgeship'' in  
DeKalb County in 1984, Hunstein said in an interview. ``I said, 'At 
least I know I can be fair and impartial.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years later, then-Gov. Zell Miller named her to the state  
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The five women received the Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of  
Achievement Award, named after America's first female lawyer, who 
practiced during the 1630s and unsuccessfully demanded the right to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years ago, we were not treated very professionally by anyone  
involved in the judicial system or the legal system,'' Hunstein 
told a packed ballroom audience. ``It is because of what we have 
overcome that women have worked toward achieving equality for all, 
not just for women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunstein had polio when she was 18 months old, bone cancer at  
age 4 and another bout with cancer at age 23 that led to the 
amputation of a leg below the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father did not think girls needed a college education, so  
she married at 17, had a child a year later and was divorced by age 
22. She went to college on a state vocational rehabilitation 
scholarship and to law school on Social Security she received after 
her former husband died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping I've repaid the government for the help it has  
given me,'' Hunstein said in the interview. She heads Georgia's 
equality commission, aimed at ending gender, racial and ethnic bias 
in the state justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I would be where I am if it were not for a lot  
of women who have committed themselves to equality for women,'' 
Hunstein said. ``I hope that I can reach out and help women 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another award recipient, Stanford law professor Barbara Allen  
Babcock, is working on a biography of Clara Shortridge Foltz, a 
19th century feminist and California's first female lawyer. In 1893 
at the Chicago World's Fair, Foltz made the first known proposal in 
the United States to create a government-funded public defender's 
office for poor people charged with crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Foltz was thrown out of law school at one point because the  
rustling of her skirts disturbed the male students, Babcock said, 
drawing a laugh from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock headed the District of Columbia public defender's office  
during the late 1960s and became Stanford's first female law 
professor in 1972. She remained the only woman there for the next 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she told the audience, ``Just as women have gained great  
stature as lawyers, our profession is falling apart. Lay people 
complain of greed and inhumanity, needless aggression and soulless 
lack of concern about societal effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Women lawyers will soon be a numerical force great enough to  
reverse these trends and return the practice of law to the humane, 
public-interested and redemptive work that was once its 
aspiration,'' Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored Sunday were Houston environmental attorney Carol E.  
Dinkins, lawyer Pauline A. Schneider of Washington, D.C., and U.S. 
District Judge Norma L. Shapiro of Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> After Scandal, Coach Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- A confident Mike DuBose opened Alabama's  
season on Sunday, warmly greeting his incoming freshmen and showing 
no signs of stress in the wake of the school settling a sexual 
harassment claim against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-year Alabama coach, who also was celebrating his 24th  
wedding anniversary Sunday, admitted last Thursday to lying to 
school officials and the public about his personal life. The 
admission came only after the school paid $350,000 to another 
employee to settle claims against him. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, arguably the most recognized public official in the  
state, had stayed low-key since the announcement, but finally made 
himself available to answer questions on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made some mistakes, we've admitted those and moved  
forward,'' he said. ``It's my anniversary today, we've been married 
24 years and she's a very strong lady and I'm a strong man. Things 
are good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as he welcomed 24 scholarship freshmen and two invited  
walk-ons to campus, it almost seemed like things at Alabama were 
back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's highly anticipated class, considered DuBose's  
strongest, seemed anxious to talk only about football on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People make mistakes and I don't think his is even relevant to  
football,'' freshman fullback Jeremy Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have prayed for coach DuBose and I know that what he did  
won't affect the team,'' freshman receiver Brandon Greer said. ``It 
just needs to be let go because he knows he did wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said he would discuss the situation in a team meeting  
when the varsity players report on Tuesday because ``they deserve 
to have it addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama assistant head coach Ronnie Cottrell said 10  
``prominent'' seniors stopped by the football offices on Friday to 
show their support for DuBose, and said he had yet to hear a player 
voice any negativity toward the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone said to me this situation will either pull us together  
or tear us apart,'' Cottrell said. ``I think it has already started 
to pull us together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the public -- and even some members of Alabama's  
administration -- that have been divided. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people responded to the Mobile Register's  
call-in poll, and only a slight majority of those, 518-487, felt 
DuBose should remain Alabama's coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Birmingham News dedicated nearly a full page Sunday to  
reader letters concerning the DuBose scandal, and a majority of the 
responses were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``With DuBose at the helm, this is going to be a major  
distraction to the team,'' wrote Frank Beall of Anniston. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama President Andrew Sorenson said he considered firing  
DuBose, but ``the decision was made to try to reach a settlement 
and, by definition, that is engaging in the art of a compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some people feel the damage has already been done, and by a  
coach who has long stressed strong moral ethics and values. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked about those qualities again on Sunday when he said  
this year's recruiting class had ``tremendous character.'' He 
avoided talking about his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever been as excited about coming to work  
as I am right now. I don't think I've even been as excited about 
going home,'' DuBose said. ``We've made mistakes, but we're going 
to move on from this.''

<HEADLINE> Judge, Lawyer Sue Tobacco Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A Mississippi judge and a lawyer are alleging that  
the nation's third largest tobacco company illegally obtained 
private phone records in an effort to intimidate and discredit them 
during a second-hand smoke trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Billy Joe Landrum and plaintiffs attorney Cynthia Langston  
claim in separate lawsuits that lawyers for Brown &AMP; Williamson 
Tobacco Corp. invaded their privacy in 1997 as part of a conspiracy 
to have the judge removed from the case, The Dallas Morning News 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers for the tobacco company spread rumors that  
Landrum and Langston were involved in a romantic relationship, said 
Jeff Reynolds, a lawyer representing the pair. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted so badly to prove that Judge Landrum and Cindy  
were having an affair because that would obviously mean they were 
meeting privately without the defense being present, and that's 
improper,'' Reynolds said. ``The only problem for them was, it 
wasn't true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, filed in October 1998, also allege tobacco company  
lawyers conspired with phone company employee Michael Miller, 
Langston's ex-husband, to access the phone records. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing Brown &AMP; Williamson and its law firm deny  
they obtained the phone records. They describe the allegations as 
baseless and frivolous and asked a judge to dismiss the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell South Communications and Miller, who are also defendants,  
have denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations, if true, could violate Mississippi fraud and  
theft statutes as well as federal laws prohibiting the improper 
taking of privately stored electronic communications and data for 
commercial gain, according to lawyers in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston represented Ava Dean Butler in her lawsuit in which she  
alleged her husband's 1994 death stemmed from second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, tobacco lawyers complained that Landrum  
constantly ruled against them. He became the first judge in the 
country to rule that previously secret internal industry documents 
should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, an anonymous note on the letterhead of an industry  
law firm claimed ``unethical behavior'' on the part of members of 
the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter alleged meetings between Miller and George Hewes, a  
Jackson, Miss., lawyer who was lead counsel for Brown &AMP; Williamson 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewes said in sworn depositions that he met or called Miller  
four times during the case but never asked for nor received any 
phone records. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Miller suggested there was improper contact between  
Langston and Landrum, who have sworn under oath they had no 
romantic relationship nor any improper private meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, frustrated with the rumors, resigned from the Butler  
case, which the tobacco companies later won at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict is being appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bell South fired Miller and conducted an internal investigation.  
The company has yet to disclose its findings.

	Clinton Warns of Tax-Cut Aftermath  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- President Clinton, seeking allies in his battle  
against the Republican tax-cut plan, warned the nation's governors 
today that the $792 billion package would trigger ``huge cuts'' in 
Medicare, farm programs and other spending critical to their 
voters. Opening a new attack on the 10-year, tax-cut bill passed by 
Congress last week, the president said Washington faces ``a 
generational challenge'': how to divide projected surpluses among 
tax cuts, debt reduction and popular federal programs.

	Report: Taliban Had bin Laden Deal  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Saudi officials reached a secret deal with  
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers last summer for the surrender of 
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, two months before the bombing 
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today. Taliban supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar and his 
ruling council agreed to end the sanctuary they provided bin Laden 
since 1996 in a June 1998 meeting at their headquarters in 
Kandahar, Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudi chief of intelligence, 
told the Times. But the agreement began to crumble during the same 
period that authorities now believe the embassy attacks were being 
plotted, the newspaper said.

	Gov't Unit To Control Flow of US News

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, dismayed by the  
success of anti-American propaganda worldwide, is striking back 
with an information offensive of its own: a State Department unit 
that will control the flow of government news overseas, especially 
during crises. The new International Public Information group, or 
IPI, will coordinate the dissemination of news from the State 
Department, Pentagon and other U.S. agencies.

	Study Links Crime Drop, Legal Abortion  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An unpublished study circulating among economists  
and criminal-law experts suggests that the legalization of abortion 
in the early 1970s has contributed to a drop in crime, the Chicago 
Tribune reported today. Several academics and lawyers called the 
research compelling and provocative, but others are skeptical. The 
researchers argue that many women whose children would have been 
most likely to commit crimes as young adults instead chose to abort 
their pregnancies. Because of that, a disproportionate number of 
would-be criminals in the 1990s were not born in the 1970s, the 
professors conclude.

Albright was putting off a visit to the region. Albright had been 
expected to visit in late August to prod forward the peace process, 
but Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the visit was delayed

remain divided over when to implement Israeli troop withdrawals 
from the West Bank promised in the land-for-security deal reached 
in October at Wye River, Md.

<HEADLINE> Russians Found Alive in Bering Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Six Russians whose skiffs were lost for  
four days as they made their way home across the Bering Sea have 
been found and rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	The six boaters in three skiffs were found in good condition.  
They were part of a group of 37 people, mainly Siberian Eskimos, 
who had set out Tuesday in 14 skiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The boaters had become separated from the larger group while  
making the 65-mile Bering Strait crossing from St. Lawrence Island 
off Alaska's west coast to Provideniya on Russia's Chukotka 
Peninsula 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard plane spotted four people in two skiffs on  
Saturday, about 30 miles east of Provideniya, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. 
Brian Flory said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, two others in a third skiff were spotted by  
a Russian freighter. All six were hungry and thirsty, but did not 
appear to be seriously injured, Flory said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were making the six-hour crossing loaded with supplies and  
gifts from relatives and friends in Gambell. Many residents of 
Russia's Chukotka Peninsula share the same Siberian Yupik Eskimo 
ancestry and language with residents of St. Lawrence Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The flotilla ran into rough seas during the crossing. Two people  
-- a father and son -- drowned when their skiff sank. The Coast Guard 
said the boaters had departed without survival gear or flotation 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had launched an intensive airborne search for  
the missing skiffs late Tuesday night. The search was called off 
Friday, but resumed Saturday after the Coast Guard received 
permission from Russian authorities to search on the Russian side 
of the maritime boundary. 
</P>
<P>
	A C-130 transport plane was able to drop a radio, food, gasoline  
and supplies to two of the boats Saturday. The survivors were taken 
aboard a Russian freighter bound for Provideniya and later were 
joined by the other missing boaters.

<HEADLINE> Race To Harvest Oranges by Machine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Little has changed over the past few  
hundred years in how oranges are picked. People climb up a ladder, 
handpick the fruit into bags and later dump them into bins. 
</P>
<P>
	All that may be about to change.  
</P>
<P>
	The race is on to develop a machine that can pick the fruit off  
of Florida's largest orange trees. Finding a mechanical harvester 
is a top priority for the Florida Department of Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers say the labor pool of human pickers is shrinking from  
the federal government's crackdown on illegal immigrants, costing 
the industry $54 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus officials worry that, without enough pickers, growers  
will be forced to leave oranges on trees. They also believe that 
mechanical harvesting will lower costs for Florida growers and keep 
them competitive with Brazil, the world's largest orange producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The citrus department has earmarked $2.5 million in next year's  
budget for research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting a fruit harvester is priority No. 1,'' said Joseph  
Marshburn, a member of the Florida Citrus Commission, the governing 
board that sets policy in Florida's citrus industry. ``We want 
something that works, is fast and commercial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmworker advocates dispute growers' claims that there is a  
labor shortage and view efforts to develop a mechanical harvester 
as a way for growers to avoid paying competitive wages. 
</P>
<P>
	At least half of Florida's orange pickers are undocumented,  
illegal workers. Growers are unwilling to pay higher wages to 
career pickers, traditionally middle-aged black Americans, now that 
their source of cheap labor is drying up, said Greg Schell, an 
attorney for the Migrant Farmworkers Justice Project in Belle 
Glade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have determined it would be cheaper to use a mechanical  
harvester,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanical harvesting is just in its infancy. But some citrus  
officials believe 75 percent of Florida's processed orange crop 
could be harvested by machine in 10 years. That is a considerable 
portion of the Florida orange crop considering almost all of the 
state's oranges are processed, or used for juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Oranges are the state's biggest crop, representing $1.1 billion  
of Florida's $6.2 billion in agricultural cash receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	A mechanical harvester would only be used on oranges headed for  
the juice processor. Oranges intended for table fruit would still 
be picked by hand to prevent bruising. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, mechanical harvesters would likely only be  
used in Florida. Most of the oranges produced in Arizona, 
California and Texas are sold as table fruit. Grapefruit would 
still be picked by hand since most of Florida's grapefruit crop is 
used as table fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	For years farmers have used mechanical harvesters for crops such  
as cherries, olives and apples. But oranges have proved tougher to 
pick by machine because their stems are thicker than other fruit, 
said Galen Brown, the state citrus department's harvesting program 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Six types of mechanical harvesters are being developed under the  
aegis of the citrus department. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only one type, known as the ``trunk, shake and catch''  
model, is available for commercial use. This past season those 
machines were used to harvest only 5,000 acres of Florida's 658,000 
acres of orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trunk, shake and catch'' machines comes in two parts. On  
one side of a tree, a mechanical ``shaker'' on wheels grasps the 
trunk of the tree with two rubber donut-like hands and shakes the 
tree. On the other side is a long, mobile conveyor belt that 
catches the oranges and moves them into a bin. The bin is 
periodically dumped into a large truck. The shaker and catcher move 
along a grove row in tandem. The machines can only be used on trees 
with trunks 18 inches or larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Other mechanical harvesters being developed look like something  
from a sci-fi movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``canopy area shake and catch'' model, from afar, looks like  
toothbrush bristles attached to a crane. The ``continuous travel 
canopy shake and catch'' model has porcupine-like spikes that move 
through trees like a paint rollerbrush. 
</P>
<P>
	A few growers that have decided to try mechanical harvesting are  
taking a wait-and-see attitude and are leasing instead of buying 
the machines, which can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The various machines under development will reduce a grower's  
harvesting costs anywhere from 10 percent to 75 percent and are 
three to four times more productive than handpickers, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton Enterprises, the Chico, Calif.-based manufacturer which  
developed one of the ``trunk, shake and catch'' models, estimates 
that harvesting costs using a standard crew of 20 to 30 men can 
reach up to $558 per acre. Mechanical harvesting, which requires 
only three operators, would cost $248 an acre, according to the 
company's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers in other countries, most notably France, Italy,  
Israel and Spain, have tried developing mechanical citrus 
harvesters but with little success. Brazil, Florida's main 
competitor for orange production, is looking to the Sunshine State 
to see how mechanical harvesting fares, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does succeed, it could be the biggest change to orange  
picking in Florida since the Spanish began harvesting the fruit in 
the 16th century, said John Attaway, a retired University of 
Florida professor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be the first change. Period,'' said Attaway, who  
also is former director of scientific research at the citrus 
department. ``We've always picked it by hand.''

<HEADLINE> Sandeno Earns Title in 400M Medley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kaitlin Sandeno caught a bus and arrived here  
at 6 a.m. Sunday from Winnipeg, Manitoba, after winning two gold 
medals at the Pan American Games last week. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was able to catch her, however, in the 400-meter  
individual medley Sunday in the Phillips 66 National Swimming 
Championships at the University of Minnesota Aquatic Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno's time of 4 minutes, 42.92 seconds earned the  
16-year-old Lake Forest, Calif., native her second national title. 
She swam in the preliminaries just hours after getting to the Twin 
Cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Menlo Park, Calif., native Jenny Thompson recorded another  
national championship by winning the 200-meter freestyle in 
2:00.19. It was the 22nd career national title for Thompson, 26, 
who moved into 10th place on the career list. She is the winningest 
active swimmer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Benko, Saturday's victor in the 200 backstroke, was the  
runner-up in 2:00.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugur Taner won his second title in as many nights, taking the  
200-meter freestyle championship away top-seeded Chad Carvin. Taner 
swam a 1:49.19 to follow up Saturday's 200 butterfly victory. 
Carvin was third (1:49.78) behind Josh Davis, who finished in 
1:49.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Margalis, 17, earned a victory in the men's 400  
individual medley with a time of 4:19.70. Coming in second was 
top-seeded Eric Donnelly (4:20.42), who arrived from Winnipeg on 
the same bus as Sandeno early Sunday morning. Donnelly won the 
silver medal at the Pan Am Games in the same event at 4:17.86. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,400 swimmers are competing in the five-day meet, which  
should produce 10 additional qualifiers for the U.S. team at the 
Pan Pacific games Aug. 22-28 in Sydney, Australia.

<HEADLINE> US To Make Example of bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch says the United States knows  
where Osama bin Laden is, generally knows what the alleged 
terrorist leader is doing and is aware that top Arabs are funneling 
money to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have the finances, he does have some support around  
the world that literally could cause him to penetrate our country 
as well as others,'' Hatch, a member of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee and GOP presidential aspirant, said Sunday on CBS' ``Face 
the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Utah Republican predicted the United States eventually  
will get to the expatriate Saudi and make an example of him. He 
refused to say whether that might include assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment on that,'' Hatch said, but he added: ``The  
CIA, FBI and others are right on top of it. We know where he is, we 
basically know what his activities are, and we've just got to stay 
ever alert. ... This menace has got to end someday, and I think 
we'll find some way of doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By presidential directive, U.S. intelligence agencies are  
forbidden from using assassination as a tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, we're going to get (bin Laden),'' Hatch said.  
``And ultimately, we're going to make an example of a person who 
literally is causing death all over the world, or at least trying 
to cause death all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's comments came a year after 224 people, including 12  
Americans, were killed in bomb attacks on two U.S. embassies in 
Africa. U.S. officials say the almost simultaneous bombings on Aug. 
7, 1998, were orchestrated by bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden ``is one of the wealthiest terrorists and one of the  
most respected by those who love terrorism,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have some problems ... but we've kept him in check  
geographically. We're putting a lot of pressure on him all over the 
world.'' Bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Americans have a mistaken idea that bin Laden's  
organization, known as Al Khada, Arabic for ``the base,'' is a 
well-oiled terrorism machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Khada is kind of loosely organized, but it's got a lot of  
fanatical people in it who basically think they're doing Allah's 
will, some of them,'' Hatch said. ``Some of them are just plain 
downright hardhearted criminals.''

<HEADLINE> Gianni Versace Home Goes on Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The palatial villa that was home to  
fashion designer Gianni Versace is on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The asking price for the 12-bedroom, 13 bath mansion in Miami's  
trendy South Beach is $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of the slain fashion mogul had owned the 13,250  
square-foot Mediterranean-style palazzo across from the Atlantic 
Ocean since Andrew Cunanan shot Versace to death at the house's 
gate two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fantastic residence, but the family focus has shifted  
and the South Beach house is underutilized,'' Versace family 
spokesman Lou Colasuonno said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The family is based in Milan, and when they are in the United  
States, most of the time is spent in New York,'' he said. ``That's 
why they are selling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The villa was filled with ornate antiques and exotic art,  
including paintings of scenes from ancient Greece and the busts of 
historical figures from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to 
Chinese sage Confucius. Whether the furniture and art will be sold 
with the home wasn't disclosed.

<HEADLINE> White House Mulls Energy Shuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House hasn't decided whether to veto  
a proposal that would create a semiautonomous agency to protect 
nuclear weapons programs and laboratories, Chief of Staff John 
Podesta said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at it right now,'' Podesta said on NBC's ``Meet  
the Press.'' The Clinton administration has some problems with the 
proposal, he said, ``but whether it rises to the level that we're 
going to have to veto'' remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate conferees approved as part of a final $288.8  
billion defense spending bill a provision to create an agency 
within the Energy Department to deal with nuclear weapons programs 
including the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Nuclear Security Administration would remain under  
the energy secretary but largely would control its own budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said he would go along with  
a new agency but only one that does not sap the authority of the 
energy secretary and place security and counterintelligence 
responsibilities outside the agency.

<HEADLINE> Many Questioned in Olympics Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Federal investigators have questioned a  
number of people in their investigation of Salt Lake City's Olympic 
bribery scandal, from private consultants to higher-ups in the 
city's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Even former Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank  
Joklik has been interviewed since the U.S. Department of Justice 
probe into an alleged $1 million vote buying scheme began, the 
Deseret News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik voluntarily submitted to an interview in February, said  
his lawyer, Mark Tuohey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank's been cooperating with anyone who wants to talk to  
him,'' Tuohey said. But he also said the interview was ``pretty 
generic background about the organization and how it functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, Joklik's predecessor at SLOC and the head of the Salt  
Lake bid committee until he was ousted amid allegations of 
wife-beating, has not been questioned, according to his attorney, 
Tom Schaffer. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's name came up last week, when Utah businessman David E.  
Simmons pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons admitted in court that he hired the son of International  
Olympic Committee member Kim Un-yong at the request of the bid 
committee, then claimed as a business expense the money funneled to 
him to pay his salary. Simmons said Welch asked him to hire John 
Kim for the sham job. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is just ``the first charge in the investigation,'' said  
Myron Marlin, the spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	While Welch hasn't talked, plenty of others have been called in  
by the FBI and other agencies, including two members of the City 
Council, Joanne Milner and Deeda Seed, who are outspoken critics of 
SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City attorney Roger Cutler said he met with  
investigators at least six months ago. Much of the discussion, he 
said, centered around the city's hiring the son of a former IOC 
member from Swaziland, David Sibandze. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze resigned his membership after it was revealed his son,  
Sibusiso Sibandze, worked as an intern in City Hall in 1993 and 
1994. Cutler told investigators Sibandze was paid by the city and 
did legitimate work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed satisfied after that,'' Cutler said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Roger Black, director of management services for the city,  
said three federal agents interviewed him a few months ago, mostly 
about Sibandze. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the person on the city staff who was ultimately  
responsible in Sibusiso's employment,'' Black said. ``I guess 
that's what they were interested in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation has roamed far afield, with a Canadian  
consultant and New Jersey travel business owner also being 
contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahmoud El Farnawani, who has a heart condition that keeps him  
from traveling, was interviewed by federal agents at his Toronto 
home a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC Board of Ethics report found El Farnawani earned nearly  
$150,000 working for the committee, lobbying North African and 
other IOC members. His targets included Bashir Attarbulsi of Libya, 
who resigned after it was revealed his son attended Brigham Young 
University at bid committee expense. 
</P>
<P>
	El Farnawani said he had nothing to do with that arrangement,  
but would not say what he discussed with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a grilling,'' said El Farnawani's attorney, David M.  
Goodman. ``They just wanted to hear his whole story, what his 
involvement was with (the bid committee) when he worked for them.''

<HEADLINE> Museum Exhibit for Lenny Bruce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Foul-mouthed, opinionated, too shocking for  
prime time -- Lenny Bruce has been called them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Now an exhibit at the Museum of Television and Radio is honoring  
the comedian as one of the foremost personalities and provocateurs 
of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two Five Letter Words: Lenny Bruce'' features the complete  
collection of the comedian's television appearances. There's his 
vaudeville act on ``Arthur Godfrey and Friends'' in 1949; his 
constitutional rights activism on the Steve Allen show; and his odd 
clowning on Canada's ``Close Up!'' in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``The liberal press wrote that Bruce represented a new approach  
to comedy, but the conservative press wrote him off as a waste of 
time,'' said writer Nat Hentoff, whose interview with Bruce is 
included in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The comic was hounded by authorities for his political and  
social satire and his use of obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to push the rules but he was clearly aware of his  
limits, and that didn't necessarily stop him,'' Robert Batscha, 
president of the museum, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit continues until Oct. 3.

<HEADLINE> Wade Boggs Homers for 3000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs became the first player  
to homer for his 3,000th hit, kissing home plate Saturday night to 
cap an amazing three-day run of baseball milestones. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th hit and two days after  
Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run, Boggs reached his lifelong 
goal and celebrated with an emotional trip around the bases. He is 
the 23rd major-leaguer to reach the 3,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs already had a pair of RBI singles for the Tampa Bay Devil  
Rays when he hit a hanging, 2-2 breaking ball from Cleveland's 
Chris Haney over the right-field wall in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs pointed upwards -- a tribute to his mother, killed in a  
1986 car accident -- as he approached second base. A few steps from 
home, Boggs again pointed up. He then got down on his knees and 
kissed home plate as his teammates waited to embrace him. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks were set off at Tropicana Field when Boggs homered,  
and a scramble developed for the historic ball. Several fans ran 
onto the field, but security guards stopped them from reaching 
Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, 41, is a five-time AL batting champion. He grew up about  
20 miles from Tropicana Field and played Little League ball in 
Tampa.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Raises Money for Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- More than 1,000 fans turned out to help golf  
star Tiger Woods raise money for his foundation benefiting 
underprivileged young people. One of his biggest fans -- singer 
Celine Dion -- shared the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not only the No. 1 golfer, he's the No. 1 human being,''  
Dion said of Woods during her 30-minute performance at Tiger Jam 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual event raises money for the California-based Tiger  
Woods Foundation, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion's voice broke with emotion as she recounted her  
husband-manager, Rene Angelil, being diagnosed with cancer four 
months ago. Angelil had a skin cancer removed from his neck and is 
undergoing radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion said she and her husband are big Tiger Woods fans, so a  
message he left on their answering machine came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should have seen Rene's face,'' she recalled of the  
message. She said Woods called three times in the next three weeks 
to inquire about Angelil's progress and boost his morale. 
</P>
<P>
	``You lifted his spirit up so much,'' Dion told Woods.  
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has raised some $4 million, according to Woods'  
father, Earl Woods, who heads the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night's event included an auction of a dozen items that  
raised $242,500. Fetching the most money was a round of golf with 
Woods at his home course in Orlando, Fla. that went for $65,000. A 
limited edition Jeep Cherokee drew $44,000 and a guitar autographed 
by the Eagles rock group brought $31,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rio Suite Hotel and Casino, host of the event, presented a  
check for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said the foundation gives disadvantaged youngsters a  
chance to play golf, with him teaching many of the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said that while teaching disadvantaged kids the game of  
golf, he was pitching another more important lesson -- ``that they 
can make something of themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not about golf, we're about humanitarianism,'' Woods  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised from this year's Tiger Jam will provide funds for  
seven youth charities in California, Nevada and Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Alabama Shootings Not Random </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The man accused of killing three people  
at two companies in suburban Pelham was apparently angry over his 
assigned trucking routes, The Birmingham News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Eugene Miller is charged with capital murder in the  
Thursday shootings at Ferguson Enterprises and Post Airgas. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not commented on a possible motive for the  
killings of Lee Holdbrooks and Christopher Scott Yancy at Ferguson 
Enterprises and the shooting minutes later of Terry Jarvis, a 
former coworker of Miller, at Post Airgas. 
</P>
<P>
	However, officials have said they believe the killings were not  
random, noting two other workers at the companies were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	A close friend of Holdbrooks, Chad Ingram of Alabaster, said  
Miller's anger involved job assignments at Ferguson, the newspaper 
said. The company is a wholesale distributor serving the 
construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy got mad because he wasn't getting the (delivery)  
routes he wanted'' Ingram told the newspaper. ``He was thinking Lee 
was getting better routes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted at his home Sunday, Ingram talked only briefly because  
he was leaving to be a pallbearer at Holdbrooks' funeral, but he 
said he understood that longer routes involved fewer stops and less 
loading and unloading than the shorter routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 34, of Billingsley, and Holdbrooks were both route  
drivers for Ferguson. Yancy was a dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess (Miller) felt Scott and Lee were in cahoots about  
(Holdbrooks) getting a better route,'' Ingram told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby County District Attorney Robby Owens would not confirm or  
deny Ingram's information, but said Saturday that it was consistent 
with what has been said in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson has referred all calls to its headquarters in Newport  
News, Va. Calls to a representative there were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Shelby County Jail in Columbiana, Barbara Miller was  
silent as she waited to see her son Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller's siblings described him as a loving family member  
who adored children. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not my brother in there,'' said Cheryl Connell,  
Miller's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's too good with children,'' said Jeff Carr, Miller's  
brother. ``That's not him.''

<HEADLINE>  Boggs' 3,000th Caps Historic Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs was still glowing.  
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the 3,000-hit club strolled into the Tampa  
Bay Devil Rays clubhouse Sunday morning, eager to get on with the 
rest of a career he has no plans to end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He's 41 and no longer contending for batting titles, however the  
home run he hit Saturday night for his greatest individual 
accomplishment raised his average to .297. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs doubled for No. 3,001 in his only at-bat Sunday before  
taking the rest of the day off against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said 3,000 hits is not a termination point in my  
career,'' he said, adding that he hasn't given a lot of thought to 
how much longer he'd like to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to rip the shirt off of me. If I'm  
hitting .300 and still performing, and the game's still fun, I'll 
continue to play if they'll have me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic hit, on a 2-2 pitch from Chris Haney in the sixth  
inning of a 15-10 loss to the Indians, capped a remarkable 
three-day run of baseball history. And it was perhaps fitting that 
hit No. 3,000 was a home run, only the second of the season for 
Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire began the three-day stretch Thursday night in St.  
Louis by becoming only the 16th player to hit 500 career home runs. 
McGwire, who set the single-season mark of 70 last year, added No. 
501 later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Tony Gwynn, who broke into the major leagues three  
months after Boggs, got his 3,000th hit, lining a single in the 
first inning in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Saturday and Boggs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Three milestones in three nights, that's pretty amazing,''  
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball history, the closest two hitters have reached such  
milestones was in 1970 when Ernie Banks slugged his 500th home run 
on May 12 and Hank Aaron got his 3,000th hit five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, Eddie Collins got his 3,000th hit 17 days after Tris  
Speaker had passed the milestone, until now the closest two players 
had reached that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken could become the third player to reach 3,000 this  
season. The Baltimore star, currently on the disabled list, needs 
32 hits to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just as McGwire added homer No. 501 before his game ended,  
Gwynn used his 3,000th hit as the beginning of another multi-hit 
contest. The San Diego right fielder collected four hits and left 
the game in the eighth inning with a career total of 3,003. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's big home run came against the Padres. And before Gwynn  
left St. Louis, McGwire made sure to collect a souvenir for his 
son, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Gwynn and I swapped jerseys,'' he said. ``I don't get  
anything for myself. I do everything for Matt. So I had him sign 
it, `To Matt.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs put a special stamp on his moment, too, becoming the first  
player to homer for No. 3,000. He capped an emotional trip around 
the bases by getting down on his knees and kissing home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people got caught up in the moment as Boggs stood in  
for the big at-bat. While the fans gave him a huge ovation, the 
public-address announcer forgot to call Boggs' name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had always said this is not a race. That if it was a race,  
then it would have meant something more special,'' Boggs said, 
alluding to the attention he and Gwynn received pursuing the 
milestone at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now to do something no one else has ever done, that's  
special. If I had just gotten a little bloop hit or something like 
that, I would have just been Wade Boggs, the singles hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs spent the first 11 seasons of his career with the Boston  
Red Sox and the next five with the New York Yankees. The 
opportunity to chase 3,000 before family and lifelong friends is 
one of the reasons he signed with the expansion Devil Rays last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropicana Field is about 20 miles from where he grew up and  
played Little League ball in Tampa, and the crowd of 39,512 that 
witnessed history included his father, wife and 12-year-old son, 
Brett. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs said the moment was more than the realization of a dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a thousand times more. You couldn't imagine. When  
you're running around the bases, you're not even touching the 
ground. You're just floating around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth, I thought I was going to sit down there  
and start crying like a baby. I shed a couple of tears when I 
hugged my father, but I was happy more than anything ... It was 
just a fantastic moment. It really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs went home to celebrate and watch highlights of the game  
with 50 to 60 close friends and family members. Tampa mayor Dick 
Greco, a neighbor, showed up at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had tickets for (Sunday),'' Boggs said. ``I said: `Sorry,  
mayor. I did it last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-time All-Star walked into the clubhouse seven hours  
later, carrying a bat and a new pair of shoes to replace the ones 
he used on the most memorable night of an 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a blast. Just the amount of adrenaline that's still  
in my body. I couldn't wait to wake up this morning and come to the 
ball park,'' Boggs said, conceding a tremendous burden had been 
lifted off his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	A superstitious person who joked that he may now change a  
well-known pregame routine that includes a meal with chicken, Boggs 
had worried that an injury or accident might prevent him from 
reaching 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept thinking about Roberto Clemente, who reached the  
milestone on the last day of the 1972 season and died in a plane 
crash that winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you get there,'' Boggs said, ``until you really seize  
the moment, everything is a panic attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays hold an option on his contract for 2000 and have  
yet to talk to him about next year. One thing Boggs knows is he's 
not ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some great names to pass,'' he said. ``You look at  
the list and it's phenomenal. They are some of the greatest players 
to ever play this game, and I'm so fortunate to be in the same 
breath with those guys.''

</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the 3,000-hit club strolled into the Tampa  
Bay Devil Rays clubhouse Sunday morning, eager to get on with the

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Tax Cut Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he remains optimistic  
about reaching a tax-reduction agreement with congressional 
Republicans but cannot accept cuts that threaten Social Security, 
Medicare and other vital programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking the 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut bill passed by  
Congress last week, Clinton told the nation's governors Sunday he 
believes he has a winning formula to properly divide projected 
surpluses among tax cuts, debt reduction and popular federal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we ought to blow it,'' he said. ``And if I can  
stop it, I will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the president said he remains optimistic that a compromise  
can be reached. ``I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people 
are about the prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am 
determined to try to do it,'' he said at the National Governors' 
Conference meeting in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He also made clear he is optimistic he'll be able to make the  
case that a huge tax cut now would be bad for the economy and for 
the investments the nation needs to make in its own future 
prosperity and success. 
</P>
<P>
	And he told the governors the Republican bill would lead to huge  
reductions in spending on Medicare, farm programs and other items 
critical to the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP tax cut is based on projected budget surpluses that so  
far exist only on paper, Clinton said. ``So one of two things will 
happen,'' he said. ``We would either have huge cuts in all these 
things -- huge -- or we would have a reversion to past policies. We'd 
go back to deficit spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans contended that Clinton and fellow Democrats would  
say anything to avoid shrinking the size of government and reducing 
spending. ``The president wants more money so he can spend more 
money,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., told the governors just before 
Clinton spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal on taxes and budget surpluses came after a busy  
weekend back home in Little Rock, Ark., where he and Vice President 
Al Gore joined forces for the first time at a fund-raiser that 
collected some $300,000 for Gore's 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He was continuing a busy travel schedule this week, including a  
flight to Atlanta today to address the American Bar Association and 
present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former President 
Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.

<HEADLINE> Grant Pokes Fun at Running Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Run Hugh, run!  
</P>
<P>
	For one scene in his latest movie ``Mickey Blue-Eyes,'' Hugh  
Grant draws from a past filming experience to help inspire his 
athletic abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a scene in (Four Weddings and A Funeral) where I  
chased Andie MacDowell and I was very humiliated when the director 
came up to me and said 'Hugh, could you please run like a man?' 
Which I thought I was,'' Grant says in the September issue of 
Cosmopolitan magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since then, everyone's always begged me not to run in films,  
so I thought 'Let's write a whole scene about it.' Let the whole 
world laugh with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result? A segment where Grant speeds down the street so  
awkwardly with co-star Jeanne Tripplehorn that it looks like his 
legs are tied together.

	CEBU, Philippines (AP) -- Rescuers recovered three more bodies on  
Sunday from the rubble of a building that collapsed while under 
construction in the central Philippines, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five bodies have been found so far, including that of a worker  
who had made tapping sounds a day earlier, police investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight workers are believed still trapped in the ruins  
of the four-story building, which collapsed before dawn Saturday in 
Cebu City apparently due to a damaged main concrete column. Eleven 
other workers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Sison, one of those leading the search and rescue  
efforts, said rescuers heard somebody tapping an object against a 
thick concrete slab Saturday morning, prompting rescuers to hasten 
efforts to bore a hole through it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers managed to find the worker Sunday but he was already  
dead, Sison said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said hope was fading that other workers could still be found  
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Cebu, 360 miles south of Manila, is the country's second-largest  
urban center.
