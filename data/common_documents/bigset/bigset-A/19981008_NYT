USC'S MORTON EXPECTS TO MISS CAL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC tailback Chad Morton said it would take a
``miracle'' for his strained back to feel well enough for him to
play against California on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Morton did not practice Wednesday, instead receiving treatment
from the USC trainers. He missed last week's game against Arizona
State and has not played since the third quarter of the Florida
State game.
</P>
<P>
   And even USC coach Paul Hackett was sounding less optimistic
that the Trojans' starting tailback would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to play a second game without him,'' Hackett said.
``I don't expect him to practice this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he is beginning to worry about Morton's
conditioning becoming an issue if he misses much more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting to that point,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger question is how USC's rushing game, which was
nonexistent against Arizona State, will respond without Morton for
a second straight week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know where we are offensively without Chad,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said either junior Petros Papadakis or freshman Frank
Strong would start. That's a slight change, because Hackett stated
firmly last week that Papadakis would start against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Matt Welch also missed practice with some
``bumps and bruises,'' but Hackett said he would practice today and
play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   No-fault play: Hackett said he did not believe Arizona State's
Grey Ruegamer made an illegal block from behind on defensive end
Marc Matock, on the play where Matock broke his ankle last
Saturday. He also said the play was not ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hackett said USC will still ask for a rules
interpretation about the play from the Pacific-10.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the troops: Always searching for a way to motivate the
Trojans, Hackett found some bulletin-board material Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal's made a lot of noise that we are not the premier team,''
Hackett said. ``That we have crumbled and we're no longer a
dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's Oakland Tribune, Cal linebacker Sekou Sanyika
said: ``They're no different than the Beavers or the Ducks or the
Huskies. They're on the rise, trying to restore tradition. But that
all seems to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Justin Vedder was even more emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the team they once were, obviously,'' Vedder said.
``But they're still arrogant. You don't really like playing a team
that already thinks that they're the national champions.... It's
personal with 'SC. It's where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   Whither the tight end? With tight end Antoine Harris catching
just four passes so far, Hackett is already being quizzed by
recruits if the Trojans are ever going to start throwing to the
tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   His answer is similar to the one he gives regarding other
players who have rarely seen the ball, like wide receiver Mike
Bastianelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the offense is in its infant stages,'' Hackett
said. ``We haven't figured out how to get him out in the passing
game. It's a reaction to the Florida State game, bringing everyone
in to block. As we feel more comfortable there, we'll throw more to
the tight end. Right now, we need to settle down the offense.''

BAD DEFENSE EXPOSES MISSED CHANCES 
 (JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS to add quotes, recast emphasis on controversial play.)  By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For six months, baseball lived _ thrived _ on
offense. The Mark and Sammy show epitomized the theme of the season
and captivated the country. Home runs, however, were not the
deciding factor in the latest game. That was the one played
Wednesday at Yankee Stadium, and the outcome turned on bunts and
lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive bunt was Travis Fryman's in the 12th inning. That
was the one that seared Chuck Knoblauch into the minds of everyone
who saw the play as the reincarnation of Fred Merkle, who didn't
touch second base on an ostensible game-winning hit in a 1908
pennant-race game, and Mickey Owen, who missed what would have been
the game-ending strikeout in the 1941 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's blunder will be the play most remembered from the
Cleveland Indians' 4-1 victory over the Yankees that tied the
American League Championship Series at one game each. Forgotten
will be the inability of Tim Raines to put down a sacrifice bunt in
the seventh inning and the unwillingness of Manager Joe Torre to
have Shane Spencer sacrifice in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who squandered another nifty pitching performance
by David Cone, struggled against Charles Nagy and six Indian relief
pitchers. They needed every scoring opportunity they could muster
to keep their post-season unbeaten streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   Sacrifice bunts in those two innings might have helped. They
might even have led to a run or runs that would have precluded the
necessity of extra innings and spared Knoblauch the grief he will
endure for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were losing, 1-0, when Bernie Williams led off the
seventh with a single and Tino Martinez walked. Raines, the next
batter, was called on to sacrifice the runners to third and second.
It was an assignment he had not executed since September 1995, and
had not been asked to execute since October 1996. The rust showed.
</P>
<P>
   With one ball, Raines bunted but fouled off the pitch so hard
that it shot back toward the screen behind home plate as a line
drive. He got his bat in position to bunt the next pitch but pulled
the bat back only to have Ted Hendry, the plate umpire (remember
that name), call the pitch a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Raines then struck out for the third time in three times at bat.
Despite his failure to move the runners along, the Yankees scored
the tying run one out later on a double by Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   The game was still tied when Raines began the ninth with a
single. The younger, speedier Homer Bush went in to run for Raines
as Spencer went to the plate. He is the rookie who has hit all of
those home runs recently, and the manager wasn't about to ask him
to bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not have bunted a whole lot,'' Torre said later. ``A
guy that hits 30 home runs, you don't ask him to bunt.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``That is just a call on my part, and as it turned
out, it was the wrong one.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer said he hadn't been asked to bunt much in recent years,
but, he added, ``I don't mind bunting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer was not asked to bunt, not before Bush stole second,
not after. Instead, for the only time in his five at-bats, he
struck out. Brosius was walked purposely, and Jorge Posada grounded
into a double play that sent the game into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th inning of Game 4 of the 1969 World Series, Baltimore
pitcher Pete Richert fielded J.C. Martin's sacrifice bunt, threw to
first and hit Martin on the left wrist. As the ball rolled into the
outfield, Rod Gaspar scored from second, and the New York Mets won
the game, then won the next one, too, and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of the play subsequently showed that Martin had run to
first base on the fair, or wrong, side of the baseline. But the
Orioles did not notice it or argue it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees argued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Enrique Wilson at first running for Jim Thome, Fryman
bunted toward first, Martinez fielded the ball and turned and threw
to Knoblauch, who was covering first. The ball hit Fryman in the
back, right on the 7 of his uniform No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The ball caromed beyond Fryman and Knoblauch onto the infield
dirt. Instead of retrieving the ball to keep Wilson from advancing
too far, Knoblauch stood at the base pointing to where he believed
Fryman had run. Knoblauch was right about Fryman's path _ on the
fair side of the line _ but he was wrong, oh was he wrong, for
ignoring the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have an idea where the ball was,'' Knoblauch
said. ``My intentions weren't not to chase the ball. You've got to
play the play out. Everything just seemed to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson didn't. He raced all the way home with the tie-breaking
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees blamed Hendry for not calling Fryman out for
interference, but Jim Evans, the crew chief, explained that no
matter what Fryman's path to first was, the ball hit him as he
stepped on or was about to step on the base and he was entitled to
be in fair territory when he reached the base because the base was
in fair territory.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, when he pitched for the Mets, Cone pulled a
Knoblauch, holding the ball, arguing with the umpire about the call
at first and letting not one but two runs score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think much about it anymore,'' Cone said. ``It
was so long ago. At the time I stood up and took responsibility for
the blunder and put it behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   This one won't be behind Knoblauch for a long time. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Democratic Rep. Charles
Schumer are locked in an extraordinarily tight race for the U.S.
Senate in New York. The outcome apparently rests with a small group
of undecided voters, many of whom are not yet paying attention to
the contest, a statewide New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go until the election, the poll found that 60
percent of the respondents were unable to offer an opinion of
Schumer, favorable or unfavorable. At the same time, a sizable
number of voters, including some of the senator's own supporters,
have reservations about D'Amato's ethics and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, 44 percent favored Schumer and 41
percent D'Amato. Among likely voters, Schumer had 47 percent to
D'Amato's 43 percent. The poll, based on interviews with 1,066
voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's findings suggest two dynamics that will shape the
contest in its final weeks: a competition between both camps to
define Schumer's public personality among voters who do not know
him, and an attempt by the Brooklyn congressman to exploit what the
poll suggests are the liabilities D'Amato has as a three-term
Republican senator in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The race has emerged as one of the most closely watched in the
nation. D'Amato, a Republican senator in a traditionally Democratic
state, faces in Schumer his best-financed opponent since his
election in 1980. Schumer has matched D'Amato's aggressive stance
with his own forceful style.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this contest is shaping up as a replay of the 1992
race, when D'Amato ran against Robert Abrams, then the state
attorney general. A Times poll in the third week of October 1992
found D'Amato in an effective tie with his Democratic challenger.
D'Amato ultimately defeated Abrams by a single percentage point
after a searing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest Times/CBS News poll points to several ways in
which this contest is different from 1992, and that is not
necessarily good news for D'Amato. An equal number of voters now
view D'Amato and Schumer as serious in dealing with crime, evidence
that the nine-term congressman has achieved some success in
neutralizing a traditionally Republican issue.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato is widely viewed as ``the kind of person who gets
things done for the voters'' _ clearly one of his biggest
advantages _ a substantial number of respondents said that he was
lacking in honesty and integrity, and that he did not care ``about
the needs and problems of people like you.'' Schumer scored
strongly on both measures.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most strikingly, D'Amato's intense effort to derail
Schumer's campaign with a series of attacks in the last three weeks
_ from portraying him as a liberal to spotlighting votes he has
missed in Washington as he campaigned in New York this year _ has
yet to show any obvious effect on the public's view of the
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 percent of respondents had an unfavorable rating of
Schumer, compared with 22 percent who had a favorable rating. By
contrast, in a poll in the third week of October 1992, Abrams was
viewed unfavorably by 1 in 3 voters.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' support varied by region of the state. Schumer
leads D'Amato two to one, 61 percent to 27 percent, in New York
City, and D'Amato leads Schumer by 48 percent to 35 percent
upstate. But D'Amato, who is from Long Island, is almost tied in
the New York City suburbs, with 46 percent to 41 percent for
Schumer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   D'Amato began broadcasting advertisements this week accusing
Schumer of being hostile to suburban voters, based on votes he had
cast in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every measure that pollsters use to analyze an
election _ registered voters, likely voters, and taking into
account who undecided New Yorkers might be leaning toward _ this
contest is a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News statewide telephone poll was conducted from
last Thursday through Tuesday with 1,461 adults, of whom 1,066 said
they were registered to vote. With a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points, Schumer could be ahead by as
much as nine points among registered voters, or D'Amato could be
ahead by 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a clear public opinion about Schumer comes
despite months of advertisements by the congressman intended to
improve his credentials among voters, and three weeks of
commercials by D'Amato intended to tear them down. Despite all
that, nearly two-thirds said they did not hold a firm opinion of
Schumer, favorable or unfavorable. Even among those voters,
however, 41 percent said they expected to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The finding that so few people have a well-formed opinion of
Schumer reflects the fact that 39 percent said that they have paid
little attention to the contest for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, that should start to change, with both
campaigns escalating their media attacks, and the contests
receiving more intense coverage from New York newspapers and
television stations that have largely ignored it so far.
</P>
<P>
   The voters who have yet to form an opinion about Schumer are an
obvious target for both candidates. The need to influence this bloc
accounts for D'Amato's aggressive attempt to discredit his opponent
from the start of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato would appear to have an advantage in that regard, if
only because he has far more money than Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schumer's position today is reminiscent of that of George
Pataki when he was the Republican gubernatorial candidate
challenging Gov. Mario Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, in 1994. In
October of that year, 49 percent of respondents had no opinion of
Pataki, and at the time, Cuomo was in a dead heat, 44 to 41, with
Pataki, who went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers continue to have ambivalent feelings about D'Amato,
who has been a dominant figure in state politics since he defeated
Sen. Jacob Javits in the 1980 Republican primary. D'Amato is viewed
favorably by 27 percent and unfavorably by 36 percent, virtually
the same marks he received six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, 51 percent agreed that D'Amato is ``good at getting
things done for voters,'' and that is expected to be a central
argument of his appeal for a fourth term. Only 32 percent said the
same about Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   But 45 percent of D'Amato's own supporters said they were voting
for him with reservations, compared with 24 percent of Schumer's
supporters. More ominously for the senator, among undecided voters,
31 percent said they had an unfavorable view of D'Amato, compared
with 9 percent who viewed him favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has been there for a long time,'' said Kevin Byrne
of Hempstead, N.Y., a residential property manager who said he was
undecided, and who spoke in a follow-up interview. ``For as many
good things he has done, he's done equally bad.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are split about whether D'Amato has the ``honesty
and integrity you would like to see in a United States senator'':
41 percent said he did and 44 percent said he did not.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 44 percent said Schumer had those qualities and 19
percent said he did not. And 40 percent of respondents said that
they believed that D'Amato did not care ``about the needs and
problems of people like yourself,'' and 22 percent had the same
opinion about Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll found several instances in which
opposing views between the candidates might make a difference. For
example, two-thirds of respondents say the sale of handguns should
be banned; Schumer supports gun control while D'Amato opposes it.

</P>
<P>
   In the poll, 51 percent agreed that D'Amato is ``good at getting
things done for voters,'' and that is expected to be a central
argument of his appeal for a fourth term. Only 32 percent said the
same about Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   But 45 percent of D'Amato's own supporters said they were voting
for him with reservations, compared with 24 percent of Schumer's
supporters. More ominously for the senator, among undecided voters,
31 percent said they had an unfavorable view of D'Amato, compared
with 9 percent who viewed him favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has been there for a long time,'' said Kevin Byrne
of Hempstead, N.Y., a residential property manager who said he was
undecided, and who spoke in a follow-up interview. ``For as many
good things he has done, he's done equally bad.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are split about whether D'Amato has the ``honesty
and integrity you would like to see in a United States senator'':
41 percent said he did and 44 percent said he did not.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 44 percent said Schumer had those qualities and 19
percent said he did not. And 40 percent of respondents said that
they believed that D'Amato did not care ``about the needs and
problems of people like yourself,'' and 22 percent had the same
opinion about Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll found several instances in which
opposing views between the candidates might make a difference. For
example, two-thirds of respondents say the sale of handguns should
be banned; Schumer supports gun control while D'Amato opposes it.

MARTINEZ STUCK IN AUTUMNAL SWOON 
 (JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS to add fresh quotes from Martinez, recast emphasis
throughout.)   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tino Martinez admitted that the fateful and forgettable sequence
in the 12th inning of Wednesday's game felt as if it were
unraveling in slow motion. Dreary plays that help lose games can
feel that way because players replay them in their minds. Every
time Martinez replayed the bunt that doomed the Yankees, he wished
that he could punch rewind, pause or delete to do something about
Cleveland's 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was much too late to erase Travis Fryman's nifty bunt,
Martinez's misplaced throw or Chuck Knoblauch's inexplicable brain
cramp. The game-altering and maybe even series-altering play felt
like slow motion to Martinez, because that is how the usually sharp
Yankees dealt with it.
</P>
<P>
   They were too slow and too sluggish, especially for a critical
Game 2 of the American League Championship Series. As Fryman's bunt
hugged the first-base line, Martinez hesitated before charging in
for it. Once Martinez scooped it up and looked to first, he could
not see if Knoblauch was covering the base because Fryman was
running inside the baseline, obstructing his view. Martinez tried
to throw the ball over Fryman's left shoulder, but it caromed off
the runner's back and rolled toward the outfield. Knoblauch, who
was expecting the umpires to rule interference, amazingly did not
pursue the ball right away and that allowed Enrique Wilson to
scamper home from first base with the second and go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all yelling, `Get the ball, get the ball,''' Martinez
said. ``It's just one of those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was being diplomatic. It was more than one of those
plays. It was one of those weird plays that has not happened to the
Yankees often and it is the reason why they tumbled to the Indians.
It was one of the reasons Martinez had a glazed look in his brown
eyes. For once, the powerful Yankees were the team that looked
stunned inside the silent clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss,'' Martinez said. ``Any time you're at home
and you go into extra innings, you've got to win those games. This
team fights. One thing we've done is bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees need to bounce back in Game 3 Friday, and they
desperately need Martinez to rebound from his prolonged post-season
funk. Even though the Yankees won the World Series in 1996, the
post-season has not been a personal dance through October for
Martinez. It has been a disaster, and Martinez's throwing error and
0-for-4 game Wednesday fit the disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Martinez batted .409 with one homer and five RBIs for
the Mariners against the Yankees in the 1995 division series, he
has been 19 for 108 (.176 batting average) with 1 homer and 4 RBI
in the post-season. In ALCS play, Martinez is only 7 for 53, and in
his last seven post-season series he has not managed a homer or an
RBI in six of them. Disastrous? Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said Martinez, who is 0 for his last
10 in the post-season. ``I feel good, I'm relaxed and, all of a
sudden, I'm trying to make things happen that are not there. I'm
swinging at 3-2 pitches that are out of the zone. I'm striking out
on bad pitches. I'm trying to do too much instead of letting things
happen and unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of evidence to prove that Martinez is
uncomfortable at the plate. With Paul O'Neill on third, one out in
the fourth and the infield drawn in, Martinez batted against
Charles Nagy with an opportunity to drive in the Yankees' first
run.
</P>
<P>
   All Martinez needed was a single or a sacrifice fly, hardly an
arduous task for a player who knocked in 123 runs in the regular
season. But Martinez popped a 180-foot fly ball to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the game because we didn't do the job,'' Martinez
said. ``We had a lot of chances to win. I know that I didn't do the
job in the fourth when I had the chance to hit a sacrifice fly.
That play didn't lose it. It was an unfortunate play at the wrong
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had another supreme chance with the score tied, 1-1, in
the eighth, two outs and runners on first and second. All Martinez
needed was a single. All he produced was air. Martinez looked edgy
against Paul Shuey and struck out on a 3-2 pitch that was near his
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of nights here, I've felt like I'm going to
make it all happen now,'' Martinez said. ``I've been forcing things
a little bit. I have to relax and take it one game at a time. I'm
trying too hard. I need to forget about my post-seasons in the past
and go out there and play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Martinez is a sensitive sort, Joe Torre turned defensive
when he was asked before the game about Martinez's disappearing
offense. He simply said, ``Tino's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he? Not really. Someone asked Martinez how difficult it is to
forget about previous post-season failures, and he candidly said,
``It's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And it just got tougher.

DUCKS NEED TO GET DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mighty Ducks executives certainly know how to defend
themselves. They defend controversial front-office personnel moves,
inexplicable coaching changes and, of course, the annual ticket
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   But can the Ducks defend their own goal and return to the
Stanley Cup playoffs next spring?
</P>
<P>
   Few outside the organization believe they can, but that's the
last of new coach Craig Hartsburg's worries as the Ducks prepare
for Saturday's season opener against the Washington Capitals and
former coach Ron Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg has been trying to instill a system that will give his
suspect defense the best possible chance of being competitive. Poor
defense was a factor in the team's slide from fourth in the Western
Conference in 1996-97 to 12th last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no magic wand,'' said Hartsburg, a former all-star
defenseman who was the fall guy for the less-than-talented Chicago
Blackhawks' failure to make the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Teemu Selanne and a healthy Paul Kariya
figures to be magical, especially since they just completed their
first training camp together.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who played in only 22 games last season, has scored 129
goals and 277 points in 220 career games. Selanne has 119 goals and
231 points in 179 games with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Selanne put together an amazing season with virtually
no offensive support. He tied Peter Bondra for the goal-scoring
title (52) and became the fourth player in NHL history to score
more than 25 percent of his team's goals (25.4).
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat Selanne insists things aren't as bleak as they might
seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic,'' he said. ``I know we have good players and I
know we don't want to go through what we did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg has tired of answering questions about the Ducks'
defense, saying, ``All everybody talks about is the defense, but we
are just trying to teach the game the way it should be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne admitted defense will be the key to any success Anaheim
might have this season. But he said patience might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a new coach comes in, it always takes time to get on the
same page,'' said Selanne of a team that never got on the same page
with Pierre Page last season. ``But when we get on it, (the team)
will take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to remember last year. This team is hungry and
wants to prove more than last year's team.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran goalie Guy Hebert describes Anaheim's 26-43-13 record
last season as a ``disaster,'' but he believes the Ducks have a
great chance to prove their doubters are all wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are picked last in pretty much everything, except for our
big line,'' said Hebert, who is being counted on to rebound from
shoulder surgery and his worst season since arriving in Anaheim.
``It's kind of nice. Now, we'll go out as the underdog in every
game and just try to prove to people we are a solid organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we can make the playoffs, but we'll have to
play up to our capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hebert will need help from a rag-tag group of
defensemen and an increased defensive commitment on the part of the
Anaheim forwards.
</P>
<P>
   There is no confusing any of the Ducks' defenders with Rob
Blake, Chris Chelios, Ray Bourque or Nicklaus Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hartsburg _ who coached Chelios for three years _ is
putting the best possible spin on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams don't have a Chelios, but that doesn't mean
they can't have a solid defense,'' Hartsburg said. ``Sometimes
having six solid guys is better than having one star.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg can only hope the approach works better this season.
Last year, the Ducks allowed 261 goals, 28 more than in '96-97.
Only Vancouver (273) and Tampa Bay (269) allowed more.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored only 205 goals (a drop of 40), but that number
should rise with the return of Kariya, a healthy year from center
Steve Rucchin, a good year from Travis Green, a possible return to
form by Tomas Sandstrom and the emergence of promising youngsters
like Johan Davidsson, Josef Marha and Frank Banham.

GORE CAMPAIGNS FOR VALLONE AND ASSAILS PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category `a')

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. _ Hoping to borrow a little star power from
the White House, gubernatorial nominee Peter Vallone campaigned
with Vice President Al Gore in western New York state Wednesday,
giving Gore a chance to take a few pokes at a possible opponent in
the 2000 presidential race, Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, a Democrat who has in recent days emphatically opposed
calls to impeach President Clinton, hopes that the continuing
popularity of the Clinton-Gore team in New York will rub off on his
struggling campaign for governor. And the vice president helped
Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, with another scarce
commodity, money, speaking at two fund-raisers for him that the
Vallone campaign said would net $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session with students at Erie County
Community College in this Buffalo suburb, and at a fund-raiser in
nearby Lancaster, Gore, without ever naming the governor,
repeatedly criticized Pataki's vetoes last April of money the
Legislature had approved for schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the vetoes of legislative funding in this state
and it causes you to wonder what is going to happen in the future
if you don't make an investment in education,'' he said. Later, he
said, ``The Republicans in Albany can't even pass a budget on
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki campaign spokesman Michael Marr defended the governor's
commitment to schools, saying, ``Last year, the state budget
increased aid to state schools by a record $850 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Republican who enjoys a 2-to-1 lead over Vallone
in most polls, has run a quiet campaign intended to make him appear
above politics, and Wednesday was another quiet day for him, with
low-profile events in Rockland and Westchester counties. But he
picked up the endorsement of the state's largest small-business
group, the New York chapter of the National Federation of
Independent Business, a potent part of his core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview published Wednesday in The New York
Observer, the governor was clearly looking past the current contest
toward 2000. He said, ``If you're governor of New York, you can't
help but think about being president of the United States,'' the
closest he has come to expressing outright interest in running for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's political advisers say that a strong victory in the
Nov. 3 election could position him as the leading presidential
candidate in the moderate wing of the party, which favors abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The aspirations of the governor and the vice president for 2000
were among many political crosscurrents at work in Wednesday's
trip.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser at Salvatore's Italian Gardens in Lancaster,
Gore, with an oblique reference to Clinton's troubles, appealed to
Democrats not to allow pessimism or indifference to keep them from
voting. In many races around the country, Democrats fear that their
voters, discouraged by the president's problems, will simply stay
home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party has a lot of ideas that are just dead
wrong, but they're very intensely in favor of those ideas,'' Gore
said. ``Ladies and gentlemen, the real question in this election is
whether or not we're willing to match their intensity with even
more of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's difficulties were amply on display here. Absent from
the Vallone-Gore events Wednesday was Buffalo Mayor Anthony
Masiello, who has endorsed Pataki. And organizers said they had
difficulty meeting the $50,000 target for Vallone's fund-raiser in
Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   But an unexpected guest did appear: state Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, whose relations with Vallone have been rocky.
Silver, who was in Buffalo for a fund-raiser for Assembly
candidates, has made a public show of mending fences with Vallone,
but some Democrats still complain that he has done nothing to help
his party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Vallone learned that he had won a round in
another struggle, to keep the New York Yankees in the Bronx. A
judge ruled that a referendum on the team's future home, which
Vallone sponsored, must appear on the Nov. 3 ballot, over the
objections of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The ruling is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure appears on the ballot, polls indicate that voters
will overwhelmingly endorse keeping the team in Yankee Stadium, and
the measure could raise voter turnout in the city, helping Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flew Wednesday afternoon from Buffalo to New York City,
where he spoke at a fund-raiser for Vallone at the Sheraton New
York Hotel in mid-town Manhattan, that Vallone aides said raised
$250,000. And later in the evening, he spoke at the annual dinner
of the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay rights group.

NORTHRIDGE HOPES RUNNING IMPROVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Weber State's Morgan Welch ran for 217
yards against Montana. Southern Utah had 493 yards rushing against
the Grizzlies. Both times Montana lost.
</P>
<P>
   Run the ball well and you can beat No.18 Montana (3-2, 1-1 Big
Sky), which is what No.23 Cal State Northridge is thinking.
However, the Matadors (3-1, 2-0) have the worst running game in the
league, which is why the coaching staff continues to tinker with
it.
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday's adjustment for CSUN should mean less time for
running back Melvin Blue and more for Jaumal Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bradley) definitely deserves some reps,'' CSUN coach Ron
Ponciano said. ``He's extremely sound on all his protections, he
catches the ball and does everything right. He deserves that
chance. I wouldn't call it a tailback by committee, but he's
deserves the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN averages 78.8 yards per game and 1.9 yards per carry. Blue,
the Matadors' leading rusher, has 283 yards. Bradley has gained 21
yards on 12 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find out if Bradley can do it because he hasn't had
the opportunity,'' CSUN offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie said.
``We want to see if Jaumal is different than Melvin running the
ball. And it gives Melvin a break and keeps him fresh for the
fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so special teams: When it comes to kicking the ball, the
Matadors are fine. It's the return aspect of the special teams that
needs some special attention.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is last in the Big Sky returning kickoffs (14.38 yards per
return) and eighth (of nine) in the conference in punt returns
(8.0).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wedge is bad,'' said CSUN assistant coach Jeff Kearin, who
heads special teams. ``We have to make some serious adjustments.
Our plan was to put bigger guys in the wedge, and it slowed us
down. But they're getting more comfortable with it and doing
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Punter Ethan Beck missed practice Wednesday with a strained
hamstring, though Ponciano expects him to play against Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Reviving a rivalry: Four of the top 12 home crowds in CSUN
history, including the school-record 7,127 eight years ago, came
against Cal Poly of San Luis Obispo. But the schools haven't met
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   However, the rivalry renews in 2000. CSUN athletic director Paul
Bubb said the schools signed a home-and-home contract with Cal Poly
for 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get that rivalry back,'' Ponciano said. ``It's a
good one.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams met every season from 1962-95 with Cal Poly winning 27
of 35 games.
</P>
<P>
   Short yardage: Defensive back James Maldonado (pinched nerve)
and nose guard Jacob Mageo (pinched nerve) both returned to
practice Wednesday.... Defensive lineman Erik Gardner (knee) was in
shoulder pads and shorts for the first time since being injured in
the season opener against Boise State. He said he expects to return
next week at Sacramento State.... Quarterback Marcus Brady and
volleyball player Laura Szymanski were named CSUN's athletes of the
month for September.

NEW DRUGS PROLONG LIVES OF AIDS PATIENTS, STATISTICS SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The number of Americans and Angelenos who died
from AIDS plunged by about half from 1996 through 1997, according
to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The disease claimed 46 percent fewer people nationwide in 1997
than it did in 1996, as powerful new drugs enabled those infected
with the human immunodeficiency virus to stay healthy longer, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, the number of deaths dropped 51 percent.
And that trend continued during the first nine months of 1998, with
38 percent fewer deaths than during the same period last year,
according to county statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging,'' said Peter Kerndt, director of the
county's HIV epidemiology program. ``We're talking about a very
significant change. ... People who have AIDS are living longer.''
</P>
<P>
   While hailing the news, AIDS researchers and activists Wednesday
noted that the estimated number of new HIV infections nationwide
has held steady at about 40,000 each year, meaning more and more
Americans are living with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   And some worried that the drop in deaths might prove temporary.
There are already signs that the constantly mutating virus is
building up resistance to the drug combinations, or ``cocktails,''
now used to keep it in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are finding the drugs aren't working,'' said
resident Dick Remley, an AIDS patient who helps run a support group
called When Meds Fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the honeymoon might be over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those concerns, the situation in Los Angeles appears, if
anything, even rosier than in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of new AIDS cases has not declined nationwide,
it has in Los Angeles County, Kerndt said. When the epidemic peaked
here in 1992, about 4,000 new AIDS cases were diagnosed, he said.
In 1997, that number fell to under 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   And while the number of deaths from AIDS nationwide only started
to decline in 1996, the drop began here two years earlier. In 1993,
2,650 people in the county died of AIDS. Last year, the number
plunged to 751.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is reflective of the success that many people have
experienced because of the new therapies available,'' said Lee
Klosinski, director of education at AIDS Project Los Angeles.
``It's an amazing return on the dollars spent on research on this
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But while those therapies can greatly extend the lives of AIDS
patients, they are not cures.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the drug combinations worked so well for Michael
Sausser of West Hollywood that tests couldn't detect the virus in
his blood. But it was still there, hiding, and eventually it came
back in spite of the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Sausser, who with Remley runs the When Meds Fail group, has
since stopped taking the medicine, which made him feel ill. For now
at least he seems to be doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the drugs that I got this far,'' said Sausser,
who was first diagnosed in 1988. ``And it's because I'm not on the
drugs that I can enjoy it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He worries about a ``second wave'' of deaths from the disease as
it builds up resistance to the latest medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are a lot of people who are living with these
drugs, going to work, but they're living in denial,'' he said.

UMPIRE SLICES IT LOWER AND WIDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BBA-YANKS-INDIANS)  
 (af)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ted Hendry, the plate umpire, interpreted the strike
zone consistently, which is exactly what players say they prefer.
But Hendry's strike zone, as always, was larger than most, perhaps
a couple of inches beyond the black border on either side of the
plate, perhaps an inch lower than most strike zones.
</P>
<P>
   These parameters changed the way Wednesday's Yankees-Indians
game was played, both benefiting and hurting both sides.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone usually relies on his slider, and yet in the early
innings, he could not maintain his mechanics, his front shoulder
flying open, and he could not control the pitch, leaving him
vulnerable; Cone needs his slider to keep opposing batters from
locking in on his fastball. He kept falling behind in the count,
against six of the first 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone and his catcher, Joe Girardi, recognized quickly that
Hendry was particularly generous calling inside strikes on
left-handed batters, and through the middle innings, Cone would
keep firing fastballs at that one spot whenever he needed a big
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw a staggering 32 pitches in the fourth inning, but
allowed just one run, on a home run by David Justice. Two of the
three outs in the inning were on called third strikes, on inside
fastballs to left-handed batters Omar Vizquel and Jim Thome.
Hendry's strike zone bought Cone time to find his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry's strike zone, too, foiled the strategy of the Yankees'
hitters, to take pitches and work Cleveland's Charles Nagy deep
into ball-strike counts. Twelve of the first 13 Yankee batters took
the first pitch, to little effect; the wider strike zone put them
on the defensive thereafter, and Nagy needed only 66 pitches to get
through the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had only three hits and _ horrors _ they trailed,
1-0, in the seventh, the first time in the entire post-season
another team held a lead against them.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams opened the seventh inning with a single,
however, and Tino Martinez drew a four-pitch walk. Yankee fans,
dormant since the early innings, roared in anticipation. The rally
appeared to crumble when Tim Raines tried unsuccessfully to drop a
sacrifice bunt _ something he had never attempted in the regular
season _ and then struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer then smashed a long drive to deep center. Perhaps
on a warmer day in July or August, the ball would have carried over
the wall and Spencer would have been responsible for a jubilant
riot in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The chilled air helped prevent the drive from departing,
however, Kenny Lofton catching it near the wall for the second out;
Williams tagged up and moved to third.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Brosius, who led the American League with a .374
average with runners in scoring position this year, pulled a high
off-speed pitch into the left-field corner, driving home Williams
with the tying run. Nagy was removed, disconsolate as he slumped
off the mound.

17 CHARGED IN BRIBERY SCHEME AT U.S. COURT IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS to add two suspects arraigned Wednesday, quotes from
informant, names of six defendants.) 
 (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that he had found corruption in his own
backyard, the chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn charged
Wednesday that six federal employees had taken bribes from
contractors on renovation and repair jobs in federal buildings,
including some payoffs received in the halls of the courthouse
where the case will be tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what accounts for the brazenness,'' said Zachary
Carter, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. Carter said that a two-year
undercover investigation had found that dozens of the illegal
payoffs _ some of them secretly recorded by the authorities _ were
made in elevators, hallways, the boiler room and other areas of the
U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter said he was not surprised to learn that graft had
invaded the building where he and his staff also work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the federal courthouse is immune,'' he said at a
news conference in his office, in a building near the courthouse.
``It could happen anywhere.'' Carter also announced the arrests of
the federal employees and 10 private contractors charged with
paying or offering them the bribes.
</P>
<P>
   In what officials said was the largest corruption prosecution in
the history of the General Services Administration _ the agency
responsible for the buildings that federal courts and agencies
occupy _ one veteran GSA supervisor, Patrick McCosker, was said to
have received about $100,000 in bribes for helping contractors gain
renovation and maintenance jobs at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The five other agency supervisors, who like McCosker had the
title of assistant building manager, were described in court papers
as having received relatively small amounts _ ``several thousand
dollars'' or, in one case, $6,000. But one investigator, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity, said that for some of the
defendants, ``these are conservative estimates'' and that the
continuing investigation was expected to find that they had
pocketed far more. All together, investigators said, the payoffs
helped the contractors obtain millions of dollars' worth of jobs.
The assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, Leslie Cornfeld,
said the agency supervisors' salaries ranged from $45,000 to
$63,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As the defendants were arraigned in a second-floor courtroom
Wednesday, court officials and employees watched or went to get a
glimpse of those charged, some expressing shock as they recognized
McCosker, 37, and another defendant, Robin Rosado, 55, two agency
supervisors who were assigned to the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecution papers, a contractor working as an
informer said that McCosker had demanded ``10 percent of the total
amount of each contract'' that the informer received, and that
since 1993, the informer had paid McCosker about $40,000 in cash
for about $500,000 worth of jobs at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cash payments were typically made in the courthouse,
sometimes in the boiler room,'' the informer was quoted as saying.
And in one conversation with McCosker that the informer secretly
recorded, in a Manhattan restaurant in 1997, McCosker ``discussed
the problems he had disposing of the bribe money,'' according to a
prosecution affidavit. The affidavit quoted him as complaining that
he could not use the bribe money ``to pay bills or buy cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even afraid to go on vacation or anything,'' he said,
according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, prosecutors said, one of the bribes he received was a
paid family trip to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The other agency supervisors charged are Robert K. Goldberg, 42;
John P. Harris, 55; Garrick Serrano, 37, and Salvatore F. Sarro,
48.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the courthouse, the other buildings involved in what the
authorities called ``widespread bribery and kickback schemes'' are
privately owned structures, where the major tenants are federal
agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency supervisors were not operating together but were
rather engaged in separate schemes at various times between 1993
and 1997, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that sometimes the agency employees took the initiative
in soliciting bribes and kickbacks and that sometimes the
contractors did.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation leading to the charges announced
Wednesday began when a contractor, whom he would not identify,
reported to the federal agency's management that one of its
employees ``may have solicited bribes.'' The investigation, he
said, employed confidential informers whom he did not identify but
who appear to have included at least one employee of a contractor
company and one agency employee.
</P>
<P>
   The agency supervisors charged in the case, who were arrested
Wednesday and charged in criminal complaints, are all longtime
employees of the agency, with service ranging from 10 years to 23
years. The 10 contractors are affiliated with companies that do
construction and renovation, or that specialize in areas like
mechanical and electrical systems, doors and locks, and carpet
care.
</P>
<P>
   All six federal employees and three of the contractors were
arraigned Wednesday in the same Brooklyn courthouse at the center
of the alleged corruption, and all were released on $100,000 bonds
pending further court action. They were not required to enter pleas
at the arraignment, and none did. Their lawyers declined to comment
as they and their clients left the courthouse.

SKIP AWAY PURSUES THE GOLD CUP AND THE GHOST OF KELSO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The backstretch at Belmont Park was bristling
Wednesday with horses preparing to run in the five Grade I stakes
scheduled for Breeders' Cup Preview Day on Saturday. And the star
of the show, reigning in Barn 1, remained Skip Away, who can make
history three ways if he wins the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old gray, aiming for his third Gold Cup victory in a
row, would become only the second horse in racing history to win it
more than twice. He would also win his 10th straight race. And he
would pass Cigar with record earnings of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away's trainer, Sonny Hine, taking note of all the success
within reach for his horse, acknowledged that only Kelso has won
the Gold Cup more times: He won the race five straight years from
1960 through 1964, and was named Horse of the Year for five
straight years. And Hine repeated his theme that Skip Away belonged
in such Olympian company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' he said, ``Skip Away belongs with
the greatest horses. He never had a break in his training. I mean,
this horse hates time off. He laid it on the line every time he
ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why, if he can win this race again, he will be
mentioned with Kelso, who was one of my favorite horses. I think he
and Skippy have one big thing in common, and that is their
durability. They ran hard a long time, and they overcame whatever
was put in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   A small but select field appeared likely to be entered Thursday
to challenge Skip Away, including Gentlemen, the horse he outran in
the Woodward three weeks ago. The 6-year-old Argentine star had
been considered a candidate for the Kelso Handicap one week later
than the Gold Cup. But his trainer, Dick Mandella, said Wednesday
that his next target would be the Gold Cup and Skip Away. The
Breeders' Cup with its seven races worth $12 million will be held
on Nov. 7 at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I thought about it,'' Mandella said ``the more we had
nothing to gain by running in the Kelso. It's a one-turn mile, and
that wasn't going to get us ready for anything. I already know that
Gentlemen can run on grass. This way, we have a chance to go for it
all in the Jockey Club Gold Cup and still have our options open, be
it the Breeders' Cup Mile or the Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag, the British horse who ran third in the Woodward at
48-1 odds behind Skip Away and Gentlemen, held his final tuneup for
the Gold Cup. He breezed half a mile in 51 seconds and drew cheers
from his trainer, Philip Mitchell, who also threw a high salute to
Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip Away is awesome, isn't he?'' Mitchell said. ``He can do
it all, and he's probably the finest running machine I've seen in a
long time. He is like a top shelf, Formula One car.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup will be flanked by rich races run by contenders for
championships at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   For 2-year-old fillies, the $400,000 Frizette at a mile and a
sixteenth will draw a short field headed by Things Change and Oh
What a Windfall. For 2-year-old colts, the $400,000 Champagne at a
mile and a sixteenth, will be led by Lemon Drop Kid and Tactical
Cat. For top grass horses, the $500,000 Turf Classic Invitational
at a mile and a half, will feature Cetewayo and Buck's Boy. And for
fillies and mares, the $400,000 Beldame at a mile and an eighth
will feature those old rivals, Sharp Cat and Tomisue's Delight.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jockey Club Gold Cup at a mile and a quarter for $1
million, it will be Skip Away against Gentlemen and the ghost of
Kelso. &QL;

OUT OF PRISON, PRIEST REOPENS SHELTER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To federal agents and prosecutors, the Rev. Patrick
Moloney is a rogue priest who was linked to an audacious robbery
that pumped $5 million into the coffers of Irish Republican Army
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But back at his home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after
serving almost four years in prison on charges arising from the
robbery, Moloney basked Wednesday in the warmth of supporters and
neighbors who portray him as a humble defender of the poor who was
unjustly convicted because of his political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI and the prosecutors think I'm sitting on a stash of $5
million,'' the 66-year-old Melkite Catholic priest said, fingering
a religious ornament that he called his Jesus Beads. ``They would
like people to believe that I'm an international terrorist, a
Pimpernel, a master criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that God knows I was in no way implicated in
that robbery or laundering any of the money,'' he asserted in an
interview in Bonitas House, a shelter for the homeless that he
founded more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney returned to Bonitas House on Monday after completing 44
months of a maximum 51-month sentence. He will be under supervised
release by federal probation officers for three years.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a slight build, sparse sandy hair turning grey and a
cropped white beard, Moloney was ordained in the Melkite order, a
branch of the Roman Catholic Church that follows an ancient Eastern
Rite but is obedient to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in November 1993 on federal charges stemming
from a holdup by masked gunmen in January 1993 at the Brinks car
service depot in Rochester. In November 1994 he was convicted along
with another defendant on charges of conspiracy and hiding $2
million from the robbery in an apartment that he maintained for
Bonitas House in Stuyvesant Town. The remainder of the loot _ $5.2
million _ is still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney did not testify at the trial and has maintained in
interviews that he had sublet the apartment to a volunteer worker
at Bonitas and was unaware that stolen money was being kept there.
He claimed that $168,000 found in a safe at Bonitas House was money
he was safeguarding for illegal aliens, and contributions for
repairs and maintenance of the Bonitas brownstone.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Limerick, Ireland, Moloney is a naturalized citizen
and a self-described Irish nationalist who champions unification of
the Republic of Ireland with Northern Ireland. But he emphasized
that he is opposed to terrorism and is not a supporter of the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI and the prosecutors obtained a conviction by
suggesting it was all an IRA plot,'' Moloney said in a dense,
rapid-fire brogue as his supporters listened in the sparsely
furnished Bonitas living room. ``Without terrorism, there was no
case, no motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling at the notion that he has access to huge funds from the
IRA, he said that on Monday, the first day he could shed his
federal prison identification number, 28251-0545, he was able to
scrape up only $150 from his savings and from contributions given
him by supporters to buy groceries for reopening Bonitas House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no terrorist, and what happened to him was a travesty of
justice,'' said Anna Rawle, 84, a Bonitas volunteer who lives on
East Ninth Street. ``It's wonderful to have him back, and it's
amazing that he has no bitterness on how he has been treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lawler, chancellor of the Diocese of Newton, Mass., the
main Melkite Diocese in the United States, said Wednesday that
Moloney remained a priest in good standing and could resume his
clerical duties.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney said he hoped to expand Bonitas House into a study
center and retreat for clergy and other people who are unfamiliar
with the problems of inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would minister to AIDS patients. In 1993,
shortly before his arrest, he said he received a calling to assist
people with AIDS when a patient in a Veterans Administration
hospital praised him for talking to and embracing patients without
wearing a mask as most medical workers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Padre, thank you for showing me a human face,'''
Moloney recalled. ``Because people are afraid and misinformed about
AIDS, they are turning these victims into lepers.''
</P>
<P>
   The one longtime mission that Moloney will not resume is
officiating at Masses in local jails and prisons and counseling
inmates. He is barred by probation regulations from ministering to
defendants awaiting trial or convicted inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone has firsthand experience about the spiritual needs
of inmates, it certainly is me,'' he added. ``But, that's the very
place the authorities won't let me enter.''

   Marvin Traub, ringmaster of the circus known as Bloomingdale's
for 13 years before, during and after the department-store takeover
wars, is trying again. He has been named chairman of a new chain
that will sell furniture and bedding in outlet malls.
</P>
<P>
   He did not need a Rolodex of contacts to make the arrangements.
He is a director of Prime Retail, the largest owner of outlet
malls. And Financo, the investment banking firm where he has worked
since 1993, arranged the financing for the new company, Home
Company-Fine Furniture Direct.
</P>
<P>
   The first store is scheduled to open in May in San Marcos,
Texas, a long way from Italy and France, where Traub, 73, spent
last week attending to another of his ventures, a consulting
business. ``I've been having a very good time'' since leaving
Bloomingdale's in 1991, he said. ``I think that if you stop, you
get much older.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A NEW MODEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some cosmetics makers are advancing the idea that models come in
all shapes, sizes and ages. Last month, Evonne Swann, 61, who
claims to be the oldest woman to sign a beauty contract, began
appearing in ads for Oil of Olay moisturizer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Revlon has signed Emme, a plus-size model, which means size
12 and above. ``This gig is a big deal,'' she said. ``For so many
years, so many women put themselves through hell thinking if they
don't look like a 16-year-old, they're not beautiful. I kind of
finish that off, the idea that we're all included in beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A DATE IN COURT  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A first date ``turn-on'' would be ``a nice kiss good night,''
Ryan Martin, a 22-year-old club manager, told Cosmopolitan magazine
when he was selected for a special issue on America's ``most
wanted'' single men.
</P>
<P>
   That was in June. Last month, Ryan was arrested on charges of
drugging and raping a 23-year-old woman in Worcester, Mass. He
pleaded not guilty and was released on $20,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Lt. William O'Connor of the Worcester police said that
Martin met two women in a bar and took them to a restaurant he
managed after it had closed. He said that Martin served them
alcoholic drinks, followed by a cupful of a liquid Martin said had
come from a nutrition store.
</P>
<P>
   The woman Ryan is accused of raping ``felt very tired, was
unable to drive her car home and that's when they were offered a
stay at Martin's house,'' the lieutenant said. ``The next morning
the victim woke up and, thinking she may have been sexually
assaulted, went to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that hospital personnel examined her for evidence
of rape. The woman was found to have gamma-hydroxybutyrate, which
O'Connor said was a so-called date rape drug, in her bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's lawyer, Anthony Salerno, said that Martin denied
serving such a substance. He added, ``I don't think he's
acknowledging that there was even any sex.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAY IT AGAIN  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So what does Max Weinberg, the drummer in Bruce Springsteen's E
Street Band, have to say about the fact that the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame nominated Springsteen but not the band?
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face Weinberg said, ``No one deserves to be
included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame more than Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   No hard feelings?
</P>
<P>
   With a straighter face, he said, ``Like I said, no one deserves
to be included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame more than Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he and the band perform for, or with, Springsteen at the
induction ceremony?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, no one deserves to be included in the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame more than Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't this sound like a broken record?
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, and walked away.

PATAKI'S ECONOMIC ADVISER IS SUBPOENAED IN CONTRACT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Gov. George
Pataki's senior economic adviser, Charles Gargano, in their inquiry
into the awarding of a $97 million state contract to a Long Island
company owned by a major Republican political contributor,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are investigating whether the contracting
process was influenced by a total of $100,000 that donors linked to
the company, Silverite Construction, had given to the New York
Republican State Committee in the days just before and after the
company received the contract to repair the Queens Midtown Tunnel
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano's office declined to comment, but other Pataki aides
said that in the past week Gargano had received the subpoena to
testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn has declined to discuss
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano was the chief fund-raiser for the Pataki campaign in
1994, after which Pataki appointed him to oversee the state's
economic development agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Gargano has said he no longer raises money for the
Pataki campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Silverite's owner, Angelo Silveri, said in an interview last
March that he was a friend of Gargano and talked to him often.
Silveri said he might have spoken about the tunnel project with
Gargano.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gargano have said there could have been such a
discussion, but they said Gargano had no role in the project, which
is supervised by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The authority had originally determined that Silverite and its
partner in the venture lacked the experience for the four-year
project, one of the largest state contracts in recent years. But
Silverite then altered its application and got the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The authority and Silveri have both said that the donations had
nothing to do with the contract. But after The New York Times
disclosed the timing of the donations last March, federal
prosecutors began their investigation and the authority undertook
an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have already issued subpoenas to officials at
the transportation authority, Silveri and executives of the
companies that lost the bidding and contended that the process was
biased toward Silverite.
</P>
<P>
   Silveri has been one of the biggest financial backers of the
Pataki campaign and the Republican State Committee. He and donors
connected to him have given roughly $335,000 to the Republican
State Committee and the Pataki campaign since October 1994,
according to campaign finance records.

DEAL WITH ARIZONA KEEPS BOYS RANCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
 RANCH-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Boys Ranch reached a deal with state regulators to
remain open, but agreed to sweeping reforms that could end a
half-century of hard-nosed discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement announced Wednesday, the Department of
Economic Security reversed its decision to deny an operating
license to Boys Ranch, which agreed to major changes in management
and the treatment of teenage offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Blessing, director of DES, said she believes the compact
will eliminate a tradition of in-your-face confrontations and
hands-on discipline at the home for troubled boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a change in their operation. (Now) it's a matter
of carrying out that policy,'' Blessing added.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Boys Ranch directors committed to a ``zero
tolerance'' standard for abuse of troubled youths, and vowed
cooperation and compliance with state licensing laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the deal in hand, the future of Boys Ranch remains
uncertain. It lost four-fifths of its enrollment after the death of
a 16-year-old California youth, likely faces a lawsuit as a result
of that death and now appears to be giving up some of is trademark
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old non-profit corporation, with campuses statewide,
has been in jeopardy since Nicholaus Contreraz died March 2 while
being punished at a boot camp in Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities concluded that the Sacramento boy's severe lung
infection was misdiagnosed, and that he succumbed after days of
punishment and taunting by employees who thought he was faking
illness.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examiner found more than 70 cuts, scrapes and other
wounds on Contreraz's body.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Blessing issued a scathing report of misconduct at
Boys Ranch. She described a pattern of abuse and neglect in the
Contreraz case, and in 29 other instances reviewed by child welfare
specialists. She also noted that Boys Ranch had been uncooperative
during previous investigations that substantiated abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Pinal County grand jury indicted five former Boys
Ranch workers on manslaughter and child abuse charges in connection
with the Contreraz case.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing said the settlement does not affect the criminal
prosecutions or abuse cases still under investigation by Child
Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   But it does allow Boys Ranch to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the agreement requires Boys Ranch to create
an ombudsman to represent juveniles, redesign programs, recruit a
new president and cooperate with future DES oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Ranch has always been committed to providing quality
programs for troubled youth,'' said John DeWulf, the organization's
vice chairman. ``And we are anxious to embrace the terms of this
agreement in order to continue a rehabilitation program that is one
of the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the required changes have already occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Thomas, president and chief executive at Boys Ranch for 22
years, was relieved of his duties by the board of directors. Denice
Fitchie, another longtime administrator and second in command,
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists at CPS identified 17 employees responsible for
misconduct leading to Contreraz's death, while licensing officials
listed 29 additional charges involving other boys.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Contreraz case initiated those probes, settlement
papers and news releases issued by DES and Boys Ranch made no
mention of the boy or what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even think right now,'' said Contreraz's grandmother,
Connie Woodward of Sacramento, on learning of the DES decision. ``I
just hope that they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This place can't have changed that much that fast. It's like
throwing the garbage out and not cleaning out the garbage can.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessing said Wednesday that her objective was never to close
Boys Ranch, but to force a new attitude and administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that these systemic changes take
place _ cultural changes,'' Blessing said. ``New leadership was a
critical piece here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, at least three major investigations
have substantiated abuse at Boys Ranch. In each case, the
organization hired experts to dispute the findings, then complained
that charges were trumped up by biased state investigators and
lying kids.
</P>
<P>
   DES also negotiated settlements in some of those disputes, only
to have charges resurface.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing said there is a major difference this time because Boys
Ranch has agreed to provide DES monitors with unrestricted access
to records, staff and residents, and to set up a program that will
protect juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Although the settlement does not specifically discuss Boys
Ranch's method of putting recalcitrant juveniles against a wall and
``addressing'' them, Blessing said she intends to make sure such
tactics are eliminated via program reforms. In addition, she said,
hands-on discipline will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Casandra McCray, director of development for Boys Ranch, said
that the ``reality-based'' program has always banned child abuse,
but that the settlement offers an oppor tunity to emphasize
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we are going to remain a very structured program, a
very disciplined program,'' McCray added.
</P>
<P>
   The $26 million agency provides residential rehabilitation for
serious juvenile offenders who are placed by courts and probation
departments. Treatment methods include a shock-therapy orientation
program, confrontational discipline and community service, plus a
tough regimen of work and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Each youth represents $3,600 a month, covered in most cases by
tax dollars. Since Contreraz's death, however, enrollment has
plummeted from nearly 600 to fewer than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Only the main campus in Queen Creek is open. California, which
provided about three-quarters of the boys, withdrew its juveniles.
Most employees have been laid off. And negative publicity crippled
recruitment efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing said those problems may explain why Boys Ranch
officials had ``a sense of urgency to get back on track'' during
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, DES agrees to give ``reasonable assurances''
about Boys Ranch to courts and other juvenile placement agencies _
support that could help revive enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, chairman of the board at Boys Ranch, said his
agency is ``looking forward to a more positive relationship with
DES and the opportunity to serve more Arizona juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blessing said giving ``reasonable assurances'' means only
that DES will verify that Boys Ranch has lived up to the
settlement, not that her agency will make endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, Arizona enrollments at Boys Ranch have been
limited due to a series of conflicts between Thomas and the Arizona
Office of the Courts, which funds in-state placements.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 25 Arizona youths at Boys Ranch in March, but
only two are there now because court administrators banned further
placements after Contreraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   That position could change based on the settlement with DES,
according to John MacDonald, communications director at the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen lately from Boys Ranch is pretty
encouraging,'' MacDonald said. ``We'll see what the future
brings.''
</P>
<P>
   California officials are wary. Sidonie Squier, deputy director
of public affairs for the state's Department of Social Services,
said she was puzzled by terms of the settlement between Boys Ranch
and DES _ especially the ``zero tolerance'' agreement on abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always had to abide by that,'' she said. ``You had to
really mean it all along. . . . If Arizona Boys Ranch was in
California, that would not be enough to get them relicensed.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Contreraz case, Squier noted, the California
Assembly adopted a new law this year restricting the placement of
juveniles out of state. She said programs such as Boys Ranch must
now be certified by California inspectors, and must meet that
state's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like it would be unlikely we'd send juveniles
to that facility,'' Squier said. &QL;

 FRED KASSNER, 71, CO-FOUNDER OF LIBERTY TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred Kassner, the co-founder of Liberty Travel and a
pioneer in bringing many of the world's exotic vacation spots
within reach of people of modest means, died Oct. 6 at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 71 and lived in
Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, a Liberty official said.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 company-owned travel and cruise stores in the Northeast
and Florida, Liberty Travel is the biggest privately owned leisure
travel chain in the United States, serving more than 1 million
customers every year. Liberty Travel also owns Gogo Worldwide
Vacations, which markets vacation packages to independent retail
travel agencies from 88 sales offices in 31 states. Liberty and
Gogo, both based in Ramsey, N.J., have a total of 2,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But when 22-year-old Kassner and Gilbert Haroche, his New York
University classmate, opened their first Liberty Travel store in
Times Square in 1951, theirs was a one-desk, two-man operation
specializing in travel to the Catskills and Miami. Before long they
added the Caribbean and Mexico, and eventually included Hawaii and
many other destinations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The key to their success was making all-inclusive vacation
packages affordable for the general public, for which air travel
and resorts were usually out of reach. Today such packages _ which
often include transportation, hotels, meals and sightseeing, thus
making their combined elements more affordable than buying each
segment individually _ are widely sold by travel agencies,
airlines, cruise ships and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Kassner was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1927, the son of a bank
president. He attended boarding school in England and was 12 years
old when World War II broke out. At that point he joined his
parents, who had immigrated to New York. Kassner served in the Army
and later graduated from New York University with a degree in
accounting and banking. Over the years he owned and operated
steamship cruise lines, hotels, restaurants and golf and country
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Kassner is survived by his wife, Gerda; two daughters, Ellen
Teitelbaum of Fairlawn, N.J., and Michelle Kassner of New York
City; a sister, Trudy Carlyle of Long Island City, Queens; a
brother, Ernest, of Vallejo, Calif.; and three grandchildren.

GIANTS COME IN FROM COLD AMID TALK OF FALCONS SPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Dan Reeves isn't the New York Giants
coach anymore, but as he prepares to bring his Atlanta Falcons to
Giants Stadium this weekend, he's still having an impact on Giants
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants moved part of their practice indoors Wednesday to
keep it secret, and later had a Giants security official scanning
the high-rise buildings that overlook the team's outdoor practice
field with high-powered binoculars because they feared that friends
or associates of Reeves might be spying on the team's workouts this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, a team official said, had taken the precautions
because they had been told that Joe DeCamillis, an Atlanta
assistant coach who was also an assistant under Reeves with the
Giants, had planned to use his familiarity with the area and the
buildings surrounding the Giants practice fields to position
someone to spy on practices.
</P>
<P>
   It is routine, even expected, that National Football League
coaches will suspect that opposing teams are trying to steal their
game plans or individual plays. It's almost part of football lore
and the players hardly mind, since they have grown accustomed to
the stratagem. But Reeves' past ties to the Giants gave Wednesday's
tidbit added bite.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, Reeves, when he was Giants coach, often
used to remark _ with some annoyance _ how easy it might be for
someone to rent a room in the hotel and surreptitiously film or
scout Giants practice.
</P>
<P>
   DeCamillis, who is also Reeves' son-in-law, Wednesday denied he
had ever said anything about spying on the Giants this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't doing anything like that,'' DeCamillis said in a
telephone interview from the Falcons' offices. With a laugh, he
added, ``I wish I had time to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCamillis said: ``Coach Reeves would be angry if he knew
someone did that. I would never say something like that. I would
never do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel did not want to comment on why he
concealed the earliest part of Wednesday's workout _ a portion of
practice when new plays designed for the Falcons game are explained
to the team and implemented in slow detail on the field. Fassel
moved the players inside a facility next to the stadium that is
surrounded by an opaque plastic bubble.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants usually practice inside the bubble only when it rains
or snows.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel also declined to comment on why the Giants had
high-powered binoculars trained on the windows of two buildings, an
office building and a Sheraton hotel. The buildings are several
hundred yards away from the practice fields adjacent to Giants
Stadium, but rooms on one side of the buildings have a clear,
unobstructed view of the practice area.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel did tell members of the team Wednesday that he didn't
think he was paranoid for being so secretive. He considered it a
precaution, since someone with a trained football eye might be able
to learn something from watching the team's practices, which are
closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fassel moved the practices inside Giants Stadium where
there is more privacy before the Giants' division-clinching victory
over Washington last December. Fassel believes his secretiveness in
that case may have been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Giants players Wednesday were preparing to face Reeves in other
ways, acknowledging that their former coach has turned around the
once hapless Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some good players, and he's got them believing in
his system,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ``That happened
when Dan came here in 1993, too. It doesn't really surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Corey Widmer said he knew Reeves would land on his
feet wherever he went after his Giants tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't survive and thrive in pro football for 30-something
years as a player and coach without having a lot going for you,''
Widmer said. ``I have a lot of respect for Dan. He's played in
Super Bowls and coached in Super Bowls. I knew he'd be successful
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said Wednesday that he had addressed his team about what
effect Reeves' return to Giants Stadium might have on the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say anything in a derogatory way,'' Fassel said.
``I'm sure there are a lot of different feelings and I just talked
about how we handle that and how we deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel added: ``I don't think there is any question that Dan
will get his team fired up to come in here and play. I'm sure it
means a lot to him.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Safety SAM GARNES (foot) did not practice Wednesday. There
continues to be some difference of opinion over what the proper
course of treatment is for Garnes, who may need foot surgery if he
continues to play. The Giants have said that Garnes aggravated an
old stress fracture in his right foot, but the injury may be worse
than that.
</P>
<P>
   _ Center DEREK ENGLER (ankle), linebacker SCOTT GALYON
(Achilles' heel), defensive tackle ROBERT HARRIS (strained chest
muscle) and cornerback PHILLIPPI SPARKS (sore shoulder) also did
not practice, but they have been listed as probable. Galyon has
been out since the Giants' second game. &QL;

 HANK MORRIS: BEHIND SCHUMER ADS, `A LONG ISLAND THING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under the rules, Hank Morris is not allowed to say
that the Senate race here is the campaign of a lifetime, the
culmination of everything he has learned in politics, the potential
breakthrough moment that could cement his reputation as a giant
killer. Naturally, he does have other clients besides Charles
Schumer, and it would be amateurish to stake one's reputation on a
statistical dead heat, even if he is ahead by a few points.
</P>
<P>
   But under those same rules, no one has to believe him. In the
words of his friend and former partner Phil Friedman, another
Democratic media consultant, ``this race does mean everything'' to
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``To defeat Al D'Amato with a candidate brought essentially from
obscurity would be a professional triumph for Hank,'' Friedman
said. ``Very few victories would ever mean more. And it would be a
personal triumph as well, because it's a Long Island thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Island, in this case, pronounced as if it were the
Chinatown of the Roman Polanski movie, the den of sorrowful
complications and primal political hatreds that has spawned the
true passions behind the year's most virulent campaign. To see
Morris in his full competitive glory, to understand why his
advertisements for Schumer were constructed of such gleaming barbed
wire, just get him started on growing up at a Democratic dinner
table in Westbury on Long Island in the 1960s and '70s, in the
heart of the Nassau Republican machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be the idyllic suburban dream, but by the
time you got to when I was coming of age, in the '70s, the machine
had ruined it,'' said Morris, who is 45. ``There was rampant growth
and a gas station on every corner and property taxes were choking
people. You couldn't get a summer job if you were a Democrat _ they
had done a leveraged buyout of Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   The diatribe builds to its inevitable crescendo as Morris _
fully agitated now, his words moving fast _ finally places Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato at the controls of the machine, the apotheosis of
everything he went into politics to eradicate. He stops short of
saying it, but there is a great deal of the personal in this race,
beyond his long friendship with Schumer, beyond the money he is
making producing and placing the campaign ads, beyond the glory
that he would obtain if his ads, which are the campaign, defeat
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between me and most New Yorkers is that most
people have come to believe D'Amato's been there too long,'' he
said, ``while I believed he was in office too long before he ran
for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, in other words, has not moved into the first ranks of
political consultants by being a dutiful technician, tailoring his
ads to the whims of poll numbers. He has come to embody the New
York style of political consultant: the gut-instinct competitor,
spikes high, who comes to the game with plenty of ideology and a
willingness to spend some time in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when his client, Alan Hevesi, was waging his
come-from-behind campaign against Elizabeth Holtzman for city
comptroller, Morris was known to drop by Ms. Holtzman's news
conferences to stare her down and fluster her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, his firm created an ad for Dianne Feinstein's
gubernatorial race in California that became famous in political
circles for using footage from the moment Ms. Feinstein told the
world that the mayor of San Francisco had been assassinated. Though
his competitors blasted the ad as tasteless, it was enormously
effective and was credited with making her a statewide competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In the current race, Morris created the ads that call D'Amato a
liar, matching the senator's anti-Schumer ads point by negative
point. This has surprised no one who knows him, especially his
detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does too much negative,'' said David Garth, the legendary
New York consultant who used to be Morris' mentor but hasn't spoken
to him in the 16 years since he left Garth's firm. ``He can win
that way, but after a while American voters get tired of attack,
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who can't even agree with Garth on the origins of their
dispute, dismisses such talk, saying he is negative when necessary
but is perfectly capable of running positive campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It was the positive side of politics that first drew him into
that world, he says, recalling his high-school volunteer work for
Robert Kennedy and several local candidates. (His mother, who
taught at Nassau County Community College, shared his interest,
running an unsuccessful but colorful campaign for Congress in 1992.
He says his best advice for her was not to run.)
</P>
<P>
   A year working in the state Assembly in 1975 failed to horrify
him, and in fact taught him a great deal about the pitiless nature
of politics in his chosen neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of working for Garth, he went out on his own in
1981, armed with a suitably quirky trademark (sweaters every day of
the year) and his firm, now called Morris, Carrick &AMP; Guma, has
steadily flourished. He lives by himself on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan and spends almost every waking hour during a campaign on
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you do this, it seems like the most important thing
in the world,'' he said. ``But I guess this one is a little bit
special. Maybe the closest thing I've done to the Thrilla in
Manila.''

IT'S PARENTS VS. RETIREES IN SCHOOL BOND SLUGFEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARRISON, N.Y. _ The custodian barged into the main office at
the Garrison School, a look of alarm on his face. Two elderly men
and a woman were wandering the property, he told the
superintendent. Should he chase the trespassers away?
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Brannigan knew at once that the uninvited guests posed
no physical threat to the 298 elementary and middle school
children. They were opponents of a plan to enlarge the little stone
schoolhouse and had come to see the site and marshal new arguments
before an Oct. 20 referendum.
</P>
<P>
   This Putnam County hamlet is at odds over a school bond issue,
with prosperous young parents squared off against retirees
determined to hold the line on school taxes. It is a classic
suburban slugfest, like those playing out in one community or
another every day. Ho-hum, unless it's your children, your tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   One school board member got in a shoving match with 75-year-old
Bob Rogers, an amputee who has a wooden leg, carved from a baseball
bat. Rogers, confronted recently outside a community meeting, calls
the building plan extravagant, the new gymnasium ``a regular Taj
Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Rogers' allies, Betsy Calhoun, 61, stirred rage in a
quieter way. She distributed a list of teachers' salaries, arguing
that paying them up to $70,000 a year was exorbitant. She has also
questioned the need to teach two foreign languages. And what about
special education? Ms. Calhoun says that's a boondoggle.
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute that the school has outgrown its building,
built in 1908, expanded in the 1960s and since untouched. The
student population has been rising since the mid-1980s. But the
overcrowding has more to do with pedagogical changes, like resource
rooms for learning-disabled children and computer labs.
</P>
<P>
   To make room, classrooms have been cut in half, with some as
narrow as railroad cars, so students must turn sideways and slither
to the blackboard. Group projects are impossible in these cramped
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnasium is too small for home basketball games. It doubles
as an auditorium but cannot accommodate the whole student body for
a concert. There are no locker rooms so children change for gym in
a five-stall bathroom, leaving their clothes in heaps on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.9 million proposal would add six new classrooms and a
7,000-square-foot gymnasium with locker rooms; the old gym would be
converted into a library and technology center. According to its
proponents, taxes (currently the third lowest in a seven-county
region) would increase a maximum of $195 a year, most of that
offset by a school tax abatement program initiated by Gov. George
Pataki, who makes his home in Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time to build,'' said Deborah Friedman, mother of
a first grader, citing the abatement program, a one-time offer of
state aid for school construction and the lowest interest rates in
decades. A more modest referendum failed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plan, who seem a tiny but noisy minority, are
willing to go along with only the new classrooms. They offer
spartan solutions to the other problems, like using a gym in a
nearby monastery for sporting events and having students use the
public library for research projects.
</P>
<P>
   What about a locker room? ``I suggested putting a tent on the
stage,'' Ms. Calhoun said. ``But every suggestion I make is sneered
at. I'm trying to compromise with people who are really out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   While the battle is typical, it has one distinctive element.
Old-timers here recently took a huge financial hit because of a
long-overdue countywide reassessment of real estate. Rogers'
40-year-old ranch house, for instance, was reassessed at $225,000,
from $11,300. The retired electrician concedes the new assessment
is fair though hard to swallow on a fixed income.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brannigan, the superintendent, reminds elderly opponents of
an American verity: ``The senior citizens paid for you to go to
school. They paid for your children to go to school. Now it's your
turn.'' But she hasn't quieted their howls.
</P>
<P>
   That was left to Brian O'Donnell, editor of The Putnam County
News &AMP; Recorder. O'Donnell this week declined to print a letter
from Ms. Calhoun, saying that it was only fair that others be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   And after Wednesday's edition of the weekly, everyone will be
silenced. It is the paper's policy to close debate on a ballot
issue two weeks before the vote so tempers have time to cool.

EDITORIAL: CALIFORNIA'S TOBACCO INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 8:
</P>
<P>
   The demise of national tobacco control legislation puts the
burden on states to find new strategies to reduce smoking and its
harmful consequences. The California Children and Families
Initiative, which will be on the November ballot as Proposition 10,
provides a model that other states could emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 10 would raise the state cigarette tax by 50 cents
per pack, an increase that should cut smoking rates significantly,
particularly among teen-agers who are especially sensitive to
price. An added benefit is the estimated $700 million a year the
tax would generate to pay for new health, nutrition, education and
child-care programs for preschoolers. The total pot could reach
more than $1 billion if the state uses the new revenue as matching
funds to tap into federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to use a tobacco tax to pay for children's
programs because secondhand smoke and smoking during pregnancy have
been linked to low-birthweight babies, pre-term births and
increased asthma and respiratory infections among infants and
children. Simply reducing the number of parents who smoke would
improve children's health. The new money would help counties expand
children and family services, as well as pay for more anti-smoking
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, spearheaded by the film director Rob Reiner,
grew out of ideas presented at a White House conference on infant
development last year that focused on good parenting and health
care between birth and age 3, the critical period of brain growth.
The measure has drawn broad bipartisan support and is supported by
every major health and education association in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The primary opposition comes from the tobacco industry, which is
expected to spend more than $15 million trying to defeat the
measure. The industry is right to worry. If California voters
approve this measure, as recent polls indicate they will, this
initiative could well start a national movement.

GERMAN GROUP SUSPENDS PIPPIG AFTER SHE FAILS DRUG TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uta Pippig, the German runner who won the 1993 New York City
Marathon and three Boston Marathons, was suspended Wednesday by the
German track and field federation after failing a random
out-of-competition drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The German federation said that Pippig had tested above the 6:1
ratio of testosterone, the male sex hormone, to epitestosterone, a
related chemical. Anything above 6:1 is considered suspicious of
the use of testosterone as an anabolic steroid to build muscles and
to allow an athlete to recover quickly from strenuous workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The test was administered to Pippig on April 23 in Boulder,
Colo., where she lives and trains. A suspension is the first level
of punishment. If Pippig, 33, cannot convince authorities that the
suspicious urine sample was produced by something other than
performance-enhancing drugs, she faces a two-year ban from the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Pippig, who was in Germany on Wednesday, seemed to attack the
validity of the drug test on at least two fronts. Her coach and
partner, Dieter Hogen, told the German news agency SID that her
urine samples _ each test is divided into an A and a B sample _
were incorrectly labeled and that one contained a leak. He also
said that Pippig had experienced fluctuations in her hormonal
levels related to the taking of birth control pills.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Slaney used a similar argument about hormonal levels in
having her international suspension overturned by the U.S. track
and field federation after a suspicious test at the 1996 Olympic
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done nothing wrong,'' Pippig told the German news
agency. ``I have been tested 50 or 60 times and nothing has ever
been found. I can't admit to something that I haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo Rous, president of the German track federation, told
Reuters that there had been some mistakes with the test, but that
they had not compromised the results. According to German press
reports, authorities used carbon-isotope testing in analyzing
Pippig's drug sample, which is a new, advanced method of
determining the use of synthetic testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Pippig, who was born in Leipzig, in the former East Germany, has
not been a force in the marathon since she won her third Boston
Marathon in 1996 while suffering from dehydration and bleeding. She
dropped out of the 1996 Olympic marathon and finished fourth in
Boston in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she had been returning to form. On Sept. 8, she ran a
personal best of 15:03.72 in a 5,000-meter race in Berlin. She told
Runners World magazine in 1991 that she had briefly used banned
substances while competing for East Germany in the 1980s, but had
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 100 percent convinced she is innocent of any illegal
drug taking,'' Tom Ratcliffe, one of Pippig's agents, said in a
telephone interview from Boston. ``I know she has strong feelings
against drugs.''

EDITORIAL: THE URGENT AGENDA IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 8:
</P>
<P>
   With confusion and division growing over what to do about the
Serbian assault on the people of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
it is essential not to lose sight of the most urgent issue, which
is saving lives. Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians have been
driven from their homes in Kosovo by Serbian forces, and many will
soon perish in the cold forests if the Serbs do not withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Making it possible for the refugees to return home, and getting
international assistance to them, should be the overriding
objectives of Western diplomacy and potential military action.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Kosovo must recover the large measure of autonomy it
enjoyed before 1989, when Slobodan Milosevic came to power in
Serbia and began a violent crackdown on the Albanian majority in
Kosovo. But achieving that outcome is likely to take time and
negotiation, and should not impede help for the refugees as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   That help can be provided only if Milosevic pulls his murderous
forces out of Kosovo and keeps them out. Getting them off the
streets but leaving them in barracks in Kosovo where they can
resume the killing at any time is not good enough. Milosevic still
has time to remove them voluntarily, but so far he has defied
Western calls to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, has offered a generous deal
to Milosevic, asking him to withdraw his forces and to restore some
degree of autonomy while postponing for several years any
resolution of the ethnic Albanian demand for independence. Given
the Serbs' mistreatment of Kosovo, Milosevic does not deserve such
a restrained approach, but the use of force should be a last
resort. In this case, stability in the Balkans would ultimately be
best served by giving Kosovo great autonomy but not full
independence.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic rejects the U.S. plan, NATO warplanes and cruise
missiles should attack Serbian military targets in Kosovo and in
Serbia until he bends. Once Serbian forces are removed, and
threatened with further NATO attack if they return, the refugees
can begin heading home and international relief agencies can move
in to provide them with food and building materials.
</P>
<P>
   No NATO infantry or armored units should be sent into Kosovo to
evict the Serbs. That job should be done with air power. If some
kind of peacekeeping force is eventually needed to help assure the
safe resettlement of refugees, it ought to be drawn primarily from
European armies. Republican members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee are right to ask about these matters now, and Congress
must be consulted before any U.S. military action is taken.
</P>
<P>
   The political complexities of Kosovo and divisions in NATO about
the use of force may produce paralysis just when action is needed.
The governance of Kosovo cannot be set right before winter comes,
but thousands of refugees can be saved. When that work is done, the
United States and its European allies can help Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians regain the autonomy they should have.

MYRON SCOTT, 91, CREATOR OF SOAP BOX DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myron E. Scott, a photographer who had such an uneventful career
that he probably wouldn't have attracted much attention if there
hadn't been a couple of inspired blips in an otherwise satisfyingly
humdrum life, died Oct. 4 at his home in Kettering, Ohio. He was
91.
</P>
<P>
   Scott had left his marks on 20th-century culture as the man who
created the All-American Soap Box Derby and gave the Corvette
sports car its name. Considering his role in two of the nation's
most cherished innovations, Scott was a thoroughly unprepossessing
man.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Camden, Ohio, who grew up in Dayton, where his
father was a baker, he attended the Dayton Institute of Art before
going to work for The Dayton Daily News, first as a staff artist,
later as a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott might have spent his life contentedly taking pictures for
newspapers if it hadn't been for a chance assignment in June 1933.
Told to scour the area to get pictures of children at play, he was
driving through the little town of Oakwood when he became riveted
by the sight of a couple of boys coasting down Big Hill Road on
makeshift wooden contraptions mounted on baby buggy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, he asked the boys to round up some of their friends
and meet him in a few days for a race.
</P>
<P>
   When more than a dozen showed up, including one whose rig
reminded him of a soap box, Scott got not only the picture he
wanted, but also the idea that would change his life.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the promotional possibilities, Scott, who had apparently
thought up the name All-American Soap Box Derby while composing his
picture, persuaded his newspaper to sponsor a series of local races
during the summer of 1933 and to stage a race for boys from
different cities the next year. When more than 300 young
contestants and some 40,000 spectators showed up for the 1934 race
down Burkart Hill, Scott realized he was on to something big.
</P>
<P>
   Big enough, anyway, to attract the attention of the General
Motors Chevrolet division, which agreed to sponsor the race as an
annual event. Partly because Dayton residents had been annoyed by
the disruptions caused by the first race and partly because the
city of Akron, home to four large tire companies, lobbied for the
event, it was switched to Akron in 1935. With time out for World
War II, it has been a staple of summertime movie newsreels and
television coverage ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In getting Scott's race, Chevrolet also got Scott. Although he
returned to the newspaper as art director in 1937, he resumed his
work with Chevrolet two years later and stayed until his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the advertising department, Scott was asked to
attend a meeting one day late in 1952 to help pick out a name for
an ambitious European-style sports car Chevrolet was developing.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials had decided that the name should begin with a
C and should not be an animal name, but after sitting through the
meeting in which 300 names, including Champion, Celestial and
Challenger, were flashed on large cards and discussed, Chevrolet's
chief engineer, Edward Cole, said he didn't like any of them.
</P>
<P>
   That night, at home, Scott paged through the C's in his
dictionary until he came to the word ``corvette,'' the name of a
class of small, fast warships used as convoy escorts.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Scott sent a note to Cole asking, ``How would you
like to go for a ride today in my Corvette?''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Cole called Scott and asked, ``How would you like
to ride in MY Corvette?'' Scott's name, he was told, had been
chosen for the car.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who liked to point out that he got neither a bonus nor a
day off, let alone a Corvette, for coming up with its name, did get
his promised ride, however. He drove an early model of the first
true American sports car, complete with low-slung chassis, 20 miles
from Detroit to a suburban test facility.
</P>
<P>
   He was not impressed. As he explained years later, he didn't
like ``sitting on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   After Chevrolet ended its Derby sponsorship in 1972 and the race
was taken over by a nonprofit corporation, Scott remained a soap
box celebrity, one who could be a bit crotchety at times,
especially when he was criticizing the decision to allow girls in
the race for the first time in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But if Scott was a bit old-fashioned, so, of course, was his
very vision of an innocent, pre-television America, one in which
boys from 9 to 16 had the time, the skill, the inclination and the
reliable parental help needed to turn a soap box into a racer.
</P>
<P>
   Today's soap boxes tend to be sleek, kit-built plastic cars, but
Scott's image has not been entirely obliterated. After a time in
which it was replaced with a modern-looking car, Scott's drawing of
a 12-year-old at the wheel of an actual soap box coaster has been
restored to the Derby's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary this year, is
survived by his wife, Clara Jane.

VIRGINIA TECH LOOKS TO FORMER BACKUP AGAINST BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quarterbacks have long been a strength at Virginia Tech, but the
team's latest starter was reclaimed from the defense and pressed
into emergency duty Wednesday night against Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Sorensen was Virginia Tech's backup quarterback last year
but was moved to safety in the spring when Coach Frank Beamer and
his staff worried about the red-shirt sophomore's arm strength and
throwing motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't always look real pretty but he has a way of getting
the ball where it needs to be,'' said Beamer, whose Hokies are
trying to go 5-0 for the first time since 1967. Virginia Tech is
ranked No. 17 in The Associated Press poll and is No. 3 in The New
York Times computer ranking.
</P>
<P>
   From Don Strock to Jim Druckenmiller, who currently is a backup
for the 49ers, the Hokies always seem to have a classic dropback
passer with a bazooka arm. In fact, they started the year with one
in senior Al Clark, whose promising career has been repeatedly
tripped up by injuries. In 1995, he was scheduled for the starting
position but injured his knee in the spring, opening up the job for
Druckenmiller, whom he ended up backing up for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clark set the Big East single season record for
lowest percentage of interceptions and threw for 1,474 yards and 10
touchdowns. He got off to a quick start this year, leading the
Hokies to a 3-0 record with routs over Clemson and East Carolina
and an overtime victory over Miami. But he sprained his foot
against the Hurricanes, and Dave Meyer, a sophomore, started
against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But after staking the Hokies to a 17-7 lead, Meyer separated his
shoulder in the first series of the second half. So Sorensen, who
took a handful of snaps the week before the game, filled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know that I remembered all the plays until
they were called. They were in my head and they haven't left,''
said Sorensen, who completed 2 of 3 passes for 12 yards as the
Hokies won, 27-7.
</P>
<P>
   Clark will be available if necessary, but Beamer says he will
stay with Sorensen, who received most the snaps the past two weeks
as the Hokies returned after an off week. Virginia Tech has been
winning with a defense that has allowed just 66 yards rushing in
the past two games, but the Hokies will be tested by Boston
College's (3-1) Mike Cloud, who is the nation's fifth-leading
rusher with an average of 169 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offensive line is the biggest and most experienced in
the Big East and they're going to try and run the ball on us,''
said Pierson Prioleau, the Hokies' all-America candidate at
defensive back. ``That motivates us.''

FLORIDA COACH MUST MAKE CHOICE ON QUARTERBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier has quarterback problems of his own
making. He has decided that alternating them isn't for him after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he reasoned that when having two equally talented
quarterbacks like Doug Johnson and Jess Palmer means it is
necessary to play both. But after the No. 6 Gators (No. 21 in the
Times ranking) squeaked by Alabama, 16-10, Spurrier changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said he will now choose between the pair sometime
before Saturday's game against No. 11 Louisiana State University
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, the quarterback has to be the leader,'' he said.
``You have to look to someone out there and usually it's the guy
calling the plays, especially if you're going to throw the ball 40
times a game like we do. We're going to give the quarterback a
chance to lead our team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a tough call. Johnson, who sat out most of the
first two games while recovering from shoulder surgery, has
completed 56 percent of his passes and tossed five touchdowns.
Palmer has thrown the ball 42 more times at a 60 percent clip and
13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jess probably thinks he's the better guy and I
probably think I'm the better guy. That's how any athlete is,''
Johnson said. ``I want the job, he wants the job. It's up to Coach
Spurrier.''

EDITORIAL: BALLOT BATTLE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 8:
</P>
<P>
   So here we are again, edging toward Election Day with no firm
idea of what the ballots in New York City will look like. In
particular, the referendum section, often tucked down at the
lumbago level of the ballot, is still very much in doubt. The cause
for this confusion is a highly vocal and political battle between
Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who is running for governor, wants an item on the
ballot that asks voters whether public funds can be used to move
Yankee Stadium from the Bronx to Manhattan. The mayor, objecting
mightily to such a limitation on his powers, quickly established a
contrived Charter Revision Commission to find its own referendum
that would automatically bounce Vallone's off the ballot. So
Vallone and his City Council went to court _ in the Bronx, of
course _ and got a hometown judge to rule for the Vallone
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon, who describes Yankee
Stadium as ``the tabernacle of sport,'' ruled that the mayor's
commission did not make a comprehensive review of the charter
before devising its ``slapdash'' referendum on campaign reform. The
mayor retorted that ``when you present a political question to a
judge who is the product of the Democratic machine, you get a
Democratic answer, not an honest answer to the question.'' The city
immediately appealed, and was granted a stay.
</P>
<P>
   The best outcome would be if a higher legal authority found a
way to keep both referendums off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Vallone effort could harden the negotiating process on
Yankee Stadium and complicate the task of keeping the team in New
York City. The mayor's referendum is, in many ways, even worse. The
mayor used a legitimate process for revising the city's
constitution as a crude political tool. His referendum threatens to
disrupt one of the best campaign finance systems in the country.
These two referendums may be clever political gamesmanship, but
they are a disservice to New York City voters.

3 YOUTHS ARE SENTENCED IN KILLING OF MILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Two of the young men who pleaded guilty in the
kidnapping and murder of Nelson Gross, a New Jersey millionaire,
were given the maximum sentence of 30 years in prison Wednesday. A
third accomplice, who entered into a plea agreement to testify had
there been a trial, was sentenced to 17 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour session in a packed federal courtroom had strains
of eloquent anger, muted contrition and sobs of shame. The family
of Gross as well as the relatives of the defendants watched as U.S.
District Court Judge Alfred Wolin repeatedly rejected the pleas for
leniency by defense lawyers for two of the young men who were 17
years old at the time of the crime. In spite of their age, Wolin
said, their crime last year was ``a truly senseless thing'' and
their behavior was ``cruel and heinous'' as they repeatedly stabbed
Gross and left his body in an overgrown ravine on the Manhattan
shore of the Hudson River after extorting $20,000 from him.
</P>
<P>
   And, in part because of the brutality of the crime and the
seeming failure of two defendants to take full responsibility,
Wolin accepted the recommendation of U.S. Faith Hochberg that the
two men be sentenced to serve their terms at maximum security
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day will be spent in a tough, hard jail that is
unrelenting in how it handles prisoners,'' said Ms. Hochberg after
the sentencing, saying that she had recommended the federal maximum
security prisons in Marion, Ill., and Leavenworth, Kan. ``These
defendants are now put away, and we will not see or hear from them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no parole under federal law, although it is possible to
get some time off for good behavior. All of the defendants are
expected to serve virtually their entire sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows murder charges only in cases where the victim
was a federal employee. So Wednesday's sentencing followed guilty
pleas last February by Christian Velez, 18, Miguel Grullon, 18, and
Tony Estevez, 20, to federal charges of conspiracy to kidnap and
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to prosecutors, a kidnapping that ends in a
murder carries the same penalty as federal murder charges _ life in
prison _ under the sentencing guidelines used in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Those same guidelines, however, require that courts lower the
penalty if the defendants admit guilt and do it in a ``timely
fashion'' that allows the government to avoid a trial. And the
youthful defendants had also waived any challenge to the
government's decision to treat them as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the anger in the courtroom Wednesday came from the way
the defendants were charged. Michael Gross, the victim's brother,
talked bitterly of the kidnapping charges when murder was the
ultimate outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt, graying and walking with the aid of a cane, Michael Gross
addressed the court and called the charges ``a nicety,'' but said
they hardly obscured the fact that a husband, father and brother
had been murdered. He also questioned the guilty pleas of the
defendants, saying that he doubted they had actually had the
``experience of guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they been capable of that,'' he said, ``they would not
have been able to kill him because their own consciences would have
stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrition in the courtroom came from the defendants
themselves, each of whom rose to speak and apologize for his crimes
to Gross' family. Velez, speaking softly and stiffly in Spanish to
an interpreter, read from something he said he had written. ``I
want to beg Mr. Gross' family for their forgiveness,'' he said.
Grullon, dressed in a gray suit and a black, open-collared shirt,
also read stiffly, but in English, from a statement also asking for
forgiveness from the Gross family.
</P>
<P>
   Only Estevez, in a plaid sports shirt and baggy khaki pants,
spoke extemporaneously. In a long, rambling statement he apologized
for what had happened. ``I wish I could have done what I want to do
now _ go back and stop it all,'' he said. Wolin, in sentencing
Estevez, noted that not only had he agreed to testify against his
accomplices but had also opposed the last-minute decision of Velez
and Grullon to murder Gross, and left the scene without
participating.
</P>
<P>
   Gross was kidnapped at gunpoint Sept. 17, 1997, from the
Binghamton Restaurant on the banks of the Hudson River in
Edgewater, N.J. Velez, a former employee at the restaurant,
introduced the plan to his accomplices. The three, using an
unloaded gun, took Gross to a nearby bank and forced him to
withdraw $20,000. They then drove him to Manhattan where Velez and
Grullon decided to kill him for fear that he would identify them.
He was stabbed and hit with rocks, and his body was left in the
woods along the Hudson, within view of his restaurant.

PASTOR TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ Ed Pastor, Arizona's lone Democratic House member,
will vote Thursday to open a limited impeachment inquiry against
his party's president. The vote has the blessings of the House
Democratic leadership.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pastor's move, announced in a press release Wednesday, is part
of what is being viewed as a Demo cratic strategy to limit the
inevita ble. Faced with the fact Republi cans have enough votes to
pass an impeach ment inquiry to day, some Democrats pressed the
White House Wednesday to drop its opposi tion to an open-ended
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Democratic leaders are encouraging members to back a
more limited investigation, one that would be confined to
allegations contained in special counsel Ken neth Starr's report on
President Clinton's association with former White House intern
Monica Lewin sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the majority of my col leagues, I feel that the inquiry
must continue in order to bring true finality to this situation,''
Pastor said. ``Only by limiting the inquiry in scope and time can
we as a nation move beyond this issue and onto the important
business of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor's seat is considered rela tively safe. &QL;

COACHES FLAUNT DOUBLE STANDARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whenever a college football player breaks a team
rule or does something inappropriate, his coach stands piously in
front of the microphone and demands an apology, extracting promises
of reform before bringing the player back to the team.
</P>
<P>
   But there's rarely a time when a coach receives similar
scrutiny, unless he flagrantly violates NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week two coaches lost their cool _ with absolutely
no repercussions. And it shows why coaches feel they rule their
fiefdoms with absolute power.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Butch Davis unleashed an overhand right into a
blackboard during an expletive-laced halftime tirade at last week's
Rutgers game, which Miami won 53-17. The blackboard sported the
tell-tale sign of confrontation after the game _ a fist-sized hole
in its upper left-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Davis just got caught up in the heat of the moment. But
listen to the Miami players' response to the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of scared me,'' senior defensive tackle Michael Lawson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really showed us the other side of him,'' added receiver
Santana Moss, who had three touchdown receptions.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for Davis to lecture his players about
decorum and dignity after failing to display those qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have Ohio State, which seems to come up with some form
of anti-social behavior on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback coach Tim Salem needed six stitches to close a cut
on his right wrist and two more on his right middle finger after
punching his hand through a quarter-inch plate glass window in the
press box when the Buckeyes scored a second-quarter touchdown
against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pure reaction,'' Salem said. ``It was a big-time
game. It's college football. How could you not get excited?''
</P>
<P>
   Excited is one thing; out of control is another.
</P>
<P>
   Shards of glass hit eight people sitting below the coaches box.
One woman had to have a sliver of glass removed from her foot. Two
people found glass in their hair and inside their clothes. Six
others had to be moved from their seats for the second half as a
precaution because Ohio State officials feared the window might
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Salem's response?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you're asking me?'' he said. ``I'm going to start
off by saying that for every person who asks me about this
glass-punching incident, I'm going to make sure the next three
games you're sitting in front of our damn booth, so if you've got a
question, just be prepared to sit in front of us for the next three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you spend as much time as we do and you get into a
game like that, there was a lot of enthusiasm and (I was) pumped up
because we had scored a touchdown. That's what I think college
football is all about. I guess if I had to do it every Saturday to
keep winning games, I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fall from grace: How far have Clemson and North Carolina fallen?
Just look at some numbers for their game on Saturday. Through three
quarters, Clemson had completed just one pass for 12 yards. The
team ran 36 times for 87 yards and was winning 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   But North Carolina, the erstwhile Tailback U., rushed for 45
yards _ and won. The Tar Heels will take the 21-14 victory,
however. It was their first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clemson has lost four in a row for the first time
since 1975, and coach Tommy West's job security is in question.
</P>
<P>
   Number switch: Chalk up another (unofficial) record for Ricky
Williams _ most uniform numbers in a career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams received the OK this week to wear No.37 to honor Doak
Walker when the Longhorns play Oklahoma on Saturday in the Cotton
Bowl. Williams, who wore No.11 his first three seasons, will return
to wearing No.34 after the game with the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be great,'' Williams said. ``I'm wearing it
because we're playing in the Cotton Bowl. I thought it would be
neat to wear (No.) 37 in the house that Doak built. I'm playing
with him in my heart. It's a special thing that I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials had to clear the number change with the NCAA,
the Big 12 Conference and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make sure everyone knows about it so nobody would
think we're trying to trick anyone,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams became friends with Walker, the former SMU Heisman
Trophy winner, last winter when Williams won the running back award
named for Walker. When Walker died Sept. 27, Williams said he was
dedicating the rest of his season to Walker's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the commish? The WAC's departing eight schools are
expected to make some major decisions within the next three weeks,
beginning with calling themselves the Mountain West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing weeks, the transition teams will choose a
commissioner from among these finalists: former UNLV assistant
athletic director and Orange Bowl committee member Keith Tribble;
Big Ten assistant commissioner Kevin Weiberg; Sun Belt commissioner
Craig Thompson; Wright Waters, a marketing director at Alabama, and
former Cal athletic director Dave Maggard, a member of the NHL's
expansion franchise in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 is expected to announce its new commissioner this
week; an announcement could come today or Friday. The candidates
are: Ohio Valley commissioner Dan Beebe, Conference-USA commish
Mike Slive, Sun Belt commish Craig Thompson and Big Ten deputy
commish Kevin Wieberg. &QL;

THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS  
 BRUINS' VISIT IS INCENTIVE FOR UA STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toss a compliment at Chris McAlister and he'll knock it down as
if it were just another pass attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Through Arizona's first four victories, the post-game scene near
McAlister's corner of the locker room began to take on a routine.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and teammates would marvel at McAlister's unfailing
ability to exceed expectations. McAlister would say he has yet to
achieve anything.
</P>
<P>
   He has his own standards. Some would say they are impossible.
But Wildcats Coach Dick Tomey admires McAlister's self-imposed
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sign of a player who is always working to
improve,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the product of a player, a person, who has battled
and lost. Despite his evident talent and preseason credentials as
an All-America cornerback, things have not always been easy for
McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   The latest obstacle came last Saturday. He was declared
ineligible for Arizona's thrilling 31-28 victory at Washington
because of a loan from a bank in Austin. The NCAA ruled that his
potential earning power as a pro allowed him to get $14,000 above
the $10,800 premium for an approved disability insurance policy.
Arizona has aggressively defended him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sickens me,'' said Tomey, who said McAlister acquired
the loan from a Texas bank at 14.9 percent interest, hardly a
special privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, No. 10 in the Associated Press poll and No. 11 in the
USA Today/ESPN version, has taken its own steps to protect
McAlister. Tomey asked the media not to interview him about the
one-game suspension. And McAlister isn't commenting. He's getting
ready for another battle: third-ranked UCLA on Saturday night at
Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins always have been something of a war cry for
McAlister, who, despite his absence at Washington, still is
considered a contender for the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's
best defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   His boyhood dream of playing for UCLA was destroyed by a messy,
complicated controversy about SAT scores. The Bruins challenged his
score on a test taken in 1995. The length of the process forced him
to spend one year in junior college. His family sued the Education
Testing Service, which investigated the challenge. The lawsuit was
eventually dropped. By then, McAlister was at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He had grown up in a UCLA family and not far from the Bruins'
bench. He was a quarterback at Pasadena High School, just around
the corner from the Rose Bowl, the Bruins' home field. His father,
James McAlister, was an All-America running back for the 1973
Bruins and one of the few high school athletes to ever appear on
the cover of ``Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   He can remember great UCLA players dropping by the house. He met
Troy Aikman, Gaston Green and J.J. Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaston Green, he was No. 1,'' said McAlister, who in 1996
tasted a little revenge with a a 100-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins powder blue once filled his wardrobe. Today, the color is
just another source of motivation for a young man who always seems
to be pushing himself to prove a point.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant at UCLA, Tomey coached McAlister's father, who
today is a special education teacher and track coach at Pasadena
High.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris' dad and I are friends,'' Tomey said. ``James was a very
good football player. But Chris is unique. There are not too many
defensive backs with his size (6 feet 1, 195 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just special.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend provided another example of that. McAlister didn't
accompany the team to Seattle because of the suspension. But he was
at the Tucson airport to greet his teammates when their charter
landed about 4 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of athletes in that situation would not have come out to
the airport that early in the morning,'' Tomey said. ``They would
have been off somewhere, feeling sorry for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister's teammates noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just great to see him there,'' said defensive lineman
Eli Wnek, a redshirt freshman from Glendale. ``Chris is more than
just a great player on this team. He's our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, Wnek explained, McAlister's presence at the
airport was a symbol that he's always going to be there. At the
airport. Or on the field.
</P>
<P>
   This Saturday, the attention shifts to his role on the field
against Bruins quarterback Cade McNown, a Heisman Trophy contender.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the NCAA allowed McAlister to choose which game to
serve his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA never was an option. &QL;

THERE'S COACHING, AND NOTRE DAME 
</HEADLINE>
 DAME-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ara Parseghian achieved Messianic status during his first season
at Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish returned to gridiron glory in
1964, rolling up six, seven, eight wins in a row.
</P>
<P>
   During a late-November game, an unexpected winter storm swept
across Lake Michigan, dumping a heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame student body had come to believe their new coach
could do anything. Ask and ye shall receive. So, as the weather
worsened, the huddled students began to chant. ``Ara, stop the
snow! Ara, stop the snow!''
</P>
<P>
   New on the job, Parseghian knew little about protocol at the
school. So as the fans chanted, he turned to an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, what is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ara rolled his eyes toward the gray sky. ``Well,'' he asked
timidly, ``could I?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, same thing happened. During a Notre Dame home
game, a winter storm blew in, covering the stadium in a blanket of
white. Again, the student section called upon its coach whose teams
from 1964-74 finished in the Top 10 nine times. ``Ara, stop the
snow!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The coach looked at an assistant, then playfully turned his eyes
to the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he asked, ``should I?''
</P>
<P>
   If you win, Notre Dame is the best coaching job in the country.
The school has it all. Spirit. Legend. Glorious tradition. A
nationwide following.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame is the Four Horsemen. Rockne. The Gipper. Notre Dame
is Angelo Bertelli, Johnny Lujack, Leon Hart, Paul Hornung. Joe
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   But along with prestige is the pressure, the demand to win. The
three toughest jobs in the world are president of the United
States, the mayor of New York City and the football coach at Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame. The school's fight song says
Notre Dame will win over all ``what though the odds be great or
small.'' The lyrics say nothing about settling for a tie, or losing
to Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Parseghian tells about the time he checked into a hospital for a
few days of rest at the end of his last season as the Irish coach.
Notre Dame had just lost to USC, 55-24.
</P>
<P>
   While recuperating, Ara expected some communication from the
school's athletic board, which was meeting behind closed doors to
discuss his successor. As Parseghian tells it, the following
telegram arrived at the hospital:
</P>
<P>
   `` Dear Coach'':``''
</P>
<P>
   `` The Athletic Board of the University of Notre Dame wishes you
a very speedy recovery, by a vote'' ``margin of four to
three''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Devine, Parseghian's successor, loved his six years at Notre
Dame. The man who had coached at ASU in the mid-1950s worked
tirelessly. Sometimes, late in the evening, alone in his office,
Devine says he almost could feel the presence of Knute Rockne
making the rounds, like a night watchman, his ghostly footfalls
echoing faintly through the corridors of the old stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Devine's Notre Dame teams won three bowl games and the national
championship in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to win is probably not much different from what
Bruce Snyder feels,'' Devine said of the ASU coach, whose Sun
Devils play the Irish on Saturday. ``For coaches, most pressure is
self-induced.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last season, Devine took the Fighting Irish to Tucson to
play Arizona. Two minutes before halftime in a close game, the
coach called a play that for him was out of character. His team
deep in its own territory, facing fourth and 5, Devine twirled his
whistle from the sideline, a secret signal for his 18-year-old
quarterback/punter to fake the punt.
</P>
<P>
   Devine's assistant coaches were shocked. So were the Wildcats.
Devine still can see Blair Kiel sprinting down the sideline, ball
tucked under his arm _ 80 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Great call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it worked,'' Devine said of the key play in the 20-3
victory. The old coach chuckled at his own daring. ``If it hadn't,
I'd still be at Notre Dame, hanging from a cross.'' &QL;

RUEGAMER CRITICIZED BY USC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A play involving Arizona State center Grey Ruegamer will be
reviewed by the Pac-10 this week at the request of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans want a rules interpretation of a play that resulted
in USC defensive tackle Marc Matock breaking his ankle Saturday at
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was an aggressive play. It was questionable,'' USC
assistant coach Ed Orgeron told the Los Angeles Daily News. ``There
are a lot of plays that are questionable. We'll probably mention it
because it was questionable. We just want to find out the ruling on
it. I wish it wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Matock told reporters he was unhappy about the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ruegamer) came back and dove toward my ankle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything illegal,'' Ruegamer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder, who has watched the play on film,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Schools file a report to the Pac-10 after games and questionable
plays on both sides are typically submitted. Game films are
reviewed by the conference's coordinator of football officiating,
Verle Sorgen.
</P>
<P>
   Matock is expected to be sidelined at least two months after
undergoing surgery that included having a metal plate inserted in
his ankle with six screws. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Around the Pac &QL; 
 &QL; 
From the department of good news, bad news:
</P>
<P>
   Washington quarterback Brock Huard will be sidelined two weeks
because of a partially separated shoulder, but at least his timing
is good.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have Utah State, California and Oregon State coming
up on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Huard suffered the injury late in the first half Saturday
against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Times are getting tough for Washington State, which has the
chance to accomplish this feat: first to worst.
</P>
<P>
   The defending league champion Cougars, who have lost eight
defensive linemen since the summer due to injuries, academic
ineligibility or transfer, found out they'll be without star
receiver Nian Taylor for two weeks because of a pulled muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State ranks ninth in the league in scoring offense
and eighth in scoring defense. It has committed 19 turnovers, a
Pac-10 high.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Coach Jim Lambright kept reporters out of his locker
room after the Huskies' 31-28 loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is hurting, and I will not allow them to be
interviewed to protect them from the stupidity of what went on out
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1991, two Pac-10 teams ranked in the
Top 10 will square off when No. 3 UCLA and No. 10 Arizona meet
Saturday night in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The previous big conference confrontation was when No. 3
Washington knocked off No. 7 California, 24-17. The Huskies went on
to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   USC has blocked five kicks in five games. Special teams have
accounted for four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA quarterback and Heisman hopeful Cade McNown isn't putting
up the numbers he did last season.
</P>
<P>
   His efficiency rating is 150.2, 16th-best in the nation. He led
the country last year with a 168.6 mark. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quote of the week &QL; 
 &QL; 
``They're nothing compared to the team they had last year. They
probably think they're good because they just won. 49-17. I might
think I'm pretty good if I just won, 49-17, but they're not that
good.'' _ Washington State receiver Taylor after Saturday's loss to
UCLA. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's hot &QL; 
 &QL; 
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats won over some skeptics Saturday with a 31-28
victory over Washington in that hostile environment known as Husky
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They lead the conference in scoring defense and rank third in
total offense. If they can pull out a win against the Bruins on
Saturday, they soon could be 8-0 because Oregon State and Northeast
Louisiana are next up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's not &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   How can we put this? Stanford stinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal has given up 1,136 yards and 98 points in the past
two weeks. It ranks last in the Pac-10 in scoring defense, rushing
defense, pass defense and total defense.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the defense has done its job. &QL;

Ms. Slaughter, from Rochester, N.Y., finds herself deeply torn. As

architecture.'' The ``cathedrals'' touted by Wynn _ a pontiff of
the material world _ are Disneyland, the Mall of America and his
own casino extravaganza, Bellagio, due to open next week in Las
Vegas, Nev. All three are landmarks of the trend for fusing
architecture, commerce and fantasy, of which Jerde is a pioneer. By

   TOY-BALLS (Undated) _ With a Super Bowl victory to his credit at
last, pro quarterback John Elway holds another record, widely
publicized by the OddzOn toy company. He has thrown the finned
Koosh Vortex Mach 110 more than 110 yards. OddzOn began as the
maker of the Koosh ball. Today, as part of toy giant Hasbro, it
belongs to the same family as its distant rival Nerf. Together,
Koosh and Nerf are building better balls - and the guns to fire
them. Both Nerf, the ball of one generation, and Koosh, that of the
next, quickly evolved into other products - hoops for backboards
and bedroom-closet doors, for instance. By Phil Patton.

   PARIS-PHONE-KIOSKS (Paris) _ Blues in the night. A purple heart
for the lovelorn. Peter Eisenman's new design for a Parisian
telephone kiosk is oddly poignant, coming from an architect noted
for such cold-blooded formal explorations as the Wexner Center for
the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, and that city's convention center, with
its metal roof that undulates like a bed of snakes. Commissioned by
J.C. Decaux, the French firm best known for deluxe sidewalk pay
toilets, the kiosk is one of several prototypes being considered
for placement throughout the city. Designs are also being submitted
by Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel, Charles Gwathmey, Robert A.M. Stern,
James Stewart Polshek, and Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. Decaux
plans to eventually distribute 5,000 of the kiosks, perhaps in a
mix of designs. By Herbert Muschamp.

   PARIS-CHEAP-FURNITURE (Paris) _ I arrived in Paris with two
suitcases and soon learned how to live among other people's things,
in a rented room decorated with Japanese white paper lanterns and
nondescript plasterboard shelves. By the time I graduated to my own
studio, I had the requisite bed, desk and couch from Ikea, but I
needed everything else. Determined to fill the apartment with
Parisian treasures, I ruled out the notoriously overpriced Left
Bank antique stores and Parisian flea markets like the Marche aux
Puces at Porte de Clignancourt. Instead, I began at the flea
market's poorer cousins, the brocantes, which are less publicized
roving antiques fairs. Like Parisians, most brocantes head south
for the summer, but they are back in full flower for the rentree in
the fall. By Kristin Hohenadel.

ASU SET TO HONOR WULK  
 ARENA FLOOR TO BEAR EX-COACH'S NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  STATE-WULK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ned Wulk will be honored by the university that fired him more
than 16 years ago, just short of a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   The floor at the Wells Fargo Arena (formerly the University
Activity Center) will be named Ned Wulk Court after the man who won
more games by far than any other Arizona State basketball coach.
The official announcement is today.
</P>
<P>
   Wulk will be feted at a banquet March 5, and the court will be
dedicated during halftime of the Southern California-ASU game the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Wulk coached the Sun Devils for 25 years, from 1957-58 until his
controversial firing after the 1981-82 season. He had a 406-272
career record at ASU. Including his record at Xavier (Ohio), Wulk
was five victories short of 500 when he was let go.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wulk, ASU competed in the Border, Western Athletic and
Pac-10 conferences, winning eight league titles and advancing to
the NCAA Tournament eight times. Because of the program's success,
the Activity Center was built and opened in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Before his dismissal, Wulk coached two of his best teams ever.
During the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons, the Sun Devils went a
combined 46-11 (31-5 Pac-10), finishing second in the conference to
Oregon State both times. At the end of the 1980-81 season, ASU beat
the then-unbeaten and No. 1-ranked Beavers by 20 points in
Corvallis.
</P>
<P>
   But ASU made early exits from the NCAA Tournament both years,
and that, combined with internal strife on his coaching staff and
the Sun Devils' 13-14 mark in 1981-82, hastened his exit.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's NCAA appearance in 1981 was the last until Bill Frieder's
Sun Devils made the 64-team field 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   After his contract was not renewed, Wulk remained part of the
ASU faculty and has been a constant presence at Sun Devils games,
witnessing an array of successors. New Coach Rob Evans, the
honorary chairman of the Ned Wulk Court Committee, is the fourth
full-time head coach to follow Wulk. ASU also has had two interim
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a guy who's done more for the Arizona
State basketball program than Ned Wulk,'' said athletic development
officer Jim Phillips, an assistant under Frieder and a member of
the committee. ``He's a legend. His accomplishments are
unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who played for Wulk include Joe Caldwell, Art Becker, the
late Tony Cerkvenik, Lionel Hollins, Kurt Nimphius, Alton Lister,
Lafayette Lever and Byron Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Lever and Becker are co-chairmen of the committee. &QL;

SEAHAWKS' CHANCES SLIM WITHOUT WARREN MOON ON FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jon Kitna is too green and John Friesz admits he came
as close as he ever has to throwing a pass backwards in last
Sunday's Arrowhead Rain Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the sight of Warren Moon walking gingerly after
practice Wednesday was so disconcerting to the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Moon is sore. He cannot rotate his upper body because of the
cracked rib he suffered against the Chiefs, which means he cannot
easily throw, which means that keeping up with the undefeated
Denver Broncos this Sunday is looking like a longer shot than the
3-2 Seahawks might like.
</P>
<P>
   One positive is that Moon has always healed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of game you wait on, that you want to play,''
Moon said. ``You're playing the best team in the league. This is
the way you measure how good you are, and this team counts on me
for these type of games.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about the Seahawks' splendid depth at
quarterback, the reality is that for a game as important as the one
this week, there is Warren Moon, and then there is a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early for a must-win,'' Moon said. ``But this is a
big game. This is a game we need to win. This is a game we need to
win to get some confidence and feel better about ourselves and to
get ourselves back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moon and the Seahawks' sputtering offense, this is the week
in which a statement could be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers' defense muffled any noise Moon and the offense
could have made at Three Rivers. The monsoon and the Chiefs made
the offense moot in Kansas City. Now, the Broncos are coming to the
Kingdome posing problems that only the veteran Moon can solve.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way: Whether it's Bubby Brister or John Elway
at quarterback for the Broncos, the Seahawks likely will find
themselves playing catch-up with Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Seahawk defense is tough. Yes, the Broncos have not
really beaten anybody (OK, the Patriots are a somebody). But the
Broncos have shown an uncanny ability to make the first quarter
their personal playground, outscoring their opponents 73-7.
</P>
<P>
   If the Broncos hold true to form, the Seahawks will have to
revert to their old three-wide passing days of yesteryear (1997)
and the ability of the quarterback to put the ball in the air will
become vital again, especially since running back Ricky Watters is
hurting with a deep thigh bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, coach Dennis Erickson sounded optimistic about the
return of his starting quarterback. Moon was not as convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Moon is able to start, the Seahawks have to be concerned
about whether he can finish. The Broncos will no doubt look for a
way to ram a helmet under Moon's flak jacket.
</P>
<P>
   If Moon can't go, or can't finish, Erickson said Wednesday he
will go with Friesz _ a move that anyone who watched Friesz against
the Chiefs Sunday, or against the Ravens last season, will wonder
about.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a howling sound coming from sports talk radio this
week, it is the Seahawk fan base yammering about how Friesz looks
all but washed up in the ninth season of his oft-injured,
never-quite-convincing NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Friesz did orchestrate the greatest come-from-behind victory in
franchise history. That 1995 game was the last time the Hawks beat
the Broncos. But lately, between the injuries and the
tentativeness, Friesz seems to be embracing too tightly his better
qualities, which are to be conservative and stay within himself.
</P>
<P>
   Should he start against the Broncos, a fast start will require a
flash of adrenaline from Friesz, not to mention him getting a good
handle on the football.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kitna has been relegated to the scout team this fall,
getting few snaps. That is in contrast to this past summer, when
Moon was holding out and Kitna seemed poised to emerge as the
winner in the competition with Friesz.
</P>
<P>
   With his energy, arm and legs, Kitna demonstrated that the Hawks
should put their quarterbacking faith in him, should it become
necessary to start someone other than Moon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That bubble burst in the final exhibition game, when Kitna threw
an interception against the 49ers, one that just floated out there
for cornerback Marquez Pope _ a miscue so glaring that the Seahawks
could no longer trust him to be their starter.
</P>
<P>
   Not much was different last Sunday in the Hawks' Bellyflop in
the Slop. Kitna threw an interception in the fourth quarter. Then
he made the ill-advised decision to run on fourth-and-15 when the
Seahawks were down to their final possession. He came up short,
which made you think about one thing with the Broncos looming:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should want Moon to be good to go. This is his season
to make a stand and the time is right, even if the rib is not.
</P>
<P>
   Moon vs. Elway. It is the matchup everybody wants. You. Me.
Erickson. Moon. TV. NFL Films. Even the backups who wouldn't mind
starting would have to agree that things will be better if Moon
makes a speedy recovery.

PLAYERS PESSIMISTIC ABOUT NBA LABOR TALKS TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA owners and players are scheduled to sit down today for their
first formal negotiations since Aug. 6, and if substantial progress
isn't made, the scheduled Nov. 3 start of the regular season is in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to sit there and talk all day and all night and
maybe someone will come up with something,'' NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Often that's how it happens, but I
have no reason to be optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The seats may not be warm for long at this negotiating session,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if it lasted an hour,'' said one player, who
asked that he not be identified. ``They (the owners) don't won't to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the typical union reaction after it received a new set
of proposals from ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they send us a proposal (like) they sent us last time,
that's not even negotiating,'' Houston Rockets guard Eddie Johnson
told the ``Houston Chronicle.'' ``That's what we're disappointed
about. We're trying to address all of their needs (like) salaries
outpacing revenues . . . trying to come up with creative ways to
get them comfortable, but they don't even want to talk about it
unless it's a hard (salary) cap.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners' latest proposal would phase out the so-called Larry
Bird exception and create a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Bird exception allows teams to sign their own players, after
three years of service, to whatever amount the team and player
agree upon without regard to salary cap restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The owners offered an alternative that would keep the Bird
exception intact, but it would provide for protection to the owners
should the money going toward player salaries exceed 54 percent of
gross basketball revenue. That limit would be reduced to 50 percent
by the third year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the owners proposed lengthening the rookie salary
scale from three to five years, with only the first three years
guaranteed. Clubs also would have the right to match an offer from
other clubs after the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   A player would remain on the scale even longer if he enters the
league directly out of high school or after a few years in college.
It would provide for an additional year for each year the player
was under 20 years of age. An 18-year-old, for example, would be on
the scale for seven years, with the club having the option for two
more years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would limit player incentive clauses to no more
than 5 percent of their base salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The owners offered to increase minimum salaries slightly, with
increases based on years of service. The minimum for a veteran
would start at $325,000 and go up to $750,000 for a 10-year player.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects include:
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening of the league's ability to discipline players.
</P>
<P>
   Tying all salaries to a percentage of the salary cap. No
contract could exceed the team cap at the time it is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting most contracts to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring players to participate in mandatory off-season
training under the supervision of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring players under guaranteed contract to play in the
Continental Basketball Association if they are waived by their NBA
clubs. A Revamping of the drug policy to include marijuana,
amphetamines and barbiturates as banned substances. Currently, only
cocaine and heroin are banned.

SIDELINED ELWAY ITCHING TO PLAY AGAINST SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ When John Elway finally decided to return for
a 16th NFL season, he didn't anticipate spending his Sunday
afternoons standing on the sideline with ailing body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, it was a sore hamstring. Last week, it was a sore
back.
</P>
<P>
   This week? Elway's back is better. He practiced Wednesday for
the first time in a week and only the fifth time in the past three
weeks. Elway is expected to play in Sunday's game against the
Seahawks at the Kingdome, perhaps for the final time in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Elway doesn't just want to play, he needs to play. That's why he
decided to return rather than retire after the Broncos won their
first Super Bowl and there is little, if anything, left for Elway
to achieve or prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back to play. It's no fun being hurt,'' Elway said
Wednesday during his first conference-call interview of the season.
``It's frustrating being hurt. I came back to play football and I
was playing as good a football as I've ever played. So to get set
back like I have is really disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back in there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The hamstring Elway strained while scrambling in the Broncos'
Week 3 victory at Oakland is fine. It's the back he tweaked while
lifting weights after practice last Wednesday that forced Elway to
miss Sunday's game against Philadelphia and has him listed as
probable for this week's game.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's week has been filled with massages, heat and ice
treatments, ultrasound and stretching exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling better, but I'm not totally back yet,'' he said.
``I'm a lot better than I was Sunday and have been making progress
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Elway practiced without pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him playing without pain gives me pain,'' Seahawks coach
Dennis Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing as long as he has, and with the reckless abandon
he still flaunts, Elway has missed only 12 games due to injuries.
There were elbow and shoulder injuries and a concussion in his
rookie season in 1983, but none forced him to miss a start. Elway
missed one game in 1984 (shoulder); another in 1988 (sprained
ankle); four in 1992 (bruised shoulder); two in 1994 (strained
knee); and one in 1996 (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   So this thing with his back is something different _ the injury
and the inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's disappointing, but it's not enough to regret the
fact that I came back,'' Elway said.
</P>
<P>
   In Elway's absence, Bubby Brister has led the Broncos to their
first back-to-back wins without their icon of a quarterback. Of
course, the twin thrashings of the Washington Redskins and
Philadelphia Eagles have come against two teams that are 0-5.
</P>
<P>
   Brister has been downright Elway-esque, passing for four TDs in
a 41-16 rout of the Eagles, two in a 38-16 win over the Redskins
and two after replacing Elway in the Week 3 win at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   As good as he has been, Brister is no Elway. But then, who is?
Or has been? Or can be?
</P>
<P>
   ``The defining moments have made him special,'' Seahawks
defensive end Michael Sinclair said of Elway's 45 game-saving
drives, with the last coming in his first Super Bowl victory.
``That's what makes any player special. The defining moments that
come in crunch time define those players. That's what makes John
Elway special.''
</P>
<P>
   This is probably Elway's final season, and last appearance at
the Kingdome. He hasn't come right out and said that, but it is the
feeling among his teammates and those who know him best.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview with Fox television's football analyst
and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw, Elway did say he'd
return for a shot at winning three straight Super Bowls if the
Broncos can pull a repeat this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said `yes' so he'd get off it,'' Elway said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the laughter subsided, Elway added, ``The chances are that
I'll probably retire, but I just didn't want to shut the door. You
hate to walk away from a football team like I'm on now.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is to be it, Elway isn't making a big deal out of it and
doesn't want anyone else doing so, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying not to get too sentimental about the whole
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Seattle is special for Elway. He was born in Port
Angeles. His wife, Janet, is from Tacoma. And the rivalry with the
Seahawks always seems to bring out the best in Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his overpublicized showdowns with former Seahawks
linebacker Brian Bosworth in the late 1980s ranked at the top of
his memory list, Elway cracked, ``No, not really. He wasn't there
long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Elway remembers the noise in the Kingdome and the
nuisance the Seahawks have been over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some great rivalries with them and it will be one
that I'll always remember,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Elway doesn't need football as much as football
needs Elway. Last year, he sold his string of car dealerships in
the Denver area for $86 million. He has a family he longs to spend
more time with _ his wife, whom he starting dating as a freshman at
Stanford and married after his rookie season with the Broncos, and
their children, Jessica, Jordan, Juliana and Jack.
</P>
<P>
   As Janet puts it, ``We are normal people living abnormal
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop and smell the roses sometimes, and to reflect back
on what it's all about, you're a little bit in awe of it,'' Elway
said. ``We feel pretty lucky.''

LIKE FATHER, NOT YET LIKE SON  
 YOUNG IRWIN PERSEVERES IN BID TO QUALIFY FOR PRO TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their lives are at opposite ends of the professional golf
spectrum. But Steve Irwin says that when people realize he is the
son of Senior PGA Tour star Hale Irwin, it's mostly a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a little tough to be compared to my dad. A lot
of preconceived notions,'' said Irwin, 24, who recently moved to
the Valley from St. Louis, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being Hale Irwin's kid has its advantages, too, and I'd
sooner look at that side of it. The best part is that I've met so
many people in the golf world. A lot of special things with dad
have happened because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, there's a few other perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free lessons, free clubs and free balls,'' said Irwin, whose
parents moved to Paradise Valley a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Irwin might need all of those things by the time this week
is over. He is one of 78 hopefuls going through the PGA/Nike Tour
first-stage qualifier at Talking Stick Golf Club in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a golf marathon,'' said Irwin, who had a 1-under 69 in
Tuesday's first round before a wind-blown 80 knocked him back into
a tie for 60th place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the outlook is bleak for the youngster, who
yearns to be among the top 25 players to advance to the second
stage of qualifying. With 36 holes to play, he'll need more 69s to
have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll probably need more like a couple of 65s, but I'm
not giving up,'' Irwin said. ``I just had one of those days when
everything hit the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make it past the first stage of qualifying last year,
either. But that is a big part of this process, gaining
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as if Steve Irwin is well-grounded, that would be a
good observation. Hey, he could be just another rich kid, what with
his father already having won nearly $7.5 million in a little over
three years on the 50-and-older circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what he's done,'' Steve Irwin said. ``I think the
difference between Hale Irwin back when he played on the regular
tour and the one out there today on the senior tour is that he's
much more patient now. His success and the less stressful schedule
as a senior has just boosted him to a different level.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve is obviously light-years from there. But he is not going
to throw in his golf towel and fly off in his father's new
eight-seat Beechjet, which often is anchored at Scottsdale Airpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``My record isn't exactly stellar, but I'm not giving up (a
career in professional golf) even if I don't make it out of here
this week,'' he said. ``I might work for my dad in his golf course
design business some of the time, but I'm going to keep working on
my game, too.''
</P>
<P>
   True grit is another characteristic that Irwin inherited from
his father, who was an All-Big 8 defensive back at Colorado before
he won the NCAA golf championship in 1967, his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a little bit of football in high school. I was a
linebacker,'' said Steve, who is about 4 inches shorter than his
6-foot father. ``But I was too small, and I wanted to concentrate
on golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, about the only things my game has in common with my dad's
is that we both are pretty accurate and have good short games.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really serious about golf, although this week has been
pretty stressful,'' said Irwin, who also played golf for Colorado
but never finished better than runner-up in a college tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything you want badly causes stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you peer at the leader board and find yourself
18 shots off the pace and trailing dozens of former All-Americans
and ex-tour players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at the talent, this is an incredible
(first-stage) group of guys to have to go up against. Maybe the
best in the country,'' Irwin said of such players as Rory
Sabbatini, Ted Purdy, Todd Demsey and Bill Lunde _ all former
first-team All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But desire has a lot to do with it, too. If you can get your
heart and your head into it _ and I know it sounds like a cliche _
anything is possible. I just feel like eventually, I'm going to get
it done.'' &QL;

HUSKIES' MARQUES TUIASOSOPO: ON THE LOOSE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You imagine Utah State defensive coaches in the video
room this week, puzzling over the problem of Marques Tuiasosopo.
</P>
<P>
   Will he throw it, as he did for 270 yards in his Washington
debut against Nebraska last year?
</P>
<P>
   Will he hand it off? Or will he hotfoot it to the perimeter and
create chaos over there, as he did with a 42-yard touchdown run
against Oregon in 1997 and another bolt of 46 yards in September
against BYU?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he makes the defense uncomfortable,'' said UW offensive
guard Tony Coats, recalling a play earlier this season. ``When he
came in, they said, `Option, option, watch the option.' And we ran
it up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   If his unpredictability is frazzling the Utah State braintrust,
Manu and Tina Tuiasosopo can relate. They are Marques' parents, and
he has driven them crazy before, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawk fans will remember Manu Tuiasosopo as an undersized but
productive defensive tackle from UCLA who played here from 1979-83.
When he would go home at night, he would often hear of little
Marques' latest indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marques,'' Manu says, ``was our most hyperactive kid.''
</P>
<P>
   There are five Tuiasosopo kids. About every other day, you see
one of their names in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie is a senior volleyball player at the UW, followed by
Marques, a 6-foot-2, 210-pound sophomore quarterback. Then there is
Zach, a football player at Woodinville High; Matt, a 6-foot,
seventh-grade pitcher and shortstop who throws 75 mph and led
Woodinville West to within an out of the Little League World Series
this year; and 8-year-old Ashley, who told Marques the other day
she had a goal and an assist in her soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know she knew what an assist was,'' Marques
says. ``She's pretty good in her terminology.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a model family, everybody agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, God-lovin' folks,'' says Pat Conniff, the Husky fullback
from Woodinville. ``Christians. They support each other in
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marques came to Washington a year ago, polite and well-spoken.
He froze sportswriters by addressing them ``Mister ...'' But Manu
says you don't know the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I had a lot of out-in-the-shed, father-son type of
deals,'' Manu says. ``He was very, very, very active.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marques was little and the family would go out, restaurant
personnel would cringe at their approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bouncing off walls, breaking lights, climbing over tables,''
Manu recited. ``In three minutes, I'm outside, talking to him.
Tipping over salt shakers, poking fun at Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I at times stayed up at night, wondering where
this came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Marques grew out of it. He pretty much corroborates his
dad's story, something he wouldn't have done a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say something, and I'd always have to have the last
word,'' Marques says. ``I didn't (understand) at the time a lot of
things he would do. But now that I look back: You're right, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Conniff knows how different Marques is today from the kid he
made friends with in fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marques and Leslie live together,'' he said. ``I've never
heard of a brother and sister living together. They share a
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tuiasosopo parents sensed it might be a long childhood when
Marques was 2 or 3. Somehow, with the house locked up, he exited
through a front window and went off to explore the neighborhood,
leaving them to search.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Marques is just as elusive, only he's channeled it.
He became a three-sport standout at Woodinville, leading the
Falcons to the 1996 state quarterfinals, starting on the basketball
team, playing shortstop well enough to get drafted in the 28th
round by the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   He got seriously recruited, by Washington, Cal, UCLA and Notre
Dame. Some schools saw him as a safety. If the Huskies truly knew
this was a quarterback, they were prescient; he ran an option
offense at Woodinville, throwing only 75 passes as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a flair for the dynamic,'' said Woodinville
coach Terry Agnew. ``Whether it was picking up a fumble and
returning it 90 yards for a touchdown, or the other team would
score, and he'd break a 60- or 70-yard run on the first or second
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about the first thing Tuiasosopo said when he arrived at
Washington was, ``I'm a quarterback.'' Then he went out and proved
it against Nebraska and Oregon, filling in for an injured Brock
Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Huard's misfortune is now Tuiasosopo's opportunity. Just as the
Huskies enter a softer part of their schedule, Huard is out 2-3
weeks because of a shoulder separation. The chance is there for
Tuiasosopo to shine, and swell the clamor from a segment of Husky
fans who prefer his versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Brock's offense,'' Tuiasosopo insists. ``One or two more
years of Huard can only be good for me and the program. He's been
like, I guess you could say, the toast of this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's an energy about Tuiasosopo that seems to infect
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an exciting football player,'' Conniff says. ``He's
probably up there with the (Donovan) McNabbs and all those exciting
ballplayers that bring another dimension to the game. The crowd
loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the dash he brings, there's something Tuiasosopo hasn't
yet delivered in the three games in which he has played
extensively: a victory. He will try to get it against a team whose
defensive line coach, Mike Tuiasosopo, is his father's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him: `Marques, they're not going to win because of
you,''' Manu says. ``Everybody has a role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Marques Tuiasosopo is listening.

YOUTH IS SERVED, BUT PLAN NOT ATTRACTING NEW HUNTERS  
 PERMITS GOING TO KIDS WHO OFTEN HUNT WITH DAD 
</HEADLINE>
 HUNTERS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ The average age of big-game hunters is about 45.
Does that mean we have a dying breed?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, say those who study such things. Somewhere, they say,
we missed a generation of hunters. Lost was a generation of dads
who hunt and are willing to teach their children. Whether that is
good or bad is a matter of personal opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Most researchers think it happened because of urbanization. It's
expensive and time consuming to take a big-game hunting trip.
Working parents often don't have that time to give. In rural areas,
hunting is a way of life. But rural living also is a dying way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to gain back some of those hunters, about five
years ago the Arizona Game and Fish Commission decided to allow
youths to hunt for doves, elk and javelina without competition from
adults. Deer and waterfowl were added later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I expected was to see a single mother drive up in a
station wagon with her child and ask directions how to hunt,'' said
Bill Watt, an information specialist for Game and Fish in
Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened. We're still talking about big money.
Big-bore rifles are expensive. So is the ammunition. That's not to
mention the gear for camping out. Then there's the time.
</P>
<P>
   Two new commissioners, Bill Berlat of Tucson and Dennis Manning
of Alpine, are believers in youth hunts. They proposed that 5
percent of all big-game permits go to young hunters.
</P>
<P>
   So let's look at that. A four-day youth hunt for cow elk began
last Friday in Unit 7 near Flagstaff. Young hunters could enter a
computer drawing for 275 cow permits. That was the entire allotment
of cows for that unit. In other words, no other rifle shooters but
youths will hunt cows in that area.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the youth cow elk hunt allowed 100 to 150 young
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing a number of young hunters and their fathers,
it became apparent that most would have hunted anyway if they were
drawn. In other words, they came from hunting families that would
have hunted even if youth permits didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Pratt and son Loren operate a farm in Maricopa and own a
ranch near Payson. Loren's sons (Edward's grandsons) are David, 4,
and Douglas, 7.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first junior hunt for Douglas. ``He was on a deer
hunt two years ago and got lots of shots, but he couldn't hit
anything,'' Loren said.
</P>
<P>
   This was three generations of hunters. They'd have gone anyway
if drawn, but the youth hunt was a chance to get an easy permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ought to be automatic that these kids get a
permit,'' Loren said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Keuer and his son, Aaron, 11, of Tucson were there, too.
Aaron hadn't gotten a shot. They'd seen elk, but circumstances for
a shot had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Aaron gets a shot, it'll be a good one,'' Kurt said.
``He'll kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's sister, Amy, killed an elk three years ago when she was
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some competition there,'' Kurt said. ``That was a
regular hunt, and she hit the elk at 215 yards _ twice. There were
six men on that trip that didn't see an elk.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Gallagher, 11, of Peoria killed his elk the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking along, it came over a hill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Alan, said, ``It's a good way to get them going _ a
father and son thing. They (Game and Fish) did it right this year,
giving them the whole unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Both father and son said they'd have hunted together even
without the youth hunt.
</P>
<P>
   John Solares of Tubac had a different point of view.
</P>
<P>
   His son, John Paul, 13, killed a big cow elk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends I hunt with every year,'' the father said.
``This is more time to spend with my kids. If we (the adults) don't
get drawn, we still can go out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a theory that this youth hunt could be more successful
if the eligible age were raised to 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real barrier to the current system,'' said Tice
Supplee, head of the Game and Fish's Game Branch. ``An older young
person can drive. If we raised the ante on who can play, we have
kids (who can drive) taking kids (who can't).''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Janisch, information specialist for Game and Fish, said the
department's highly successful fishing clinics are different from
youth big-game hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catching a couple of bluegill on an inadequate rod is a lot
different than big-game hunting,'' he said. ``It's more like
starting a kid fly-fishing at Lees Ferry. Handing a kid a .30-06 is
like handing a kid a fly rod. A .22 would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Watt agrees. ``Maybe we should put more emphasis on small
game,'' he said. ``What if we had a squirrel hunt? We could get
hunter education instructors to take out the kids. They could use
.410s or 20-gauges to shoot. It would be a good, supervised hunt.
Any kid could come. I'd also like to see the youth dove and duck
hunts expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing very few new hunters at these big-game hunts.
Most of it is hunting families. We need to be introducing
non-hunting kids to the sport. The ones we're seeing here would go
anyway.'' &QL;

2ND-GUESSED NEDNEY HASN'T LOST CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're moody. Goofy.
</P>
<P>
   They probably shouldn't be allowed to waltz in and settle an
issue that others have beaten their brains out for three hours
trying to settle.
</P>
<P>
   With one swing of his leg, a professional football kicker can
make a name or be called one.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nedney, who kicks for the Cardinals, lives for those
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to, `Are you ready to perform?' '' Nedney
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been well documented that Nedney didn't get his chance
last Sunday. With 5 seconds to play and the Cardinals needing a
field goal to send Oakland into overtime, Nedney was sent onto the
field for what would have been a 55-yard attempt into a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin thought his offense could complete a
quick out after a Raiders timeout to knock a few yards off the try.
Tobin called Nedney back.
</P>
<P>
   Replays show that the receiver, Eric Metcalf, made the catch and
stepped out of bounds for a two-yard gain with two seconds left,
but the officiating crew ruled that time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney was disappointed the coach didn't leave him out there to
try it from 55. But he said on Wednesday that his confidence is not
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a play that players live for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, Nedney said, he will try to offer input to Tobin,
something he did not do Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lesson learned there,'' Nedney said. ``The next
time we're in a field-goal situation where I think I have the leg
and the conditions are favorable, I'll be standing there next to
Coach Tobin giving him an extra nudge. He was probably looking for
something there to influence his decision. If it's a kick I know I
can make and I see him pondering, I'll let him know.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said after the game he didn't ask for Nedney's input.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably isn't a kicker in the world who wouldn't have
said, `Put me in Coach, I can make it,' '' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   In slightly less than one year with the Cardinals, Nedney has
yet to miss a field goal inside 43 yards (14-14). Beyond, he is two
for nine, including a career-long 47-yarder against Philadelphia
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking legend Jan Stenerud had worked during the summer with
Nedney, who is best known for putting his kickoffs deep into the
end zone with his strong left leg but also known for hooking his
long field-goal tries.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney said Stenerud found him to be technically sound. They
spent most of their time together on the day-to-day preparation in
practice, the mental game of the kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney, 25, who was signed last Oct. 14 to replace Kevin Butler,
acknowledges that his kicks do have a natural draw, similar to the
flight of a golf shot. For the past two weeks, Nedney has offset
the line on his tries beyond 47 yards to the left to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, on the longer field goals a kicker thinks he has to
swing harder,'' Tobin said. ``It's like a golf shot. On the long
ones sometimes you think you have to get more power into it, and
you change your motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe has a strong enough leg that if we can get him to swing
with the same rhythm his consistency level outside 43 yards will
pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedney also has become the defense's buddy with his booming
kickoffs. He had a Cardinals-record 16 touchbacks last season after
being the NFL-co-leader with 20 while with the Miami Dolphins in
1996, his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells you that he has a strong leg,'' said Cardinals
special teams coach Al Everest. ``The question is consistency. He's
perfect inside 43 yards, which is a pretty good statistic, and no
kicker is perfect beyond that. How far out is he accurate, it
depends on the day, the wind and the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kick on Sunday was a critical kick, not one we were just
going to slap in before halftime. In that situation, you might let
him try one from there. These were different circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he remains confident in Nedney. It is how far that
confidence extends that was at issue. In pregame, Nedney warms up
out to 53 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel good at 53 we pull it back to 58,'' he said. ``In a
game, inside 55 I feel I definitely have a shot. Outside of that it
depends on conditions.'' &QL;

   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC DIVISIONDALLAS STARS &QL; 
Last year: 49-22-11, lost in conference finals. &QL; 
Key addition: F Brett Hull (free agent). &QL; 
Outlook: The Stars have been a strong defensive team in search of a
big goal scorer. At least on paper, Hull's addition appears to fill
their major void and improve the Stars' chances of shining in the
postseason. &QL; 
KINGS &QL; 
Last year: 38-33-11, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key additions: D Steve Duchesne (free agent), D Doug Bodger
(trade). &QL; 
Key subtraction: D Aki Berg (contract dispute). &QL; 
Outlook: Like Dallas, the Kings have an excellent defense. The
addition of Duchesne should have a positive impact on the power
play. The team's biggest deficiency is the lack of a game-breaking
goal scorer. &QL; 
PHOENIX COYOTES &QL; 
Last year: 35-35-12, lost in first round &QL; 
Key additions: F Greg Adams (free agent), D Jyrki Lumme (free
agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Murray Baron (free agent), C Craig Janney
(trade), F Mike Gartner (retired). &QL; 
Outlook: Keith Tkachuk showed his leadership skills by holding out
despite being under contract. And the Coyotes' defensive
shortcomings leave them a notch below the Stars and Kings. Look for
a swift playoff exit. &QL; 
MIGHTY DUCKS &QL; 
Last year: 26-43-13, missed playoffs &QL; 
Key additions: D Frederik Olausson (free agent), D Kevin Haller
(trade), F Stu Grimson (trade), D Pascal Trepanier. &QL; 
Key subtractions: F Scott Young (free agent), G Mikhail Shtalenkov
(expansion draft). &QL; 
Outlook: The Mighty Ducks have a mediocre defense and lack
offensive depth. They also have two of the best players on the
planet in Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne. That should be enough to
lift them out of the cellar and, if everything goes well, into the
playoffs. &QL; 
SAN JOSE SHARKS &QL; 
Last year: 34-38-10, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key additions: D Bob Rouse (free agent), D Gary Suter (free
agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: F John MacLean (free agency), G Kelly Hrudey
(retired). &QL; 
Outlook: Two key offensive players, Owen Nolan and Jeff Friesen,
remain unsigned, the sort of turmoil that can shake even an
excellent team. And the Sharks are not an excellent team.CENTRAL
DIVISIONDETROIT RED WINGS &QL; 
Last year: 44-23-15, won Stanley Cup. &QL; 
Key addition: D Uwe Krupp (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Bob Rouse (free agent), D Dmitri Mironov (free
agent), D Slava Fetisov (retired). &QL; 
Outlook: When discussing the two-time defending champions, everyone
focuses on stars such as Sergei Fedorov and Steve Yzerman. The key
to this team, however, is its depth. Only if coach Scotty Bowman is
unable to return from health problems are the Wings likely to fall
shy of a strong run at another Stanley Cup. &QL; 
ST. LOUIS BLUES &QL; 
Last year: 45-29-8, lost in second round. &QL; 
Key addition: F Scott Young (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Steve Duchesne (free agent), F Brett Hull (free
agent), C Darren Turcotte (trade). &QL; 
Outlook: The Blues' offense took two major hits in free agency,
which means they will have to rely more heavily than last season on
defense and the goaltending of Grant Fuhr. &QL; 
CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS &QL; 
Last year: 30-39-13, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key additions: C Doug Gilmour (free agent), C Ed Olczyk (free
agent), D Paul Coffey (trade), G Mark Fitzpatrick (trade). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Gary Suter (free agency), G Chris Terreri
(trade). &QL; 
Outlook: The Blackhawks added a couple of big-name veterans over
the summer after missing the playoffs for the first time in three
decades. They should be better because of the boost to their woeful
offense, but don't expect miracles. &QL; 
NASHVILLE PREDATORS &QL; 
Last year: First-year expansion team. &QL; 
Key players: G Mike Dunham, F Sergei Krivokrasov. &QL; 
Outlook: The Predators are an expansion team, which tells you most
of what you need to know.NORTHWEST DIVISIONCOLORADO AVALANCHE &QL; 
Last year: 39-26-17, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key additions: D Wade Belak (1994 draft), C Chris Drury (1994
draft). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Uwe Krupp (expansion draft), F Jari Kurri
(retired). &QL; 
Outlook: The Avalanche has skill galore up front with stars Peter
Forsberg, Joe Sakic and Valeri Kamensky. The questions are on
defense and on the power play, which lacks unsigned quarterback
Sandis Ozolinsh. &QL; 
EDMONTON OILERS &QL; 
Last year: 35-37-10, lost in second round. &QL; 
Key additions: G Mikhail Shtalenkov (trade), F Pat Falloon (free
agent), D Marty McSorley (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: G Curtis Joseph (free agent), F Scott Fraser
(free agent). &QL; 
Outlook: The Oilers will miss Joseph, and at least for the time
being, they will miss star forward Doug Weight, who is unsigned.
But after the Avalanche, they are the best of a weak division. &QL; 
VANCOUVER CANUCKS &QL; 
Last year: 25-43-14, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key addition: D Murray Baron (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: G Arturs Irbe (free agent), D Jyrki Lumme (free
agent). &QL; 
Outlook: With Pavel Bure, the Canucks were pitiful last season. Now
they are without their disgruntled superstar, who has vowed never
to play for the Canucks again. Vancouver may not miss the
distraction of Bure. They will, however, miss his goals. What a
waste of Mark Messier's twilight years. &QL; 
CALGARY FLAMES &QL; 
Last year: 26-41-15, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key additions: D Phil Housley (free agent), G Ken Wregget (trade). &QL; 
Key subtraction: F Ronnie Stern (free agent. &QL; 
Outlook: The Flames may be the NHL's youngest team, but
inexperience usually is accompanied by struggles. These Flames will
be no different. Adding to the confusion, the Flames' top veteran,
winger Theo Fleury, is likely to be traded because he'll be a free
agent after the season. &QL; 
Playoff teams: Dallas, Kings, Detroit, St. Louis, Colorado,
Edmonton, Phoenix, Mighty Ducks. &QL; 
Stanley Cup finalist: Detroit.EASTERN CONFERENCEATLANTIC
DIVISIONPHILADELPHIA FLYERS &QL; 
Last year: 42-29-11, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key additions: G John Vanbiesbrouck (free agent), C Marc Bureau
(free agent), LW Valeri Zelepukin. &QL; 
Key subtractions: G Sean Burke (free agent), D Paul Coffey
(trade). &QL; 
Outlook: General manager Bobby Clarke has challenged Eric Lindros
to consistently play like the franchise player he is supposed to
be. If he does, and if Vanbiesbrouck plays up to the standards he
set earlier in his career, the Flyers will be at the head of their
conference. &QL; 
NEW JERSEY DEVILS &QL; 
Last year: 48-23-11, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key addition: G Chris Terreri (trade), C Brendan Morrison (1993
draft). &QL; 
Key subtractions: C Doug Gilmour (free agent), F Steve Thomas (free
agent). &QL; 
Outlook: The Devils have been overly dependent on G Martin Brodeur
the last couple of years and may be even more so this year now that
Gilmour is gone. How the Devils respond to new coach Robbie Ftorek,
who has replaced Jacques Lemaire, will have much to say about their
success this season. &QL; 
PITTSBURGH PENGUINS &QL; 
Last year: 40-24-18, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key additions: F German Titov (trade), D Bobby Dollas (trade). &QL; 
Key subtractions: C Ron Francis (free agent), D Fredrik Olausson
(free agent), C Ed Olczyk (free agent), G Ken Wregget (trade). &QL; 
Outlook: The financially troubled Penguins now must adjust to life
without Francis, just a year after adjusting to life without Mario
Lemieux. At least they still have Jaromir Jagr. But economic
instability usually has a way of translating into on-ice
difficulties. &QL; 
NEW YORK RANGERS &QL; 
Last year: 25-39-18, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key additions: F John MacLean (free agent), D Zarley Zalapski (free
agent), F Scott Fraser (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: C Pat LaFontaine (retired), D Bruce Driver
(retired). &QL; 
Outlook: As usual, the Rangers threw money around in the offseason
to try to compensate for their deficiencies. Who ever would have
expected a team with Wayne Gretzky to score only 197 goals in a
season? Gretzky once scored 92 by himself. The fact that
18-year-old Manny Malhotra made the roster either means he's a
prodigy, or it means the Rangers are desperate. &QL; 
NEW YORK ISLANDERS &QL; 
Last year: 30-41-11, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key addition: F Dimitri Nabokov (trade). &QL; 
Key subtraction: G Eric Fichaud (trade). &QL; 
Outlook: The big drama in their season already has happened: a
court has ordered them to play at the Nassau Coliseum, which they
say is unsafe. Opposing goalies will be very safe, however, because
star forward Ziggy Palffy is unsigned.NORTHEAST DIVISIONBOSTON
BRUINS &QL; 
Last year: 39-30-13, lost in first round. &QL; 
Key addition: D Dennis Vaske (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Jon Rohloff (free agent). &QL; 
Outlook: Bruins coach Pat Burns worked a miracle last year, quickly
lifting the worst team in the NHL into the playoffs. Rookie Sergei
Samsonov starred last season, and the Bruins need 1997 top draft
choice Joe Thornton to follow suit this time around. &QL; 
BUFFALO SABRES &QL; 
Last year: 36-29-17, lost in conference finals. &QL; 
Key addition: G Dwayne Roloson (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: F Randy Burridge, G Steve Shields. &QL; 
Outlook: As goalie Dominik Hasek goes, so go the Sabres. And Hasek
usually goes well. Without him, the offensively weak Sabres are
mediocre. Even with him, they are no threat to win the Stanley Cup,
but nonetheless are a team no one wants to face in the playoffs. &QL; 
OTTAWA SENATORS &QL; 
Last year: 34-33-15, lost in second round. &QL; 
Key addition: C David Oliver. &QL; 
Key subtractions: F Randy Cunneyworth (free agent), F Pat Falloon
(free agent). &QL; 
Outlook: Once the joke of the NHL, the Senators won a playoff
series for the first time in their history, led by goalie Damian
Rhodes. The Senators' weakness is offense, and it won't help that
star forward Daniel Alfredsson will miss the first two months
because of a knee injury. &QL; 
MONTREAL CANADIENS &QL; 
Last year: 37-32-13, lost in second round. &QL; 
Key addition: G Jose Theodore (1994 draft). &QL; 
Key subtractions: C Marc Bureau (free agent), D Zarley Zalapski
(free agent), G Andy Moog (retired). &QL; 
Outlook: Led by Mark Recchi, the Canadiens have offensive
firepower, though not nearly enough to make anyone forget Maurice
Richard and Guy Lafleur. The questions are on defense and in goal. &QL; 
TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS &QL; 
Last year: 30-43-9, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key additions: G Curtis Joseph (free agent), F Steve Thomas (free
agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: F Wendel Clark (free agent). &QL; 
Outlook: The Maple Leafs move into the Eastern Conference,
rekindling their rivalry with the Canadiens. But the move won't do
anything to lift them out of the doldrums they've endured for most
of the last 30 years. They also will move out of Maple Leaf Gardens
in February. Is nothing sacred?SOUTHEAST DIVISIONWASHINGTON
CAPITALS &QL; 
Last year: 40-30-12, lost in Stanley Cup finals. &QL; 
Key additions: G Rick Tabaracci (trade), D Dmitri Mironov (free
agent). &QL; 
Key subtractions: D Phil Housley (waived), G Bill Ranford (trade). &QL; 
Outlook: The Capitals are coming off the first Stanley Cup finals
appearance in their history, a sweep at the hands of the Red Wings.
Can they get there again? Probably not, but no one thought they
could last year, either _ except for their coach, Mighty Ducks
discard Ron Wilson. With such stars as goalie Olaf Kolzig and
forward Peter Bondra, the Caps should not be overlooked. &QL; 
CAROLINA HURRICANES &QL; 
Last year: 33-41-8, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key addition: C Ron Francis (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtraction: D Kevin Haller (trade). &QL; 
Outlook: The Hurricanes are hoping the addition of Francis can lift
them from ineptitude and draw some fans to their games. Last
season, the empty seats in North Carolina had the Hurricanes pining
for their former home in Hartford. The Hurricanes/Whalers have a
shot at their first playoff berth since 1991. &QL; 
FLORIDA PANTHERS &QL; 
Last year: 24-43-15, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key addition: G Sean Burke (free agent). &QL; 
Key subtraction: G John Vanbiesbrouck (free agent). &QL; 
Outlook: In an instant, the Panthers went from being a 1996 Stanley
Cup finalist to one of the worst teams. They should improve a bit
under new coach Terry Murray, but it's doubtful they'll improve
enough to make their fans want to throw rats on the ice at their
new arena. &QL; 
TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING &QL; 
Last year: 17-55-10, missed playoffs. &QL; 
Key additions: F Wendel Clark (free agent), C Craig Janney (trade),
G Bill Ranford (trade), F Benoit Hogue (free agent), C Vincent
Lecavalier (1998 draft). &QL; 
Key subtractions: G Mark Fitzpatrick (trade), F Louie DeBrusk. &QL; 
Outlook: The horrid Lightning was the worst team in the league last
season, and it has reacted by adding numerous players who appear to
be either too old or too young to be able to effect an immediate
turnaround. &QL; 
Playoff teams: Philadelphia, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Boston,
Buffalo, Ottawa, Washington, Carolina. &QL; 
Stanley Cup finalist: Philadelphia. &QL; 
Stanley Cup champion: Once again, the Red Wings' depth and talent
will prevail once the real action begins in April.

KEALY SINGS PRAISES OF IRISH KICKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his critics, from the crackpots and cowards to the more
civil but still manic armchair experts, Notre Dame placekicker Jim
Sanson still has many admirers. One of them was his holder for a
good part of eight football seasons together, from Pop Warner
leagues in Scottsdale through St. Mary's High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an outstanding leg,'' Ryan Kealy said. ``He's so
impressive to hold for and to watch kick. He's a great athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy was the quarterback on the 1995 St. Mary's team that went
14-0 and won the state Class 5A championship. He now is Arizona
State's quarterback, a third-year sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy missed most of last week's loss to Southern California
with his first-ever concussion. But he is back at practice this
week, reporting no ill effects, and will start Saturday against
Notre Dame at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sanson, a junior, will be on the opposite sideline. It's a St.
Mary's reunion of sorts, and it includes ASU sophomore wide
receiver Tariq McDonald and Willie Daniel, a freshman defensive
back.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy and Sanson hung out a lot together as kids, spending time
at each other's homes. Their families remain close, and Kealy went
with his parents to the Sanson's Christmas party last year. Jim,
however, wasn't there because Notre Dame was preparing for the
Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Farrell, the longtime St. Mary's coach, said Kealy and
Sanson showed up practically as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out of the same mold,'' he said. ``Very committed to
the game. Very disciplined. Both became leaders, not just by the
quality of their play but the quality of their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanson did a lot more for Farrell than just kick. He was a
skilled, versatile player and the captain of the team. He played
defensive back and receiver, catching 10 of Kealy's passes in the
title game against Scottsdale Horizon _ at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did everything,'' said Kealy, who held for a 58-yard field
goal Sanson made against Mesa Westwood in 1994, the longest in the
country that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a utilized player out there. He contributed in so
many different ways. I don't think he ever got the credit for how
good an overall athlete he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanson, meanwhile, is just as effusive in his praise of Kealy
and McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brag to everyone out here about Ryan and Tariq,'' said
Sanson, who checks the Internet to keep up with his former
teammates. ``Our team has such high expectations of those two
because of everything I've said.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who is emerging as a potent weapon for the Sun Devils,
was Kealy's favorite receiver at St. Mary's. Sanson was the
secondary guy. But during his freshman year at Notre Dame, after
winning the kicking job and helping beat No. 6 Texas with a late
field goal, Sanson became a primary target.
</P>
<P>
   He was the subject of anonymous death threats and harassment
after missing a crucial extra point in an overtime loss to USC as a
freshman, then took more abuse and was benched after missing three
field goals in another loss to USC last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanson has reclaimed the job this year and has made five of
six field-goal attempts so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Jimmy is he always comes back,'' Kealy said.
``He's such a great competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy might do well to take note. He still tends to get down on
himself, like after the Oregon State game. ASU won, 24-3, but Kealy
had a poor game statistically and was close to being despondent
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about Kealy struggling and being unhappy,'' Sanson
said. ``Ryan isn't struggling. Ryan is just Ryan. He's always been
hard on himself. I know Ryan, especially in our game, will rise to
the occasion and have one of his best games.'' &QL;

PLENTY OF WATER, DUCKS AT BALDWIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR CITY _ Just when you thought you'd heard the last of El
Nino, waterfowlers might get the final word. For the first time in
three years, Baldwin Lake holds enough water to host hunters for
the opening day of duck season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck season at Baldwin is based solely on water,'' said Jim
Davis, a Department of Fish and Game associate wildlife biologist
in nearby Big Bear Lake. ``If there is no water, there are no
ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the time there is no water in this shallow basin
perched high in the San Bernardino Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The area typically doesn't get much runoff; even in years when
it does, streams are diverted for water rights and, for the most
part, Baldwin remains parched. Maps designate this flat spot east
of Big Bear as a dry lake. Not since the fall of 1995 _ the last
time Baldwin was considered huntable _ have waterfowl reports
featured duck counts from the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime last December the lake got water, but usually it
freezes over at night by that time,'' Davis said. ``Guys actually
chopped up the ice and put boats in.''
</P>
<P>
   Their success rate? ``Limited,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   It's all based on what you consider huntable, and Baldwin Lake
will definitely be huntable for Saturday's waterfowl opener ... and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be huntable all season this year,'' said Davis.
``What's going to limit the hunting after November is the cold and
how much it's going to freeze at night. And if it's not frozen
over, you can essentially have it to yourself; we don't get much
hunting pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to El Nino's watershed winter, the lake is between a
third- and half-full, or about 100 to 150 huntable surface acres
out of a 300-acre capacity. (When full, the lake measures 4 feet at
its deepest point.)
</P>
<P>
   However cold it might be, late-season hunting has been fruitful
in years past, when daytime thaws allow for easier access at
Baldwin. Shooting is allowed only from a boat that is completely
surrounded by water. The lake had enough water to attract hunters
during the falls of 1994 and 1995; shotguns were silent during the
drought of 1989-93, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   At present, he reports strictly resident populations of birds _
``mostly mallards, a few gadwalls and ruddy ducks and a ton of
coots'' _ and no migratory movement at all. No geese, either. The
biologist expects to see plenty of pintails, shovelers and teals,
along with flocks of Canada geese, by mid-December and on through
season's end Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get out on the lake anywhere and expect to see birds
flying over and get good pass-shooting,'' Davis said. ``The problem
is cover is very limited and you have to be pretty camouflaged out.
Bring a portable blind system - some sort of camo over a frame on
the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Permanent blinds are not permitted at the lake and shooting is
forbidden in certain spots, particularly near the west-end
launching area, due to the proximity of the Big Bear City
municipality, adjacent highways and private property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a wilderness experience, but it is a remote area,''
Davis said. ``You can spend a couple of days exploring the area for
deer and quail hunts and do a waterfowl hunt someplace in the
middle of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Entry permits are required for the season's first seven shoot
days, which are on Wednesdays and Saturdays only; the requisite is
lifted after Oct. 31. Only 17 permits may be issued per shoot day
during the quota period, and applications must be received by the
DFG's state headquarters 17 days prior to a desired shoot day. That
means if you haven't already applied, it's too late to hunt at
Baldwin Lake before Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   To apply to hunt on Oct. 28 or Oct. 31, applications must be in
by Saturday or Wednesday, respectively. The application fee is
$1.05 per hunt day; mail it with your request to the DFG's License
and Revenue Branch, 3211 S St., Sacramento, CA 95816.
</P>
<P>
   For additional permit information, call (916) 227-2244. For
questions specifically regarding Baldwin Lake, contact Davis at
(909) 866-1549.

REGION BREAKUP REFLECTS CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ The breakup of Department of Fish and Game
Region 5 headquartered in Long Beach reflects several recent
developments that impact the state's regulation of hunting and
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the department's administrative regions, Region 5
oversaw operations in Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange,
San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, Imperial, Inyo and Mono
counties. It was disbanded on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The five coastal counties will now compose a retooled Region 5,
or the South Coast Region, and the remaining interior counties will
fall under the jurisdiction of a new Region 6 _ the Inland
Deserts-Eastern Sierra Region.
</P>
<P>
   The move was designed to better serve the natural resources _
wildlife and habitat _ and to improve communications with the
public. The split and the way it was broken up _ west counties and
east counties _ is generally lauded by the Long Beach office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been long overdue. With 10 counties it was a large
region, to such an extent that it had become cumbersome to
operate,'' said one Long Beach employee who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Largely criticized, however, is the decision to make Long Beach
the temporary headquarters of the Inland Deserts-Eastern Sierra
Region and San Diego the home base of the South Coast Region, which
includes Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to fathom why,'' the employee said. ``Is moving
the coastal region to San Diego or maintaining the headquarters in
the Los Angeles area better?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that most of the population is here (in the Los
Angeles area), and it's the central location for a coastal area.
Geographically, it makes sense to have the South Coast Region
remain headquartered in Long Beach or at least somewhere in the Los
Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, it means a disruption of a lot of lives here (at
the Long Beach office); in the short term, that can't improve
communications with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The inland region will eventually be based in Chino, though no
date for the relocation has been set, officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the unlawful planting of Northern pike in Plumas
County's Lake Davis and last October's controversial effort to
chemically eradicate the destructive fish, Gov. Pete Wilson signed
into law Sept. 14 a bill to make more drastic the penalties for
planting ``aquatic nuisance species'' in state waters.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will increase the fine
for persons convicted of planting such species from a maximum of
$1,000 to as much as $50,000. It also creates an award of up to
$50,000 for information leading to the arrest or criminal
conviction of offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it will be a deterrent,'' said Bruce Barngrover,
senior hatchery supervisor for the DFG's Sacramento Valley-Central
Sierra Region headquarters in Rancho Cordova, which oversees Lake
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unauthorized release of fish, or any animal, into the wild is
something we have big concerns about,'' Barngrover said. ``There
are native species and introduced organisms that could be
compromised, as witnessed by the pike. It is a voracious predatory
that eats the trout in the lake, and, if it got out of the lake,
could devastate the salmon and steelhead fisheries downstream, not
to mention all the other fish resources in the state.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state Fish and Game Commission, which mandates regulations
for the DFG, has largely been in charge of managing recreational
activities, including sport-fishing takes, while the state
legislature oversees laws managing commercial harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   That process will change Jan. 1. That's when a bill Wilson
signed into law Sept. 30 will put the handling of commercial
regulatory changes squarely on the shoulders of the Fish and Game
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative process is so time consuming that sometimes
you can't get a law change in place to prevent further loss or
damage to your resource,'' said Jack Edwards, spokesman for the
DFG's state headquarters in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Life Management Act is being cheered by many
environmental groups and commercial anglers alike for having the
potential to greatly expedite the course of making alterations to
commercial-fishing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit is that it takes the politics out of the
process,'' said Tom Raftican, president of United Anglers of
Southern California, a saltwater fish-preservation group. ``The
state had a broad mandate to deal with all the issues that effect
California, whereas the Fish and Game Commission deals directly
with our marine resources.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) is the most significant advance in fisheries management
in nearly a half a century.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the law's other benefits:
</P>
<P>
   Provides a scientific peer review process for fishery-management
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Requires that the Fish and Game Commission adopt such a plan for
white seabass by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Assures interim nearshore rockfish fishery standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer will the state stand aside while important fisheries
_ public trust resources _ are experiencing dramatic declines,''
said assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), author of the
Marine Life Management Act. ``This is good news for the health of
the marine environment and good news for the coastal economy.''

   The saying holds true for many aspects of the cycling industry,
especially when one considers that even before 1900 bikes featured
multispeed drivetrains, had full suspensions and were being made
from materials considered advanced by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Motorized bicycles are nothing new, either. However, a unique
product sits on the horizon, one that is popular for commuting and
recreation for seniors and also brings together the downscaling of
electronics and the refinement of lightweight motors and energy
sources. Industry insiders believe the new breed of electric
bicycle will energize retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric bicycle is the next big thing in cycling. It's
just a matter of time,'' said Jeffrey Neale, manager of the I.
Martin Imports bike shop in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many reasons to believe that the use of a motor
will draw more people to recreational biking, there are those who
hold lofty notions that electric bikes will eventually ease the
problem of congestion and other urban traffic ills.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena cyclist Lorna Moore is among the electric-bike
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my neighborhood, when I go to the store in the afternoon,
traffic is just unbelievable,'' said Moore, 39, founder of Eminent
Reclaim, a grassroots organization that seeks to ``reclaim our
independence from the automobile.'' ``With my (electric bike), I
can just ride right up and go right past everyone waiting for a
parking space.''
</P>
<P>
   She initially purchased her electric bike so she could combine
exercise with practicality. Soon she realized she could get around
with more fun and less effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a jogger for 20 years,'' Moore said, ``I just sort of got
sick of exercising for exercise sake, you know _ jogging around the
block and then getting in the car and going someplace. With the
(electric bike), I can exercise and get my errands done at the same
time. I go to the bank, the market, my (post office) box, the
pharmacy, all over town, and it's really easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycling enthusiasts might ask what makes an electric bike
different than a moped.
</P>
<P>
   Because the electric bike's top speed is 20 miles per hour and
its weight is under 100 pounds, it does not qualify as a motorized
vehicle under federal Department of Transportation standards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to a recently passed state law, the vehicle
code's basic definition of a bicycle will not have to be altered to
allow for the electric bike. This proves critical to the bicycle
industry, because it permits companies to manufacture and import
electric bikes without having to meet the more stringent codes of
the Department of Transportation. It's also good news for the
consumer because no special licensing or registration is required,
although laws governing bicycle use apply.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of electric bikes is that they are considered
``power assist'' vehicles, meaning that the motor only engages when
there is power being delivered to the pedals via the rider's gams.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say what, if any, impact the electric bike
will have on the transportation landscape. Clean air standards
might well play a part in its success, with cities having to reduce
auto emissions or risk losing highway funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the electric bicycle will help bridge the gap to the
electric car and will make commuting by bicycle more accepted
overall,'' said Chris Martin of Charger Bicycles, which produces
the motor and energy unit for the GT electric bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Electric bikes are available in limited quantities from several
major bicycle companies, including GT, Trek and Giant, with more on
the way from Schwinn, Raleigh and others. The products are sleek,
sophisticated, easy to ride and expensive ($1,200 to $1,400).
Manufacturers take cues from their counterparts in Asia and Europe,
where bicycles are treated with considerably more reverence and
where sales figures of electric two-wheelers are already up into
the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Some electric bikes employ bolt-on engines with a friction wheel
that rotates against the rear tire to drive the wheel. Others have
motors that are actually housed within the rear hub, so
retrofitting your bike can be as easy as replacing the back wheel.
All are far from mainstream acceptance here, however, being lumped
in with those few ``weirdos'' who actually ride their bikes to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But bully for the the U.S. bicycle industry, which has seized
upon the electric power-assist bicycle as the product that will
lead it out of a market that has been declining ever since the tail
end of the mountain-bike boom of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage to electric bicycles is getting cars off the
road, and the Chatsworth Bike Stop is helping to do just that. In
addition to being a full-service bike shop and rental service, it
also is an information center for bicycle commuting. Located at the
MetroLink station, a fleet of six electric bikes is available free
of charge _ but fully charged! _ to any Metro Link pass holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding to work increases work energy level and decreases
driving stress,'' said Bike Stop manager Devon Archer, 28, of
Canoga Park. ``It also helps the environment.''

PADRES TOP BRAVES IN EXTRA INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves staged an improbable rally for a
ninth-inning run off San Diego's usually implacable closer, Trevor
Hoffman, to send Game 1 of the National League Championship Series
into extra innings. But with one swing in the top of the 10th on
Thursday morning, Ken Caminiti made sure that the Padres would keep
intact their two-and-a-half-year streak of never losing a game in
which they carried the lead into the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Half an inning after the Braves had scratched out a run off
Hoffman, Caminiti launched a one-out homer to left-center field off
reliever Kerry Lightenberg to break a 2-2 tie. After closing out
the Braves in the bottom of the 10th despite allowing two walks,
including one to the pitcher Tom Glavine, who was pinch-hitting
because the Braves had run out of position players, the Padres had
a 3-2 victory to open the series. Donne Wall relieved Hoffman to
record the final out, an Andres Galarraga fly ball to deep center.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Brown scheduled to start Game 2 here on Thursday
night, San Diego has a chance to take a 2-0 lead over the heavily
favored Braves before the four-of-seven-game series heads to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against Atlanta coming up with a ninth-inning comeback
were nothing short of astronomical. That's how good the Padres'
bullpen has been over the last two and a half years. But Hoffman
could not close out a Game 1 victory for Andy Ashby. Instead, the
Braves tied the game on a one-out sacrifice fly from Andruw Jones.
And so it was up to Caminiti to prolong the Padres' streak.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ninth-inning fireworks, it seemed that the game's
decisive play would feature Ruben Rivera's daring base-running on a
45-foot Baltimore chop by another ex-Yankee, Jim Leyritz.
Pinch-hitting for Wally Joyner with one out and Rivera on third
base in the top of the eighth inning of a 1-1 ball game, Leyritz
chopped a pitch from Dennis Martinez to the shortstop side of the
pitcher's mound. Martinez looked Rivera back to third before
tossing to first for what looked to be an easy out.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera broke for home as soon as Martinez threw to first.
Galarraga came off the bag early to throw home, but bounced his
throw past catcher Javy Lopez as Rivera scored the tie-breaking
run.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera had led off the eighth by doubling to left-center off the
Atlanta starter, John Smoltz, and advanced to third on Caminiti's
line out off the Atlanta left-hander John Rocker. On that play,
Rivera barely beat Jones' bullet from center and overslid the bag
at third. But instead of reapplying the tag, Chipper Jones chose to
show the ball to third-base umpire Greg Bonin as Rivera crawled
back to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The game began after a a 2-hour, 1-minute rain delay, and huge
sections of the upper deck remained unpopulated, which hid the fact
that the game was not sold out anyway. The announced attendance of
42,117 at Turner Field was about 8,000 seats shy of a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think going in it's going to be a tightly pitched
affair,'' Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox had said before the series.
And, when the series finally began, neither Game 1 starter did
anything to change anybody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Smoltz pitched his way out of a mess of his own
making in the top of the first. Smoltz walked San Diego's leadoff
hitter, Quilvio Veras, on a full count. With Veras running on a 2-1
pitch to Tony Gwynn, Smoltz fielded a comebacker but short-armed
his throw to second. The ball skipped past shortstop Walt Weiss and
into the outfield. Veras scampered to third, and the Padres had
runners on first and third with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn followed with another comebacker as Gwynn took second and
Veras held at third on the inning's first out. But, with runners
now on second and third, Smoltz caught Caminiti looking at a 1-2
fastball, then induced Joyner into a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The game was still scoreless in the top of the third when Andruw
Jones golfed a breaking pitch from Ashby, the San Diego starter,
over the left-field fence for a leadoff home run to give the Braves
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smoltz was having trouble with his control. He
allowed a bloop single to right to Carlos Hernandez to open the San
Diego fifth. But after catching Chris Gomez looking at a called
third strike, Ashby sacrificed Hernandez to second and Smoltz
walked Veras on a full-count pitch.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Cox had been asked how to contain the San Diego
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep them off base in front of Tony Gwynn,'' Cox said.
``That's what Hank Aaron said this morning. So that's good enough
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the 8-time National League batting champion, who batted .321
at the age of 38 this season, was coming to the plate with the
tying run in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   On Smoltz's first offering, Gwynn lined a run-scoring single
over short for his second hit of the game to tie the score at 1-1.
Smoltz fell behind Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 homers this season, on
the first pitch. Vaughn drilled Smoltz's next pitch to deep right
field, and only a sensational play by Tucker, who reached over his
head to make the catch one step before crashing face first into the
fence, temporarily saved Atlanta. &QL;

YANKEES ARE RULED OUT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They still may go down as authors of the greatest
season ever, but while Wednesday night's detour from immortality
will be blamed on an umpire's call, the New York Yankees also must
hold one of their own accountable for ignoring a lesson first
learned in Little League:
</P>
<P>
   Don't argue a play while it's still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, blinded by his horror
that plate umpire Ted Hendry didn't call Cleveland's Travis Fryman
out for running inside the first-base line after his 12th-inning
bunt, failed to retrieve the ball, which had trickled no more than
30 feet behind him after Tino Martinez's throw struck Fryman in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   While Knoblauch pointed and pleaded his case with the umpires,
pinch runner Enrique Wilson first sprinted, then staggered home
with the go-ahead run all the way from first while Fryman made it
to third, from where he eventually scored on Kenny Lofton's two-run
single that capped underdog Cleveland's 4-1 win over the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no clean sweep through the playoffs for the
Yankees, who had eliminated Texas in three straight and whipped the
Indians in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series before
losing an extra-inning postseason game in Yankee Stadium for the
first time since Game 5 of the 1964 World Series. This
best-of-seven series is now tied, 1-1, and headed for three games
in Cleveland as certainly as Wilson and Fryman circled the bases
while Knoblauch struck a pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea where the ball was to begin with,'' Knoblauch
said, ``and I expected (Fryman) to be called out. It was so loud,
so crazy, there was no question in my mind (that he was out).''
</P>
<P>
   But while Knoblauch chose to debate the issue on the spot,
Fryman spotted his chance to flee a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd keep running until somebody told me to stop,''
said Fryman, who had been asked to attempt a sacrifice just one
other time this season by manager Mike Hargrove and didn't get that
bunt down because he was hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman's last successful sacrifice had come on Aug. 25, 1996 _
338 games and 1,300 at-bats ago _ but Hargrove asked the third
baseman to try again after Jim Thome led off the 12th with a single
off Jeff Nelson, one of five Yankee pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   This time Fryman laid down a beauty just inside the first-base
line, then sprinted past the ball on the grass as first baseman
Tino Martinez charged in to make the play. Fryman was clearly
running inside the first-base line all the way to the bag, ignoring
the 3-foot ``runner's channel'' that spans the last 45 feet to the
base and is marked by an additional line on the edge of the infield
dirt in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he reached the base, Martinez's throw struck Fryman
between the numbers. First base umpire John Shulock made a ``safe''
signal as Fryman crossed the bag, and while Knoblauch had a nutty,
rookie Wilson made a madcap dash around the bases that ended with
him stumbling the last 30 feet to the plate, just beating
Knoblauch's afterthought of a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, watching from the visitors' dugout on the third-base
side, said he paid no heed to the Knoblauch summit meeting with the
men in blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the ball roll free,'' Hargrove said, ``I picked up
our lead runner, Wilson, and tried to help him stand up. I thought
we'd have to get a wheelbarrow out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians now had a lead in what had begun as a wonderful
pitchers' duel between Charles Nagy (who left after 6 2/3 innings
when the Yankees tied it, 1-1, on Scott Brosius's double) and David
Cone (who went eight innings, allowing only David Justice's home
run in the fourth), then turned into a tense standoff between
bullpens. Soon they would have an insurmountable one.
</P>
<P>
   But first, more talk: Hendry explained to an incredulous Yankees
manager Joe Torre that Fryman was not guilty of interference
because he was entitled to the bag, the throw did not strike him
until he was already there, and he had not impeded Martinez's
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on the grass, it was so blatant,'' Torre said. ``I
don't know what to say. It was a terrible call.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, umpiring crew chief Jim Evans _ yes, the same
man who was Jimy Williams's nemesis all season _ launched into an
elaborate explanation of the rule, though when asked point-blank if
his colleague had made the right call, he seemed to hedge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he was right on the base, the fact that he was
at the base, makes it a very tough judgment call for the plate
umpire,'' Evans said. ``I thought the call could have gone either
way. But I think it was a proper call probably in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians parlayed Fryman's presence at third into two
insurance runs. Sandy Alomar was hit by a pitch, Joey Cora walked,
and Lofton, hitless in nine previous at-bats in the series, lined a
bases-loaded single to left, scoring Alomar and Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton was cut down trying to advance to second, but no matter.
The Yankees, 1 for 12 Wednesday night with runners in scoring
position, went down meekly in the bottom of the inning against
Indians closer Mike Jackson, who saved three games against the Red
Sox in the AL Division Series and picked up his fourth of the
postseason Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland's a good team,'' Torre said, ``but you'd have liked
to have them beat us clean. They got the other base hit to make it
4-1, but you've got to have better umpiring than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves a bad taste and it's bad for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's bad for baseball isn't necessarily bad for the
Indians. Hargrove, while demurring that he didn't watch Fryman's
path to first, said he thought the umpires made the right call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to belittle that play, the importance of that
play,'' Hargrove said, ``but honest to goodness, we don't care how
we got the win as long as it's ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, meanwhile, said he was ``dumbfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a no-doubter,'' he said. ``When you play four
hours out there and it's decided that way, it's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of dumbfounded, really. It was a mistake, maybe. I
don't know. I reacted to the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre readily acknowledged that Knoblauch's reaction was the
wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the replay,'' he said. ``He was yelling at the
umpire. You can't do that. You've got to make the play, then argue
the call. I think he was just so shocked that (Hendry) didn't make
the call.''

SATURDAY IS OPENING OF SEASONS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saturday marks the regional opening of deer-,
bear- and waterfowl- hunting seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Duck shooters will target their favorite sites across most of
the state, including the Southern California and Southern San
Joaquin Valley waterfowl zones. The Colorado River Zone opens
Friday. (The Northeastern California Zone kicked off Oct. 3.)
</P>
<P>
   The most popular Southland locales are San Jacinto Wildlife
Area, (909) 654-0580, and Imperial Wildlife Area, (760) 359-0577,
where water coverage is spread well and should attract large
numbers of quackers.
</P>
<P>
   Five deer zones are opening in a range that includes Los
Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties, Northern Ventura
County and parts of Kern, Riverside and San Diego counties.
</P>
<P>
   Deer are scattered throughout the San Bernardino Mountains due
to ample grass and other forage, and the general advice is to scour
off-road sites normally not scouted. ``Walk someplace you have
never been before,'' said Jim Davis, a Department of Fish and Game
associate wildlife biologist in Big Bear Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation to bear hunters is to get out soon. The zones
that encompass L.A. County, Northern Ventura County and
Southwestern San Bernardino County are among the latest to open in
the state, and biologists anticipate an early closure.
</P>
<P>
   Bear season is slated to end Dec. 27, unless the state kill
quota of 1,500 is reached before then. As of Wednesday, 294 bears
had been shot statewide in zones already open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is there are more and more bear out there, including
in Southern California, where they are expanding their natural
range from the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains,'' said
Doug Updike, senior wildlife biologist with the DFG's Wildlife
Management Division in Sacramento. ``It appears to be tracking last
season, in that it we're looking at an early closure.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information, consult the DFG's hunting-regulation
handbooks for waterfowl and for mammals and furbearers, or call the
department's Long Beach office at (562) 590-5126. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hold off on those Yankees-Braves World Series wagers.
The Yankees are no guarantee to get out of the American League. And
the San Diego Padres have something to say about which is the best
team in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   They refused to be intimidated Wednesday night by the team with
the best record in the league, earning a 3-2, 10-inning victory at
Turner Field in the rain-delayed opener of the best-of-seven NL
Championship Series on Ken Caminiti's homer off Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the 10th, Caminiti victimized rookie closer
Ligtenberg with a shot over the fence in left-center field and took
San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman off the hook after he'd allowed the
tying run in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, this was a duel between the starters.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Andy Ashby gave up a home run to Andruw Jones in the
third inning, but that was his only lapse. The Padres tied the game
on a run-scoring single by Tony Gwynn with two out in the fifth
against the winningest pitcher in postseason history, John Smoltz,
and went ahead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who has won 11 postseason games, ran out of gas after
throwing 117 pitches. Ruben Rivera led off the eighth with a double
to left-center. Lefthander John Rocker was called in to face
Caminiti, who lined to right. After the catch, Rivera reached
third, but not without controversy. The throw from Andruw Jones
beat him to the bag. But he was called safe on a close play by
umpire Greg Bonin, even though it appeared he had slid past the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz, the former Red Sox malcontent and current
postseason poster boy, was sent up to pinch hit for Wally Joyner.
Leyritz had become something of a cult figure with three homers in
the NL Division Series against Houston, but this time he barely got
the ball off his bat. No matter _ it did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   His chopper between the mound and third was grabbed by ancient
reliever Dennis Martinez. The 43-year-old veteran didn't look the
runner back and threw to first _ while Rivera came barreling to the
plate. Andres Galarraga first dropped Martinez's throw, then made a
hurried throw that skipped past catcher Javy Lopez, and the Padres
had the edge. Briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was done after seven innings, and Hoffman, author of 53
saves in 54 chances during the regular season, was brought in as
the third pitcher in the eighth, stranding a runner at second.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves got to him in the ninth after he struck out
Galarraga on a 3-2 pitch. Ryan Klesko drew a walk, and when Javy
Lopez singled to left, Klesko slammed headfirst into third,
bloodying his nose in the process. Andruw Jones's fly to left
brought Klesko in with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   But then it was the turn of Atlanta's closer, Ligtenberg, to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of hours, it appeared that the Braves and Padres
would have to postpone their initial showdown. Rain delayed the
start 2 hours 1 minute, and by then, many of the tomahawk choppers
were headed home. Those who stayed saw Smoltz pitch his way into
and out of trouble as the Padres squandered an excellent scoring
chance in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Quilvio Veras led off the game with a walk and
moved to third on a throwing error by Smoltz. The Braves
righthander fielded a grounder by Gwynn and attempted to start a
double play. But his throw to second got past shortstop Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, however, is a master of escape in such situations. He
threw out the next hitter, Greg Vaughn, with Veras holding and
Gwynn moving to second. Caminiti struck out. And when Joyner
grounded harmlessly to first, Smoltz covering, he was out of the
inning unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego also had runners in the second and third but again had
nothing to show for it. Not so Atlanta, which began chipping away
at Ashby. In the third inning, leadoff batter Andruw Jones hit a
1-0 pitch into the left-field seats. Michael Tucker then doubled,
and Smoltz sacrificed him to third.
</P>
<P>
   But the rally fizzled. Braves manager Bobby Cox tried a suicide
squeeze, and it backfired as Weiss popped to the pitcher and Ashby
easily doubled Tucker off third, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves threatened again in the fourth as Keith Lockhart led
off with a double to the wall in right-center. But Chipper Jones
lined to left; Galarraga grounded to short, moving Lockhart to
third; and Ashby threw out Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Padre bats finally came to life in the fifth, when they tied the
score. And it took a sensational over-the-shoulder catch by Tucker
to save another two runs. Smoltz, who had breezed through the
previous inning, gave up a leadoff single to Carlos Hernandez. A
sacrifice bunt by Ashby put him in scoring position after Chris
Gomez struck out. But the second walk of the game, to Veras,
brought up Gwynn, who dumped an opposite-field single to left,
scoring Hernandez. Tucker took a sure double away from Vaughn with
a circus catch in right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The near miss was costly to San Diego. Vaughn suffered a
strained left quadriceps muscle while running and left the game in
favor of Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz pitched out of another jam in the sixth. With two out,
Steve Finley and Hernandez worked him for walks. But Smoltz made
Gomez his fourth strikeout victim.

FILMMAKER SAILS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Aboard the 38-foot sloop Klondike, future UCLA
filmmaker Ariane Compagnone was five days out of Horta in the Azore
Islands and five days from the Brittany coast of her native France
when the North Atlantic gale hit.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and rain pummeled Klondike's sloop. Twenty-five-foot seas
rocked the vessel, which was soaked by the cascades of cold water
coming into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper, a French motorcycle mechanic who kept Klondike's
engine the cleanest part of the boat, had ordered the one-man
watches increased to two-man, with a rotation of two hours on, two
off. Below decks, the wet clothing and foul-weather gear, damp
bedding and splayed paperbacks, bottles and dishes were swirling
around like the seas outside.
</P>
<P>
   But Klondike was taking the storm well. And visibility was
actually pretty decent . . . at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the waves picked the boat up, we were above the level of
the ocean and could see for miles,'' Compagnone said.
</P>
<P>
   When the boat slid back into the troughs, however, the crew
could see only enormous slabs of vertical water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been in the environment for a while,'' Compagnone said.
``The storm hit on our last leg of the journey. We had adjusted by
then.''
</P>
<P>
   She and a shipmate even made a game of trying to log the most
miles-made-good during their watches in the storm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compagnone has been sailing since she was 14 and, by 23, she has
crossed the Atlantic twice. Blame her parents. They shipped her off
kicking and screaming to sailing camp one summer. Guess she liked
it.
</P>
<P>
   Her other great passion _ filmmaking _ blossomed later, when she
learned to work a digital video camera. That's how she wound up in
four-year film program at UCLA. Maybe it was fated that she would
one day combine her two fancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I had a student shoot a documentary at sea,'' said
Marina Goldovskaya, a professor of film at UCLA and documentarian
of some renown in her native Russia. ``I think it is very unique,
not so much what she's filming but how she's living her life. I
would be terrified to do it. I was very worried about her. She left
and then called from different parts of France waiting for this
trip to happen. I said, `Look, Ariane, come back. I'm so worried.'
Then she disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week or two, she was in the middle of the Atlantic out of
range of coast-guard helicopters, fuel and drinking water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut away to 1994: By the two-week mark in Compagnone's first
Atlantic crossing, discipline had begun to fail. Three of the crew
squabbled in mid-ocean and then refused to speak to each other. The
cause: food. Some of the crew weren't willing to prepare the type
of meals the others expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``At sea, food is primary. When you have one crew member baking
cakes and oven dishes and being creative while another only boils
eggs, it creates friction,'' Compagnone said.
</P>
<P>
   The recalcitrant hands were fired in the Azores, but it forced a
10-day delay.
</P>
<P>
   Even when morale is good, crew diversions on the high seas are
limited. BBC radio can sometimes be raised on the short wave, card
games can be played, long novels read and watches talked away.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's dealing with the daily adversities, small and
large, of any long sea passage. Klondike's freshwater system was
giving the water an unpleasant aftertaste. The solution? Someone
poured a glass of Pastis, an anise-flavored liqueur, into the main
tank, which gave the water a pleasing zing from then on. Problem
solved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time Compagnone had shipped out on her second Atlantic
crossing, she had designs on a master's degree at the School of
Theater, Film and Television at UCLA. It was January 1998 _ the
winter of El Nino. In the four years since her first ordeal, she
was more versed in the ways of sailing and photography _ namely how
to operate the requisite digital video equipment for filming a
documentary at sea.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she spent 37 days sailing more than 4,000 miles as
crew aboard the 38-foot catamaran Corca from La Rochelle, France,
to Guadeloupe in the southeast Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   To prop up tourism and the French boating industry, the French
government gives tax breaks to boat owners who lease yachts to
charter firms on the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery of the boats is where blue-water sailors like Ariane
come in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patience was a virtue for the transoceanic sailor during the
winter of El Nino. The crew waited in La Rochelle, France, for a
four-day opening in the weather. Then they sat in port in La
Caruna, Spain, for another four days while a low-pressure system
passed. Later the crew waited in Funchal on the island of Madeira
for six days to let two more low-pressure systems pass.
</P>
<P>
   There was more waiting in Tenerife in the Canary Islands for
final provisioning. And then the open ocean, finally.
</P>
<P>
   The first 10 days were bitter cold with high seas and frazzled
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would wake up thinking we had capsized,'' she said. As the
passage progressed, conditions moderated. The crew wrestled aboard
a 44-pound tuna. Dolphins appeared.
</P>
<P>
   But that journey, too, was marred by a major crew problem,
resulting in the firing of the first mate.
</P>
<P>
   Also, between La Caruna and Madeira, the hull of a companion
vessel, a Lagoon 42 catamaran, was stove in by a tree trunk
floating just under the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the evening and the crew was preparing a show on VHS
for us. Suddenly, (begin ital)bam(end ital). They thought it was a
whale,'' said Compagnone. ``It made a hole in one of their hulls
but at a waterproof compartment. They were able to seal it off. Our
boat wasn't made that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corca made landfall on Guadeloupe on Feb. 27, and Compagnone
had 46 hours of raw footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have viewed the 46 hours three times and have already cut 26
hours,'' said Compagnone. She expects to have two versions complete
for a February exhibition on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Could the French Riviera be next for this nautical filmmaker?
Just call her a Cannes-do kind of girl. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Had the Astros won just four more regular-season games
and two more Division Series games, there would have been NLCS
baseball played at a reasonable hour Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston. Under glass.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, one more reason to be bitter about the events of the past
weekend in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening's two-hour rain delay was, in many ways,
inevitable, a function of the law of averages. The Braves have
played host to 39 playoff games in the 1990s, which must surely be
the major-league record for a single decade. None of them had been
postponed or, to my memory, even appreciably delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's still 1998, you know where the blame
rests.
</P>
<P>
   El Nio.
</P>
<P>
   But also, I think, on the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty storm system that wreaked soggy havoc on our inaugural
CART race Sunday afternoon is the same one that caused Game 1 of
the NLCS to be pushed back, waaay back, to the ungodly hour of
10:16 p.m. EDT. By the time of the first pitch, some of the beer
vendors were already drained of product. But because even heavier
rain is forecast for today, we had no choice other than to
patiently wait out the drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   A Friday doubleheader in lieu of a much-needed travel day _
Atlanta and San Diego are more than 4{ hours apart _ was a grim
option to contemplate considering that Game 3 will start at 1:15
p.m. on the West Coast on Saturday, as TV says it must.
</P>
<P>
   And what TV says goes. Remember that bizarre 48-hour break
between the two Astros-Padres games in Houston?
</P>
<P>
   I figured you might.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres clearly profited from said hiatus, getting to throw
Kevin Brown twice in three games and thereby mask their inferior
pitching depth. So there will be a definite poetic justice meted
out if San Diego ends up in a pitching pickle.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves can withstand almost any imaginable disruption save
for another pass-through by General Sherman. As things stand, if
the NLCS script goes according to their plan, they will be
hard-pressed to ever use their latest phenom, Kevin Millwood, who
won 17 games. Year after year, it seems, theirs remains an
embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Yet also the other, bad kind of embarrassment. Atlanta is a
franchise increasingly victimized by its inevitable regular-season
success in tandem with its predictable postseason shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Braves fans, as rabid a bunch of tomahawk choppers as could be
found six or seven autumns ago, have lost their edge. While the
chopping and chanting continues, you sense an underlying lack of
conviction, overtly manifested by the thousands of empty upper-deck
seats.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of participation in the NLCS and one piddling
World Series victory to show for it, the appeal of Turner Field's
high-altitude ``cheap'' seats at $45 per has dwindled
precipitously. You might not see every one of those tickets used _
or even sold _ until the Braves are nine innings shy of a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, though, the Braves won't admit they are rankled by the
apparently tepid interest in playoff matchups that have become
downright mundane. As Game 2 starter Tom Glavine said: ``Who are we
to say (Atlantans) should be spending their money on baseball
tickets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, you don't draw over 3 million fans without a lot of
support, and we were able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeit before the prices got jacked through the non-roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city is very excited,'' argues manager Bobby Cox.
`` The seats that are available they're not exactly the best in the
world. But we're still going to get 46,000 to 48,000 in here, if
not more, and that's a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But several thousand more, it turns out, than would purchase
tickets. Official paid attendance was 42,117, by far the smallest
Atlanta postseason crowd of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, an air of palpable anticipation was lacking in the
stadium. No doubt the long wait, the late hour and alcohol-dulled
senses contributed to the muted emotions, but you sensed a
been-there-done-that attitude among the many jaded, with good
reason, locals.
</P>
<P>
   In these parts, playoff ball has become only slightly more of an
event than, well, watching rain fall.
</P>
<P>
   And given how the interminable evening concluded, the rain was
about the best part. The Padres finagled a cheap go-ahead run in
the top of the eighth, endured Atlanta's battling back to tie the
score in the bottom of the ninth, then won it anyway 3-2 on Ken
Caminiti's home run in the top of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   For the 20,000 or so insomniac Atlantans dedicated enough to the
home team's increasingly quixotic cause to have hung on through
such a protracted, ultimately bitter end _ it finally came at 1:43
a.m. local time with two Braves stranded on base _ the cynicism and
ennui surely deepened.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how many will return tonight?

EXPERTS SAY 2 ATTACKERS KILLED GUATEMALAN BISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WALLACE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of U.S. forensic experts has concluded that at least two
attackers were responsible for the killing of Guatemalan Bishop
Juan Jose Gerardi _ a finding that undercuts the official
government explanation of the slaying as a ``crime of passion''
committed by a single suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The experts _ San Francisco private investigator Jack Palladino,
San Diego forensic dentist Norman Sperber and San Antonio deputy
medical examiner Robert Bux _ based their opinion on an examination
of the evidence collected by Guatemalan authorities after Gerardi
was bludgeoned to death April 26 and after an autopsy that was
conducted last month.
</P>
<P>
   After a careful review of the evidence, they concluded that the
official theory _ that Gerardi was slain by his assistant, the Rev.
Mario Orantes _ is simply not credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a crime of passion,'' Palladino said during an
interview this week from his San Francisco office. ``It is a
political crime. I don't say that because it is simply the more
likely explanation. I say it because it is the only possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi was killed two days after he oversaw the release of a
landmark report on war crimes committed by the military and rebels
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino, Bux and Guatemalan human rights officials have
planned a press conference in Washington Thursday to reveal
previously undisclosed information linking the Guatemalan military
to the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan authorities have concluded that Orantes, who lived
with Gerardi and discovered his body, beat the bishop to death with
a large piece of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   But Palladino said Bux, a forensic pathologist with 14 years of
experience who has performed more than 4,000 autopsies, concluded
that two different types of weapons were involved: the chunk of
blood-stained concrete recovered by police at the scene and a thin,
hard smooth object used to strike a powerful blow that fractured
the sockets of both of Gerardi's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The thin object has never been recovered and appears to have
been removed from the scene by Gerardi's killers. Palladino said
Bux's finding that two different weapons had been used to kill the
bishop makes it unlikely that only one person was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Gerardi's body had been moved during the
assault. The bishop was more than six feet tall and weighed 240
pounds, and the condition of his clothing indicates that he was
lifted physically off the ground by two people working together.
</P>
<P>
   In the official explanation of Gerardi's death, Guatemalan
authorities say that the bishop appeared to have been bitten by
Orantes' German shepherd, Baloo, who was sleeping beside the priest
on the night of the bishop's death.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sperber and Bux analyzed the dog's teeth and the wounds
on the bishop's face, and concluded that it was not possible that
the injuries were caused by a dog bite.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino, whose past investigations include a seven-year probe
into the mass murder-suicide of People's Temple members in Guyana,
said that the viciousness of the assault and the nature of the
injuries lead him to conclude that the bishop's death was
premeditated by two intruders, not a spur-of-the-moment attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were guys who knew what they wanted to do,'' he said.
``They wanted to kill him and they wanted to mutilate him.''

U.S. DEATH RATE FROM AIDS CUT IN HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    The death rate from AIDS in America, already declining steadily
in recent years, plummeted by nearly 50 percent last year to its
lowest in a decade, federal health officials reported Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a result, the disease no longer ranks among the nation's top
10 causes of death, and is now 14th, compared with 8th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists attributed the sharpest drop in the AIDS death toll
on record to the impact of a new family of drugs, called protease
inhibitors, that can virtually wipe out detectable levels of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS. The drugs have restored many infected
people to at least temporary good health.
</P>
<P>
   Increased use of condoms and other prevention efforts have also
played a significant role in the improving picture of the AIDS
epidemic in the United States _ although its ravages in Africa,
Asia and the nations of the former Soviet Union remain unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zingale, executive director of the national advocacy
group AIDS Action, called the news ``one of the most extraordinary
accomplishments in the 15-year fight against AIDS,'' and added:
``Just a few years ago, those diagnosed with AIDS received a
sentence to near-certain death. Today, despair has been transformed
into hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Among young U.S. adults in the most sexually active age group _
those between 25 and 44 _ AIDS-related illnesses were the leading
cause of death in 1995, but by 1997, they ranked fifth, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual preliminary estimate of deaths from all causes was
issued Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics. It
reported that AIDS-related illnesses killed a total of 16,685
Americans last year _ a striking 46.4 percent drop from the 31,130
AIDS deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that the nation's infant mortality rate
declined slightly last year to reach a new low of 7.1 deaths per
1,000 live births, while births to teenagers _ a long-standing
problem in the changing sexual behavior of young people _ fell by
an estimated 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report also estimated that national homicide rates dropped
by 12 percent last year, and there were significant declines in
deaths from firearm injuries, drug abuse and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of many other improvements in the nation's health,
life expectancy for people born in 1997 rose to a record high of
76.5, according to the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The three leading causes of death in America remained virtually
unchanged last year, the report said: heart disease, with an
estimated 725,790 deaths compared with 733,361 deaths in 1996;
cancer, with 537,390 deaths in 1997 and 539,533 the year before;
and strokes, with 159,877 deaths last year and 159,942 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 are chronic lung diseases, accidents,
pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, suicide, kidney disease and
bacterial blood infections.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the nation's statistics were the estimated
totals of births for the year. Preliminary estimates indicated
there were 3,894,970 births in the United States during 1997, only
a little more than the 3,891,494 babies born in 1996. Of the 1997
babies, 1,260,593 were born to unmarried women, a virtually
identical total to 1996.

CLINTON ASKS FOR VOTES OF CONSCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton made a final plea to lawmakers
Wednesday to cast ``a vote of principle and conscience'' on the eve
of Thursday's House vote, which is all but certain to authorize the
third impeachment inquiry in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to others to decide what happens to me, and ultimately
it's going to be up to the American people to make a clear
statement there,'' Clinton told reporters in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   With passage of a Republican resolution calling for an
open-ended inquiry considered inevitable, attention is focused on
how many Democrats will support a process that could lead to the
nation's first presidential impeachment since Andrew Johnson in
1868.
</P>
<P>
   Each Democratic defection will make it harder for the White
House to dismiss the procedure as a partisan witch-hunt. As of last
night, estimates of Democratic votes ranged from 10 to 60, with
Southern and moderate lawmakers regarded as most likely to join
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Among San Francisco Bay Area Democrats, only Rep. Ellen Tauscher
said she expects to vote in favor of the Republican version of the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said in an interview that she favors a Democratic
alternative that would set strict time limits and parameters on the
investigation. But if that measure fails, as expected, she intends
to vote for the GOP resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the only way to move this forward is to have an
inquiry initiated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment inquiry _ which could begin as soon as this
month _ would be the first since Watergate. In 1974, President
Richard Nixon resigned shortly after the House Judiciary Committee
approved articles of impeachment. The only other impeachment
proceedings against a president took place more than a hundred
years ago when the House voted to impeach Johnson. He was later
acquitted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings will be based on the evidence compiled by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who concluded that Clinton lied
under oath, obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses in an
effort to conceal an extramarital affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. Republicans have set an informal deadline
of New Year's Day but have kept open the possibility that the
inquiry might run longer or be expanded to include other matters,
such as Whitewater or campaign finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was caught in an awkward position of hoping
Democrats will vote against the resolution while trying to avoid
the appearance that it was trying to influence the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it is not proper for us . . . to aggressively
try to impact or lobby people on this,'' said White House Press
Secretary Joe Lockhart. ``While we understand the politics and the
political pressures, we hope (members will) do what they believe is
right for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had made about a dozen calls to
members of Congress on the matter and insisted that there has been
no horse-trading on legislation with those who offer their support
or threats against those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Hillary Rodham Clinton met with about 25
freshman Democrats and made the case that the procedure embraced by
Republicans _ based on the Watergate model used 24 years ago _ is
unfair. Vice President Al Gore has made about a dozen calls to
lawmakers to make a similar argument, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, including some who have sharply disagreed with
the president in the past, echoed the White House's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, of San Francisco, decried what she regards as
the inconsistencies between the heavy-handed, open inquiry into
Clinton and the discreet investigation into House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi noted that the same Republicans who voted for Gingrich as
their speaker after he lied under oath to a congressional committee
about his political practices are now seeking to impeach a
president for lying about a extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypocrisy is raging here,'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats urged a radically different approach and
suggested that Clinton give party members the go-ahead to support
the Republican plan. Since approval of the Republican resolution is
a foregone conclusion, some Democrats argue, the president should
eliminate what may become a damaging issue in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., told reporters that if the vote breaks
down along partisan lines, ``then the November election is likely
to be a referendum on the president's conduct.'' That, he added, is
not in the ``long-term best interests of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be in the best interest of Democrats, Moran said, if
the election turns on issues such as education, health care and the
future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also received a stern warning from Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., who said on the Senate floor: ``Don't tamper with
this jury.'' Senators would decide whether to convict Clinton and
remove him from office if the House approves articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher, a freshman, is the only Bay Area member for whom the
vote is expected to be an election issue. Her challenger, Charles
Ball, has questioned her close ties to the president and sought to
make Clinton's troubles an issue in the campaign. Wednesday,
Tauscher chastised Clinton's behavior as ``deplorable,
self-indulgent, reckless and just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that ``at this point, it is not clear to me that
those offenses rise to the level of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher faces a dilemma familiar to other Democrats. On the one
hand, they do not want to give Republicans a weapon that allows
them to bash a Democratic president for the next several months or
longer. At the same time, they do not want to appear to be letting
him off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a debate about whether (to investigate the
president), this is a debate about how it will it be done,'' said
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., ``The way the
Republicans are trying to do this is not right. It is a long,
extended, drawn-out fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats worked into the evening crafting an alternative, which
will likely be offered as an amendment to the Republican proposal.
Sources said the alternative would call for a firm December 31
deadline and would confine the investigation to matters covered in
the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure has almost no chance of passing, it could
provide a way for Democrats who vote against the Republican
resolution while still going on the record with their support for
an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, however, said she will vote against
both alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't condone President Clinton's behavior,'' Lee said.
``But I know the country wants us to move forward and work on the
issues, such as eduction, a patient's bill of rights and the
environment.''

LIVERMORE LAB SAYS BARRIER WILL STOP TRUCK-  BOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    Engineers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said
Wednesday that they have successfully tested what they called a
``terrorist vehicle barrier'' that twice destroyed trucks loaded
with 400 pounds of sand to simulate a death-dealing load of high
explosives.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The barrier, made of two concrete blocks and 10 steel pipes
linked by a necklace of one-inch steel cables, was the brainchild
of Willard H. Wattenburg, a consultant to the weapons laboratory,
who is known for his often off-beat concepts that have actually
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The test Wednesday was the second conducted at the Department of
Energy's nuclear weapons test site 65 miles north of Las Vegas, and
its apparent success led Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to
declare in a statement: ``This innovative terrorist vehicle
barrier, refined and tested by scientists . . . has the potential
for saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept was seen as an inexpensive and easily deployed way
to protect American embassies or troop encampments in nations where
terrorism is likely.
</P>
<P>
   But David B. McCallen, the project's chief investigator,
conceded in a telephone interview Wednesday that the destruction of
a terrorist's load of explosives could well destroy any buildings
near a protected embassy and kill any residents in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``That potentiality,'' McCallen said, ``would have to be
reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   To McCallen and Wattenburg, a structure like the barrier they
tested would be most useful when deployed in a locale like the U.S.
military housing compound near Dharhan, Saudi Arabia, where a
terrorist truck bomb killed 23 Americans and injured several
hundred others in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although the barrier they tested used 1,200-pound concrete
blocks as anchors to hold down the steel pipes, McCallen said the
anchors could easily be made of anything handy _ empty oil drums
filled with sand or water, for example, or even old vehicles ready
for the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very easy to construct this kind of barrier
anywhere,'' McCallen said. ``the concept is elegant in its
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of the two tests, on October 1, a small pickup
truck was driven by remote control at a speed of 36 miles an hour,
and when it hit the barrier it ran over the top for 50 feet,
resulting in a sheared engine, a severed transmission and a crushed
drive shaft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the vehicle was destroyed forever,''
McCallen said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's test involved a smaller barrier and a larger,
one-ton truck. This time, the loaded ``terrorist'' vehicle flipped
over on its roof and was totally disabled, McCallen said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Wattenburg's off-beat ideas, already in use, struck
him after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, when an overpass on the
Santa Monica freeway was destroyed. He invented a bridge made from
the beds of surplus railroad flatcars with columns and footings
built with segments cut from the cars with torches.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, when a flood wiped out two overpasses on
Interstate 5 near Coalinga, Caltrans crews constructed two of
Wattenburg's temporary bridges within two days. Later, when
permanent structures were completed, the crews took Wattenburg's
bridges apart and stored them in kit form in a Caltrans warehouse,
to be ready for other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of it,'' Wattenburg said at the time, ``is that you
can put the whole thing together like Lego blocks.'' &LR;

 &HT;    Speed means success for Bengals' Mack
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Being able to run fast is a valuable asset for a
kickoff return man, but it's just as important to know when to run
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you return kicks, you're just like a running back,'' said
Cincinnati's Tremain Mack. ``You wait for the blockers to do their
jobs, you read the holes and when the holes open, you take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack took off for a 97-yard TD in the Bengals' last game at
Baltimore and will be trying to add to his stats this Sunday when
the Bengals host Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who ranks fifth in the NFL with his 28.4-yard average,
said returning kicks doesn't involve much cerebral exercise. ``You
just catch the ball and run hard. If the hole opens up, you take
it. If it doesn't open up, you try to find another one. If that
doesn't work, you just try to get as many yards as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams captain Eric Bieniemy usually is Mack's lead
blocker. ``A good return is all about spacing and timing. The
return man has to be patient, he has to have a knack for knowing
when everything is set up and when to make his move. Tremain has
the knack.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack, the Bengals' fourth-round pick in the 1997 draft, set a
school record for kickoff return yards in a season with 514 as a
redshirt junior at Miami (Fla.).
</P>
<P>
   Mack had only 13 tries in '97, but had 39.5 yards per return.
``We had a really good defense and I didn't get many chances,'' he
said. ``I didn't get my first return until the sixth game.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been on the return team the previous season, but did
nothing but block and grow increasingly more frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next year, I kind of suggested at a meeting that if I
wasn't going to be the return guy, I didn't want to be on the
(return) team. The reason was that I was tired of blocking for guys
who weren't running as hard as I thought they should.''
</P>
<P>
   That memory has helped shape Mack's aggressive running style.
``I want the guys in front of me to know that I'm going to run hard
no matter how tired I am or what the circumstances are. That every
time I touch the ball, I think I'm going to score. When they know
that, they tend to block a little harder.''
</P>

   No Bengal has ever led the NFL or the AFC in kickoff returns.
Willie Shelby holds the club record with a 25.4-yard average in
1976.

 &HT;    U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship continues
 &HT;    By Bucky Albers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When he was a youngster growing up with 10
brothers and sisters in North Vernon, Ind., John Miller acquired
the nickname Spider because he was always crawling all over
everything.
</P>
<P>
   He is 48 years old now, but Spider Miller hasn't stopped
crawling. Miller, a beer distributor from Bloomington, Ind.,
crawled into the quarterfinal bracket of the U.S. Mid-Amateur
Championship on Tuesday with two more easy victories at NCR Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Five other former USGA champions weren't so fortunate. Danny
Yates, David Eger, Buddy Marucci, Jerry Courville and Buddy
Alexander were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Robert T. Jones Trophy will go to one of the
following eight _ Chip Holcombe, Danny Green, Paul Simson, Sean
Knapp, Randy Haag, Gary Wolstenholme, Steve Sheehan or Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan, medalist in the qualifier, had to go 24 holes to beat
Jeff Kern of Tucson, Ariz., who had won a 20-hole match with Yates
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Holcombe, 37, of Casselberry, Fla., birdied the 17th hole and
cut down the long-hitting Courville, who missed an eight-foot
birdie putt on the 18th. Haag of San Francisco, who has made it to
the Mid-Am quarterfinals three times, finally got to the semis by
beating Eger, 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Marucci lost a 2 and 1 decision to Green of Jackson, Tenn.,
runner-up in the 1989 U.S. Amateur, and Alexander lost, 2 and 1, to
Simson, 46, of Raleigh, N.C., two-time North-South Amateur champ.
</P>
<P>
   Wolstenholme of Great Britain rebounded from 4 down at the turn
to win three straight holes and score a 2-up victory over Michael
McCoy of Des Moines. Knapp, 36, of Oakmont, Pa., took a 4 and 3
victory over Bob Kearney of Houston, who had been red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has buried three opponents. He won, 5 and 4, in the first
two rounds and, 5-3, in the third over Clayton Uselton of
Tullahoma, Tenn. He is 9-under par in three matches covering 43
holes after going 4-under in the 36-hole qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   He is using the same 60-inch, Cobra Tricep putter he rode to the
1996 Mid-Am Championship at Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one that uses it,'' Miller said. ``That tells you
something, doesn't it.'' The putter was designed to go outside the
shoulder, but Miller runs the shaft through his armpit and out the
back, so he had to bend the shaft to correct the loft.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller brought the putter to the Masters last year, Fuzzy
Zoeller said it looked like a fireplace poker.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters invitation came with his Hartford victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played poorly but I had a great time,'' Miller said. ``Fuzzy
made it special for me. I played every (practice round) with him
and was fortunate enough to play with Arnold (Palmer), Jack
(Nicklaus) and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played Palmer and Nicklaus, Fuzzy said, `If we can't
beat these two old guys, we're playing (Gene) Sarazen and (Sam)
Snead tomorrow.' They kicked our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is surprisingly long off the tee for a guy with a
5-foot-9, 160-pound frame. ``That's because I work hard,'' he said.
``The other guys have these desk jobs. I'm out there lifting kegs
and loading trucks.''

 &HT;    LCRA water rights buy goes to state agency
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Austin and other cities near the Colorado River will
not need to search for new sources of water until 2090 if state
regulators approve a $75 million purchase of water rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Garwood Irrigation Co., which serves rice farmers near the
Gulf of Mexico, has agreed to sell its considerable water rights to
the Lower Colorado River Authorityfor the highest price in Texas
history.
</P>
<P>
   Before the LCRA can begin closing the deal, the sale needs
approval from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission _
and that could come at a commission meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do a jig in the street if we get this thing
wrapped up,'' said Mark Rose, general manager of the LCRA. ``If
it's approved, you can put a bow on it. I think we can have this
closed by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   How much water is at stake? Enough each year to cover one acre
to the depth of 25 miles. More importantly, it's enough water to
extend the LCRA's supply for cities and major industries to 2090 _
a crucial consideration in a fast-growing, drought-prone region.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to this point, however, has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Garwood and the LCRA had to overcome a half-century of
animosity over water charges that Garwood considered excessive and
over LCRA efforts to restrict the company's access to the river.
Then, the LCRA had to overcome protests from Austin, Lago Vista and
Lakeway. The cities objected to Garwood's decision to sell 20
percent of its water to Corpus Christi, which is well outside the
Colorado River basin.
</P>
<P>
   The Garwood rights are considered one of the state's top water
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood's water rights are the oldest on the Colorado River,
dating to a November 1900 state permit. Under state law, Garwood's
rights must be satisfied first _ even if an extended drought limits
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, water rights can be bought and sold like any
private property. Whoever buys the Garwood rights would stand first
in line for Colorado River water.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the value of the water rights is that Garwood forms
the largest block of privately held water on the Colorado River _
168,000 acre-feet a year, or almost 55 billion gallons. An
acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover an acre to a depth
of one foot, or about 326,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood has asked the three members of the state's Natural
Resource Conservation Commission to approve the sale of water
rights for 133,000 acre-feet a year to the LCRA and 35,000
acre-feet to Corpus Christi. The commission's executive director,
Jeff Saitas, has recommended approval.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA would pay $75 million for its share. To repay the debt,
the agency anticipates raising water rates 20 percent, beginning in
two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA operates Lake Travis and the other Highland Lakes,
releasing enough water through dams to satisfy downstream needs.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, enough water flows down the Colorado River to easily
meet the demand. That would change, however, during an extended
drought. And that is when owning senior water rights would begin to
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Garwood's 133,000 acre-feet would translate into slightly more
than 100,000 acre-feet of ``firm-yield'' water, or water that would
be available even during a repeat of the worst drought in Central
Texas history. That was during the early 1950s, when the level of
Lake Travis fell 67 feet below full. For comparison, during the
drought of 1996, Lake Travis dropped 29 feet below full.
</P>
<P>
   Even during a critical drought, Garwood would ensure enough
water to fill Town Lake 28 times and meet the household needs of
750,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Garwood rights are critical for the future of Austin as well
as southern Williamson County and northern Hays County, which will
increasingly rely on LCRA water.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the LCRA has 53,000 acre-feet left to sell in the
Highland Lakes; the Garwood purchase would triple the agency's
firm-yield reserves. Austin has been seeking to buy an additional
50,000 acre-feet of firm-yield water from the LCRA, for a total of
300,000 acre-feet _ enough to last until 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great deal for the region,'' Austin City Manager
Jesus Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Austin was considering a formal protest to
the conservation commission. The city contended that selling water
to Corpus Christi would short-change Austin by 1,500 acre-feet
during a repeat of the 1950s drought.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA agreed to provide additional water if the sale to
Corpus Christi ever affects Austin's water supply, and Austin
dropped its protest _ ending the last serious threat to the Garwood
agreement. Lago Vista and Lakeway had already decided not to pursue
their protests, although they remain concerned about piping water
outside the Colorado River basin.

 &HT;    Using credit cards recklessly shattered Len Rodriguez's life
 &HT;    WITH CREDIT-CARDS
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Five years ago, Len Rodriguez's life was
moving far too fast to allow even a glance at a credit-card balance
that was accelerating faster than his red Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Roses and limos for dates. Trips to New York and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing for me to go out dancing and spend $300,'' said
the former body-builder. ``All on the Visa.''
</P>
<P>
   The car was an essential part of his self-absorbed lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to impress everybody,'' he said. ``It was a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   With an income approaching $70,000, Rodriguez was certain he
could pay off his bills. Then his income took a sudden, sharp drop,
but the interest on his debt kept compounding.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Rodriguez is typical of problems faced by many
middle-income people who leave themselves nothing to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing saved,'' he said. ``I'd even borrowed on my
credit cards for the down payment on my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who won the title Mr. West Palm Beach, earned most of
his income as a personal trainer based in a Wellington gym. When he
moved to a gym that closed soon after, he was reduced to living on
his county lifeguard's salary of $24,000 while trying to pay off
more than $9,000 in credit-card debts.
</P>
<P>
   He kept up the payments on his house and car but couldn't
stretch to cover even the minimum on his credit cards. He began
ducking calls at home and work. He got friends to say he was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to lie,'' he said. ``It's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez checked into claims by several credit-restoration
companies but was put off by the fees and skeptical of their
claims. ``It sounded crazy that I should pay them on top of
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was impressed by Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a
nonprofit agency. He contributed the cost of postage (about $4 a
month), and, in return, the agency negotiated with his creditors
for lower payments. With his minimum reduced to $250 from more than
$400, Rodriguez took extra jobs to begin chipping at the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to look for things in my field so I could use this
as an opportunity to get ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time lifeguard duty on Miami Beach meant several 140-mile
round trips each week but also gave him a boost in experience that
allowed him to move from pool to beach duty in his regular job.
That gives him a better shot at advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also filled off-hours and weekends with a variety of
other jobs, including hotel valet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to do anything crazy or illegal,'' he said. ``I
believe the way to pay your bills is to work.''
</P>
<P>
   He made enough progress by last year to marry the woman he'd
courted with all those limos and roses. Last week, he got the first
credit report in four years showing his credit cards have been paid
in full.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to trade in the Corvette for a family car and has
no plans to go back to gym work, even though it would pay well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a drug addict who's been through rehab,'' he said.
``I need a different environment.''
</P>
<P>
   LEN RODRIGUEZ'S STORY: HOW DEBT TRAPPED HIM
</P>
<P>
   At 36, he was a lifeguard and personal trainer with an income
near $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then: He bought a Corvette for $613 a month, plus $149 for
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a townhouse that cost $550 a month for mortgage and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   He took $4,000 in cash advances on his credit cards for the down
payment.
</P>
<P>
   He charged about $5,000 for trips, dinners and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When he changed jobs and went to work for a gym that soon
closed, Rodriguez lost two-thirds of his income. He didn't want to
lose his house or car, but he stopped making the minimum payments
of more than $400 a month on his credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   He also owed more than $1,000 to a department store, which won a
court judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to pay part of his debts, Rodriguez stopped
answering his phone and got friends to lie to creditors.
</P>
<P>
   AND HOW HE ESCAPED
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Palm Beach County
negotiated lower payments with the credit card companies. Rodriguez
gave the agency $250 a month to pay his credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   He and his counselor tore up his cards and canceled the accounts
to avoid deeper debt.
</P>
<P>
   His counselor showed him how to make and live within a household
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez changed his lifestyle. He cut out the trips and
dinners and took on several part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Working weekends and holidays for four years, he gradually
increased his monthly payments and is now free of credit card debt
and up to date on other loans.

 &HT;    Debt eating away at credit-happy consumers
 &HT;    WITH CREDIT-SIDE
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Buy now, pay never.
</P>
<P>
   That's how more Americans than ever think _ if they think at all
_ when they pay with plastic. It's one of the big reasons we set
records for personal bankruptcies three years in a row, and why
Congress is determined to stop the streak.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been filled with talk about a nation of deadbeats
that seems to contradict widespread elation over a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be an anomaly, but it isn't,'' said Samuel
Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute, a
research organization. ``The same consumer spending that helps
drive and sustain the economy is putting families into debt.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just poor families. A new survey by the American Bankers
Association found that 45 percent of credit-card holders with
incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 never pay off their balances.
</P>
<P>
   Many others don't even make the minimum payments and fall behind
on the interest. Debt counseling services across the country are
seeing more middle-to-upper-income clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to see people who were in debt for a small amount of
money: $20,000 or $30,000,'' said Jean Brannan of Consumer Credit
Counseling Service of Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.
``Now, we have people with over $100,000 in credit-card debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who are already in debt are being bombarded with
credit-card offers, and most have been conditioned to think of
spending as something akin to a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem really is that a lot of people are just getting
by,'' said Gerri Detweiler, author of The Ultimate Credit Handbook
and several other books on personal finances. ``Even if they're
making good money, they're not prepared for anything happening
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything includes divorce, corporate cutbacks, business
setbacks, major medical expenses _ common hazards of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have five or six cards with a balance on each, and
they're not really paying attention to anything except the minimum
monthly payment,'' Detweiler said. ``Then, all of a sudden, they
don't have the same income, and it throws them into a financial
tailspin.''
</P>
<P>
   If that has you punching up your mental calculator, factor in
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a combination of lots of debt and not much
savings, you are a candidate right now for bankruptcy,'' Detweiler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tumble from prosperity is often hard, fast and startling.
Many people make the mistake of confusing available credit with
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit-card companies are in the business of selling money,''
Brannan said. ``They always want you to buy more.''
</P>
<P>
   Seductive credit offers have played a major part in the debate
over proposals to make it harder to file for bankruptcy. While
conceding that personal debt is an increasing problem, many
Democrats say lenders bear considerable responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Republican majorities passed personal bankruptcy bills in both
houses, although the Senate version passed last month isn't quite
as tough, and both versions backed away from early proposals to
give credit card debts the same priority as child support, Gerdano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions would force consumers to seek counseling and
negotiate settlements before asking for court protection, and
that's likely to be part of any compromise bill. It's a step many
people are already taking on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more people who still have good credit and aren't
behind on their bills,'' said Arne Nielsen, community outreach
specialist for Consumer Credit Counseling. ``That's why they're
alarmed: They're making payments every month, but their credit-card
balance isn't going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Minimum payments required by lenders barely chip at the
principal. A $1,000 credit card charge at 18 percent interest _
less than some department store accounts _ will take nine years to
pay off at $20 a month. Meanwhile, you'll pay about as much as you
borrowed in interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the time, people keep charging,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The rising monthly tide has encouraged many to pay off their
high-interest card debts by taking out home equity loans, which are
often tax deductible. One survey showed $26 billion of credit-card
debts have been paid off that way in the past two years, but 70
percent of those card holders immediately started charging again.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a dangerous strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't pay your credit-card bill, the worst that will
happen is they'll call and send you a letter,'' said author
Detweiler, who is also education adviser to the Internet-based Debt
Counselors of America. ``They're not going to throw you in jail. If
you can't pay a home equity loan, you can lose the roof over your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some encouraging news about debt: It isn't rising as
fast as it was a few years ago. Household debt is up about 6
percent this year, which is down from last year's 8 percent,
according to federal figures.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans are generally trying harder to be responsible. The
percentage of cardholders who pay their balances in full each month
is up from 29 percent in 1992 to 42 percent, while the percentage
who fail to make even minimum payments is down to 3.28 from 3.69 at
this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only 41 percent of households say they spend less than
their income, according the American Bankers Association, and 15
percent spend more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people still look on credit cards as supplementary
income,'' Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no profile of the modern debtor. Men are
considered less likely to worry about money and security and more
likely to show off, but the spending impulse is nearly gender
equal.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely, however, to be caught short by divorce,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're often shocked to find out they're still responsible
for debts no matter what the divorce decree says,'' Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the least vulnerable are older people who grew up with a
pay-as-you-go ethic and never fell into the plastic habit. Among
the most vulnerable are young people, who are now deluged with
credit-card offers in college but who haven't been taught how to
use credit wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone could benefit from a moment's hesitation before
making a charge, Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn how to make plastic feel like money,''
Brannan said. ``We need to feel the same pain of separation when we
take it out of our wallets.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ If Dante Hall turns out to be the
answer to all the questions surrounding Texas A&AMP;M's hit-and-miss
offense, it's all right with him.
</P>
<P>
   If the Aggies' offensive success hinges on the diminutive Hall
carrying the ball a career-high 36 times, like he did last week at
Kansas, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty, 50, whatever. It doesn't matter to me,'' the Aggies'
junior running back said. ``I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can continue duplicating what he did to the Jayhawks,
he'll get it. Hall's 36 carries, exceeding his previous career high
by 14, translated into 177 rushing yards _ 7 fewer than his career
best against Texas Tech as a freshman in 1996. A&AMP;M needed all that
Hall had to offer to rally for a 24-21 victory, and his role this
week against second-ranked Nebraska probably won't be lessened,
even if his carries are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say he can't do it,'' Aggies coach R.C. Slocum said of
another 36-carry day. ``But it would be a real challenge to do that
against a team like Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' offense has faced a series of challenges all season,
though. A new and relatively untested line, the suspension of
fullback D'Andre Hardeman and Branndon Stewart's struggles at
quarterback are all factors leading to A&AMP;M being ranked last in the
Big 12 in total offense at 279.4 yards per game. A&AMP;M has been
desperately looking for an offensive cornerstone, and Hall is ready
to be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I've been wanting,'' he said. ``I want the
pressure put on me. I couldn't ask for anything better.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear to be a heavy burden on some relatively small
shoulders. Hall stands only 5 feet 8 inches, and while he packs a
solid 190 pounds on his frame and is hiccup quick, he is also
injury prone. The Kansas game was the first this season he has
played at full health after nursing shoulder and knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to carry the ball a lot for us to be successful,
but we'll need to be a lot more balanced against Nebraska,'' said
newly promoted A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown. ``We climbed on
Dante's back last week and he carried us, but he'll need help.
Nobody can do it alone.'' Added offensive coordinator Steve
Kragthorpe: ``We have to be careful. We want to get him into a
rhythm, but we don't want to get him beat up. A lot of it depends
on who's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, whose team-high 433 rushing yards rank eighth in the Big
12, is not the Aggies' only weapon at tailback. Sirr Parker, who
also has been nagged by injuries, is capable, although he has
managed only 119 yards on 42 carries.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M historically has tried to balance carries between backs, but
Hall, who has rushed for 2,048 career yards to rank 12th in school
history, is ready to buck tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it ever!'' he exclaimed loudly when asked if his unusually
high number of carries at Kansas is a change of philosophy. ``I
don't know why we've changed, or how long it will last, but I'm not
complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES _ Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe hasn't recovered
from a partially torn knee ligament and backup Eric Crouch has a
hip pointer, Coach Frank Solich said. Solich said Newcombe and
Crouch will dress for practice this week but their participation
will be restricted. The goal for now, Solich said, is simply
restoring both to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Aggies' 1939 national championship team will
receive commemorative championship rings and be introduced at
halftime of Saturday's game. Among the members of that team are
Austin resident Harold Cowley, who played at Freer High School, and
Wimberley's James N. Thomason, a Brownwood High product. A total of
64 rings will be presented _ 26 to surviving members of the 11-0
team that beat Tulane in the Sugar Bowl, and the remainder to
family members of deceased players and coaches.

 &HT;    UT's Leaks paved a path for Williams
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ever since he had the privilege to shake the
hand of Doak Walker and soak up all the genuine humility and
dignity that was the late great Southern Methodist running back,
Ricky Williams has been in awe of the man for whom a stadium was
dubbed and for whom an award is annually presented.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was, quite simply, a hero to the University of Texas
running back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Williams was asked if he had ever come across
Roosevelt Leaks, the man whose school single-game rushing record he
shattered with 350 yards, he shook his head, and that's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever talked to him,'' Williams said Monday.
``I've seen him before, and I've seen pictures. I heard he was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaks was at Royal-Memorial Stadium Saturday night. For all but
the last couple of minutes, he was among the 70,681fans who
witnessed the best rushing performance by any Longhorns back since
Leaks ran through an SMU defense a full quarter of a century
earlier for a staggering 342 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks stayed long enough to see his mark fall but was ready to
leave by halftime, which says his stamina isn't what it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good for about a half,'' he said, laughing. ``The young
man can run the rock. I was decent, Earl Campbell was great and
then there's Ricky Williams. He's somewhere between (Walter)
Payton, Jim Brown and Earl. He has that kind of repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaks' memory of his own play misses the mark, although he says
friends still remind him he fumbled four times (and lost three)
that day in 1973 when he broke Aggie Bob Smith's conference record
of 297 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaks' place in history was already secured. This dignified,
45-year-old father of two (son Prentiss is a linebacker/running
back on Lanier High School's ninth-grade team) broke down defenders
but, more significant, he broke down many invisible barriers for
the UT football program. The University of Texas was one of the
last teams to include black players and had just one on its 1970
national championship team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Leaks became the first black All-America football
player at a school that has had 14 consensus All-Americans since
that year _ half of them African Americans, including Williams. As
the first black superstar at Texas, Leaks made it fashionable , or
at least acceptable, for people like Earl Campbell, Raymond
Clayborn and Johnnie Johnson to become Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Williams might never have considered Texas had it not been for
this proud, countrified kid who experienced vestiges of racism his
entire life and therefore was prepared for such obstacles in
Austin. The difficulties were pronounced enough, however, that
Leaks considered transferring to Stanford the summer before his
sophomore year. He said he was also irritated because he was listed
third string on a depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really mesh,'' Leaks says of a time when fans and
some of his own teammates had trouble accepting a black star. ``The
type of athlete who came here in the '70s was different. You had to
be tolerant and deal with the racism. I grew up in an atmosphere
where you didn't drink out of the same water fountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, on the other hand, found ready acceptance in a more
cosmopolitan city that has enthusiastically embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of that rushing record, though, these two Longhorns
will be linked for all time in a way that they already have been,
subconsciously, since Williams arrived from San Diego as a
tattooed, dreadlocked, reggae-music-loving man with little
knowledge of what preceded him here. The pair are more alike than
they are different.
</P>
<P>
   The styles of both were, if not identical, at least cut from the
same explosive, powerful mold. Like Williams, Leaks was a hot-shot
outfielder, hitting .350 as the leadoff hitter on Brenham's 1970
state baseball championship team. Like Williams, Leaks carried
himself with a quiet, largely unemotional demeanor, but Leaks was
painfully private. When then-UT assistant David McWilliams asked
Leaks if he would sign with the Longhorns, Leaks didn't speak. He
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Writers raved about Leaks' quickness, his upper-body strength
fashioned from his days on his parents' 60-acre ranch outside
Brenham, and the forward tilt he displayed as he ran. He, too, was
a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate, finishing third in 1973
behind Penn State running back John Cappelletti and Ohio State
offensive tackle John Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams, Leaks remained in school after his junior season,
although jumping early to the NFL wasn't an option. ``That wasn't
fashionable then,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That was the shame for Leaks, whose right kneecap was crushed
against a teammate's face mask in a spring practice. After major
reconstructive surgery, he defied medical convention that he would
need at least nine months' rehabilitation and returned in time for
Texas' 1974 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The injury stripped him of his 4.5-second time in the 40-yard
dash and cost him tons of money when the projected first-round
draft choice fell to a fifth-round pick by Baltimore with a signing
bonus of less than $20,000. He never ran for 100 yards in a game
during nine NFL seasons, never came close to a 1,000-yard season,
never made more than the $150,000 salary he was paid by Buffalo in
1983. But he got his college degree in 4 1/2 years, enjoys a
professional career in appraising land and managing properties, and
left a legacy that should not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   When Leaks arrived in Austin in 1971, he was one of two black
freshman players. Sitting in the stands Saturday night, he could
count 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday I was sitting behind some younger (black) players who
had their rings on, which said they had graduated,'' Leaks says.
``When I see blacks getting an opportunity for an education first,
by all means I'm proud.''

 &HT;    Et tu, Linda! Back stabbers are `most toxic of all terrors'
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Treat your friend as if he will one day be your enemy, and
your enemy as if he will one day be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Laberius, 105-43 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Although Linda Tripp didn't invent betrayal _ Pontius Pilate,
Brutus and Benedict Arnold beat her to the punch _ she certainly
excelled at it.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her deception (complete with wire and tapped phone),
Tripp doesn't deserve all the credit. Monica Lewinsky, after all,
played into her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp falls squarely into the category author Lillian Glass
calls the Smiling Two-Faced Backstabber, in her book, Toxic People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us find the Smiling Two-Faced Backstabber to be the
most toxic of all terrors,'' she writes. ``In fact, in Dante's
Inferno, the final circle of hell was reserved for perpetrators of
the most heinous sin of all _ betrayal.... These chameleon-like
people are scary, for they change depending on what you need to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. One minute Tripp chats about diets, haircuts and sex to
Lewinsky as if she's a sorority sister, despite their age
difference. Then, Tripp deals the mommy trump card because that's
what Lewinsky _ childishly confused and insecure, although she was
playing a grown-up game _ needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel entirely too maternal towards you,'' the older woman
said. ``When I yell at you, it's out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Linda, it's out of manipulation. Because while Tripp's
methods are textbook, so are her motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep inside, back stabbers resent you but don't have the guts
to confess that they are angry or upset or even envious,'' Glass
says.
</P>
<P>
   Another bull's-eye: Tripp had fallen out of favor with the
Clintons, was angry about being kicked out of the White House and
was most certainly jealous of Lewinsky's power to demand a new job.
Hoodwinking the younger woman meant taking control.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as George H. Green and Carolyn Cotter put it in Stop Being
Manipulated, ``Herein lies an irony. The person who is trying to
manipulate you views you as having greater power than she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. In reality, the intern had the upper hand, not the
Washington veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, however _ because of inexperience, naivete, just plain
lack of intelligence or a combination thereof _ didn't know this.
Instead, she allowed herself to be victimized, and it's easy to see
why: She craved approval. And assumed a position of weakness to
earn it.
</P>
<P>
   In Clare Booth Luce's 1936 play The Women, Luce satirizes five
ladies who lunch _ and gossip, connive and back stab all under the
guise of caring for one another. On one hand, they seek approval.
But on the other, they secretly despise each other for being so
needy.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lewinsky felt a boost when Tripp called her a
``Marilyn Monroe vixen'' who would eventually ``come home to an
opportunity to get together with (Clinton).'' But how was Lewinsky
to know what she heard wasn't really encouragement but instead an
egging-on that would backfire?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, regrettably, it's impossible to know because, as
Karen Lehrman writes in The Lipstick Proviso, ``There will always
be malicious women who backstab, who use `sisterhood' as a way to
be resentful, malicious and vindictive.''
</P>
<P>
   But, experts say, there are warning signs that deception _ and
possibly betrayal _ is at hand:
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator becomes almost giddy with power and energy while
the victim becomes depressed and more dependent.
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator elicits personal details from the victim without
revealing any of her own, creating an imbalance in the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator preys on the fact that she shares a common bond
with the victim. (In the case of Tripp and Lewinsky, that would be
employment in the White House.)
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator _ because of the savvy that comes with age and
experience _ has a personal agenda, while the victim just wants to
``share'' or ``vent.''
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator shifts roles _ from empathizing buddy to
protective mother, for example _ to meet her own needs, not those
of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is, betrayal is a fact of life. But, as Riki Robbins
writes in Betrayed!, a victim's first step toward recovery is
forgiveness _ first for herself and then eventually for the person
who tricked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betrayal means a loss of innocence, especially because it most
often happens to those who are most vulnerable,'' Robbins says.
``The lesson is not to be cynical, but never to reveal too much too
soon. With diligence and faith, the betrayed can learn to trust
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires opening yourself up enough to return to the school
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Monica Lewinsky has learned some hard lessons.

 &HT;    In memorandum of the Indians
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Writing an obituary for the Cleveland Indians this
morning wouldn't be prudent, despite a tempting inclination to do
just that after watching the New York Yankees perpetrate something
close to aggravated manslaughter in front of millions of TV
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty, Mighty Yankees not only won their 118th game this
season, tying the all-time one-season record, they put an
exclamation point behind it when their first four hitters singled
against precocious Indians starter Jaret Wright and sent him
seeking the shampoo and soap in the shower before TV showed its
first commercial.
</P>
<P>
   When Game 1 of the 1998 American League Championship Series
ended, it was New York 7, Cleveland 2.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to the Indians, they have the Yankees right where
they want them _ the Indians with their backs plastered firmly
against the Yankee Stadium wall.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat Tuesday was Cleveland's eighth straight in the first
game of a postseason series, dating back to 1995. And in four of
those previous seven, the Tribe came back to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   And now they have to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Escape From New York for Wright. The Yankees were
peeking around a building from a back alley waiting on this guy.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't like the 22-year-old's perceived cockiness after he
beat them twice in last year's Division Series, after he put
together a 4-1 career record against them and especially after he
broke infielder Luis Sojo's left wrist with a spring training pitch
which they feel was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the night in June when he hit former
Cincinnati outfielder Paul O'Neill and when O'Neill expressed
displeasure, Wright motioned for O'Neill to shut his mouth and walk
to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's night Tuesday consisted of eight hitters and the
Yankees pecked him to oblivion with five singles and a walk en
route to five runs. The first four Yankees singled _ Chuck
Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, O'Neill (for a retribution run) and Bernie
Williams (for another run).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first inning ended, Chad Ogea was pitching, the
Yankees had a 5-0 lead and had batted around (10 hitters). Nothing
new there. The Yankees batted around an unfathomable 36 times
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   When Wright walked off the mound, with the Beatles' Help
accompanying his long walk to the dugout, the 57,138 fans booed
heartily.
</P>
<P>
   Five runs in the first inning was more than David ``Boomer''
Wells needed. With his baggy uniform making him look a guy wearing
pajamas after an all-night party, Wells put the Tribe to sleep with
no harm done _ two runs on Manny Ramirez's two-run homer run in the
ninth, five hits, one walk, one hit batsman, seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Wells not only marches to the beat of a different drummer, he is
the drummer. His back is covered with tattoos, he wears his
baseball shirt unbuttoned nearly to his navel, he wanted to wear
Babe Ruth's retired No. 3 when he came to the Yankees and teammate
Tino Martinez said, ``Our pitches come from all over. We have a
pitcher from Cuba, a pitcher from Japan, a pitcher from Panama and
we have Boomer Wells, who is from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this 35-year-old Martian was 18-4 for the Yankees this
season, shut out the Texas Rangers, 2-0 on five hits over eight
innings in Game 1 of the Division Series and shut down the Indians
without a run for eighth innings on in Game 1 of the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, in the postseason he is out of this world _ 6-1 as
a starter with a 2.48 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati fans remember Wells from the 1995 season when he
helped pitch the Reds to the National League Championship Series
against Atlanta _ then was traded after the season to Baltimore for
outfielders Curtis Goodwin and Travis Valdez _ a deal almost as bad
as the one that sent O'Neill from the Reds to the Yankees after the
1992 season for Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who completed his sixth straight season of hitting .300
or higher for the Yankees, had two hits, drove in a run and scored
two.

 &HT;    We're bewitched: `Charmed' is charming
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WB wants you under its spell. And they're using three
cute-looking witches to do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed,'' the network's delightfully bewitching new series,
tells the story of three sisters who find out they're witches with
really cool powers. Of course the sisters _ and their powers _ are
nothing alike. Prue (Beverly Hills 90210's Shannon Doherty) is the
hard-driving sister who can move objects with her mind. Piper
(``Picket Fences' '' Holly Marie Combs) is the down-to-earth sister
who can stop time. Phoebe (``Melrose Place'' 's Alyssa Milano) is
the free-spirit sister who can see the future.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they're a supernatural version of Charlie's Angels.
Instead of fighting crooks, our lovely trio battles all kinds of
evil forces. Don't laugh ... that Charlie's Angels comparison isn't
a stretch. Aaron Spelling, who produced that jiggly cop show, also
produces ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Charmed'' plays like a special effects-laden
morality play about good and evil. Three witches _ good. Mean,
witch-killing warlocks _ evil.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects _ what the kid viewers really care about _
are of Buffy the Vampire Slayer-like quality. There's a lot of
swirling light and good-looking warlocks turning into
not-so-good-looking killers. The dialogue, though, isn't as hip or
in-the-know as Buffy. But that's OK. ``Charmed'' is still funny,
spooky and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   We'd fall under the spells of these three witches any day.

 &HT;    UT needs more money from state, president says
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In his first major speech since becoming
University of Texas president, Larry Faulkner recently shared his
vision for the future and spotlighted a four-point plan to make ``a
university of the first class'' even better:
</P>
<P>
   Strengthen undergraduate education. Make UT-Austin the nation's
expert on Latin America. Get more involved in public schools. Forge
alliances with the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   And, on top of all that, do a better job in every endeavor, from
teaching to research to service, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us make this place more than a university of the first
class,'' he told several hundred faculty, staff, students, regents
and others at a ceremony to celebrate UT's 115th birthday and his
nearly six-month-old administration. ``Let's take it to the head of
the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Decked in an academic robe and tasseled, beret-style hat,
Faulkner's upbeat assessment that UT has the potential to be the
nation's best public university was tempered by his concerns about
state aid to higher education. The state provides 25 percent of
UT's overall budget, with the rest coming from tuition, fees,
private donations, grants and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have reached the inner circle of leading public
universities, but that does not mean that we are able to compete on
equal footing,'' said Faulkner, whose speech received a standing
ovation. ``Some state universities have funded their services and
achievements with strong state support, while others have used high
tuition and fees. UT, on the other hand, operates with relative low
state support and low tuition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although lawmakers significantly boosted aid to higher education
in last year's legislative session, UT's spending per student is
just 70 percent of what the flagship universities in California,
Wisconsin and Illinois spend, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   UT also ranks below its peers in spending on libraries, start-up
money for new faculty and salaries for graduate students, faculty
and staff, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend and predecessor, Robert Berdahl, cited similar
financial worries when he decided to leave UT last year to become
chancellor at the University of California at Berkeley. Berdahl
repeated his concerns Monday night at Texas A&AMP;M University in a
speech on the future of flagship universities.
</P>
<P>
   While state aid is a problem, Faulkner said, UT can do a better
job of managing its resources. He challenged all campus leaders to
evaluate how they spend money and make wise choices.
</P>
<P>
   UT has suffered in the national rankings because it has huge
classes and because too many students fail to graduate. A student
at a symposium to discuss UT's future earlier Tuesday said large
class sizes are a major impediment to learning.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said it was clearly time for UT to pay more attention
to undergraduate education, especially at the freshman and
sophomore levels, where large classes rule.
</P>
<P>
   The undergraduate experience is so important, he said, because
it ``influences learning, our sense of community, student
retention, institutional loyalty, our reputation among prospective
students and their parents, alumni giving, and, of course, our
ability to achieve our purpose of transforming lives
beneficially.''
</P>
<P>
   Student Government President Annie Holand and others at the
symposium said UT needs to become more caring and nurturing of
students. Holand said she was disappointed that of the hundreds who
attend the symposium, just a handful were students.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner also challenged UT to become the nation's premier
center for teaching about Latin America and educating its students.
Hispanics are expected to outnumber whites in Texas within three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner also said UT must support the high-tech industry to
sustain its growth. Members of Austin's high-tech firms have long
been critical of UT. Of particular concern is a lack of degree
programs at night.
</P>
<P>
   UT has begun to expand the number of engineering and other
scientific courses it offers on evenings and weekends, but Faulkner
said, along with educating technology workers, UT must be willing
to develop partnerships with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the university must pay attention to those at
the other end of the pipeline: public school students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of 300,000 18-year-olds in Texas, 130,000 did not graduate from
high school, ``a stunning and sobering statistic,'' he said.
Faulkner did not offer a solution but said UT must ``find ways . .
. to improve the performance of the educational system by reaching
millions of students, millions of parents and tens of thousands of
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, Morton Meyerson, a UT alumnus who heads 2M
Companies Inc. in Dallas, said if UT fails to do that, ``we might
as well not worry about higher education.''

 &HT;    Praises flow for chevre product in small dairy
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRIPPING SPRINGS, Texas _ Amelia Sweethardt turns on a faucet.
Out gushes a stream of goats' milk that four days hence will become
award-winning cheese. Call it the pride of Karrot, Angel, Apple,
Megan and others in the small goat herd that earned their oats last
month when Pure Luck Grade A Dairy walked away with four awards at
the American Cheese Society's annual competition in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Amelia's mom, Sara Bolton _ goat farmer, dairy owner and primary
cheese-maker _ was quite surprised: ``When I went to Wisconsin, I
didn't know my cheese was so good. I knew I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the dozen pros who judged the ``blind'' (unlabeled)
competition of 320 entries made by 77 artisan cheese-makers in the
United States and Canada. Comments from the judges' score sheets on
her cheeses read: very clean, creamy, fresh, beautiful, smooth,
good color . . .
</P>
<P>
   There are 150 to 200 goat-cheese makers in the United States.
Some of them have been producing artisan cheeses for 20 years, says
Laura Jacobs-Welch, administrator of the American Cheese Society.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '90s, the specialty cheese industry has gained
much momentum, she notes, and the goat-cheese makers probably were
the instigators of this popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Although a newcomer to commercial cheese-making, Sara ``did very
well'' in the competition, Jacobs-Welch says. But, she notes, that
it is not necessarily unusual for a cheese-maker to win multiple
awards once he or she hits that certain level of quality and enters
several categories.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Luck has hit that level. Sara says she only entered six
categories. She placed in four.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on the wall in the dairy is a second-place ribbon for
her chevre in farmstead cheeses, as well as another red for
producing the second best cheese of all chevres in the country. In
addition, her Del Cielo, a soft ripened cheese similar to
Camembert, tied for first in farmstead cheese and also won third in
all soft-ripened cheeses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for a small Hays County farmer who named her
Del Cielo cheese after a Joe Ely song on the ``Letter to Laredo''
CD. Ely is good company in the early morning hours of a dairy, Sara
says of the demanding life of a cheese-maker who raises goats.
</P>
<P>
   She explains that the ``farmstead `` cheese label means you
produce your own milk. ``A very small percentage of cheese-makers
in the U.S. are stupid enough to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sane cheese-makers, she continues, don't milk goats, cows or
sheep twice a day to get the raw product for their cheeses; they
buy the milk.
</P>
<P>
   Sara, however, has a soft spot in her heart for her goats. A
goat farmer for 20 years, she names them, talks to them, pets them.
In fact, she confesses, ``goats are my first love, over
cheese-making.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband Denny have raised their four children, ages
23 to 9, on raw goat milk. Fifteen of those years she made goat
cheese for her family. Then she bootlegged, producing cheese at
home and selling it to a few folks. About three years ago she
officially went commercial, establishing Pure Luck Grade A Goat
Dairy across the road from the Bolton s' house and organic
herb/flower farm.
</P>
<P>
   Every Monday she and her family/helpers make cheeses in the
small red metal building. They empty the refrigerated holding tank,
in which the 110 or so gallons from her 14 American alpine and
Nubian milking goats have been stored for the week, and pasteurize
the milk. A freeze-dried culture (bacteria) is added to change the
milk sugar to an acid and give the cheese its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turn on the faucet of the pasteurizer and fill
4-gallon plastic tubs with the milk. Rennet, an enzyme, is stirred
in to help the milk coagulate, the amount varying with the type of
cheese. Within hours the milk forms a large block called a curd,
which is the texture of soft Jell-O.It is ready for cutting or
scooping when a finger dipped into the curd causes it to break
cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal week, Pure Luck makes 100 pounds of chevre (fresh
goat cheese), 10 pounds of Del Cielo, 24 pounds of feta, 4 to 8
pounds of Claire de Lune (a semi-firm ripened cheese), and 4 to 8
pounds of Ste. Maure (a creamy mold-ripened log-shaped cheese).
</P>
<P>
   For chevre, the curd is scooped into molds. Instead of
traditional chevre molds, Sara substitutes ricotta baskets, which
makes a drier chevre with a pretty shape and size. It sells for
about $4.50 for about 5 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   For feta, she takes a long spatula , cutting the coagulated
block of curd into half-inch squares both vertically and
horizontally. Most cheese-makers have vats and a stainless steel
wire curd cutter to do this step, which releases the whey and makes
a drier cheese. Sara's simple, inexpensive technique employs
plastic tubs and long spatulas. Another contrast of little
cheese-maker vs. big one.
</P>
<P>
   She cuts the Del Cielo cheese curd similar to the feta and then
stirs it occasionally for 45 minutes to release more whey. After
scooping it into molds, she flips it several times as it drains for
24 hours. Then it is removed from the mold, salted and inoculated
with Penicillium candidum and ripened for 10 to 14 days. The
finished product is a creamy, soft round cheese, covered with a
white ``bloom'' or mold, completely edible. It sells for about $7
for a half-pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to do more Del Cielo, but the molds are $10 a
piece,'' she says . Goat-cheese making is not a cheap operation.
</P>
<P>
   It takes eight goats to produce as much milk as a cow, says Bud
Larsen of Larsen Farm Inc., a fellow Hays County goat-cheese maker
and one of five in Texas. Larsen, who produces about 1,200 pounds
of goat cheese a week, has kind words to say about his competitor:
``Several of us around here have put the Austin Hill Country on the
state map for goat cheeses; Sara Bolton has just put us on the
national map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara is a real connected to her animals and her process. She's
a true nature girl. She's staying small to put out an excellent
product. I think it's an excellent operation in all respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara says most dairies are larger than hers, but, ``I'm just as
big as I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If the dairy were the Boltons' only livelihood, she says she
would have to increase in size. And she admits she's toyed with the
idea but decided against it. The dairy is labor-intensive, even
with good longtime help.
</P>
<P>
   She and her family have other financial interests. They farm
eight acres of certified organic flowers and herbs, which they
sell, along with their cheeses, on Saturdays at a farm stand at
their home on Martin Road and at the Westlake Farmers' Market.
</P>
<P>
   Sara, dressed in faded shorts and shirt, apron and tennis shoes,
cuts cheese curds by hand in the dairy as she talks about life as a
small cheese-maker.
</P>
<P>
   However, conscious of food safety, she constantly checks
temperatures with a thermometer and adds chlorine to washing
solutions. The smell of chlorine permeates the room. ``Ninety-five
percent of cheese-making is sanitizing and washing,'' she says,
giving the romance of artisan cheese-making a heavy scoop of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Sara and her daughter Amelia, 21, work in tandem on tasks. Then
Sara stops to taste a Ste. Maure cheese, praising her daughter's
result, ``Umm. That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   A benefit of having a goat cheese dairy is getting your fill of
chevre. On Thursday evenings, dinner is cheese and crackers, says
Amelia. Along with a neighbor, she coats some of the cheeses in
herbs and spices and wraps the products for Friday distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Pure Luck Dairy keeps very little inventory. Almost as soon as
the cheese is completed, it is delivered by husband Denny, the
bookkeeper- marketer, to such places as Whole Foods Markets,
Central Market, Boggy Creek Farm, Kitchen Door on Lake Austin
Boulevard, Jeffrey's and Si Bon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best,'' Si Bon chef and owner Peter O'Brien says of
the Pure Luck cheese. ``Not only is it the best, but it's awesome
to have them this close. Plus Denny brings us fresh flowers and
fresh herbs. Sara and Denny are great people.''
</P>
<P>
   At his trendy restaurant, O'Brien incorporates the cheeses in
tarts and frittatas, on salads, as a spread on crostinis, in fondue
for lobster ravioli, or, in the case of Del Cielo, serves it by
itself with sun-dried cherries. It's goat cheese chic in the dining
scene of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Sara uses the goat cheeses in enchiladas, spanakopita,
lasagna and cheesecake, and on baguettes, focaccia and pizza. Just
family dinners at the Boltons, home of national award-winning goat
cheeses. Steps In making chevre: Milk goats Collect milk in a
holding tank Pasteurize milk Add freeze-dried culture (bacteria) to
change the milk sugar to an acid to give cheese flavor. Pour into
tubs Add rennet , an enzyme to make the milk coagulate and form
curd. Within hours the cheese forms a large block, called a curd,
about the texture of soft Jell-O. It is ready for scooping or
cutting when a finger dipped into the curd causes it to break
cleanly. Chevre is scooped into molds 12 to 18 hours after the
rennet has been added. ; Pure Luck uses a basket mold because it
makes a prettier shape and size. After draining for 24 hours, the
cheese is unmolded and salted. Salt preserves the cheese, brings
out the flavor and helps the cheese to continue to release whey.
After another 24 hours of draining, the chevre is packed plain or
herbed and packed. Two of Sara Bolton's favorite ways to use
chevre. Pesto Chevre Crostini 1 baguette
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces pesto, basil or sun-dried tomato
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces chevre
</P>
<P>
   Slice baguette into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick rounds and place on a
cookie sheet. Spread rounds with pesto. Spread chevre on top of
pesto. Bake in 350-degree oven 5-10 minutes or until chevre is
melted. Serve warm as an appetizer. Variation: Toasted baguette
rounds can be spread with basil pesto chevre and served unheated.
Roasted Veggie Chevre Sandwich
</P>
<P>
   1 baguette
</P>
<P>
   About 9 ounces chevre
</P>
<P>
   6 to 12 tablespoons pesto
</P>
<P>
   3 to 6 roasted red peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 roasted eggplant, scooped from skin
</P>
<P>
   Vertically slice baguette into three sections. Then slice each
section horizontally to make a sandwich. On bottom half of sandwich
spread pesto, using enough to moisten, 2 to 4 tablespoons. Spread
about 2 to 3 tablespoon chevre on top of the pesto. Top with 1 to 2
roasted red peppers per sandwich and roasted eggplant to taste.
Makes 3 sandwiches. Chevre: Pure, white goat's milk cheese, which
can range from moist and creamy to dry or semi-firm. Shapes include
discs, pyramids, logs. May be plain or coated in herbs, spices or
ash. Beyond the basic fresh chevre, the more than 20 varieties
include bleu, Brie and Cheddars. Curd: The semisolid formed when
milk coagulates. Rennet: An enzyme added to milk to make it
coagulate in cheese production. Whey: The watery liquid that forms
when milk coagulates. The eating and freezing of chevre
</P>
<P>
   Fresh chevre can be used like cream cheese or ricotta.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh chevre usually keeps up to two weeks, sometimes more. If
it gets too old, it tends to go sour and is not as tasty.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh chevre can be frozen, although it tends to be a little
more crumbly after thawing. (Aged goat cheeses, on the other hand,
do not freeze well because it kills the aging process.)
</P>
<P>
   For a goat cheese with a natural rind, like a Brie or the Del
Cielo, wrap it in waxed paper and then put it in a plastic bag so
it will not dry out. Use within a week.

 &HT;    South Korea finds lessons and hope in Olympic legacy
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Kate Wiltrout
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Lee Jae-hong looks out of his 12th-floor
office and sees the city of Seoul encroaching. It is gray as far as
the eye can see, a vista drenched in concrete. Traffic crawls
across the dirty Han River; helicopters buzz the urban skyline.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the building, perched on a corner of
sprawling Olympic Park, the view is lush and languid. Mothers push
baby carriages through rolling green hills; old men stroll pathways
between fountains and through a sculpture garden filled with works
of internationally acclaimed artists. A few brides and grooms pose
in front of a man-made lake for wedding portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two scenes tells the short version of
what has happened in South Korea in the decade since it hosted the
1988 Seoul Olympics. Atlanta hosted an Olympics before the city was
two centuries old. But for Korea, a country with thousands of years
of experiences, the Olympics are still revered by many as the
nation's greatest achievement and one of its most pivotal moments.
The 24th Olympiad was a seminal event in Korea's modern
development, coming between decades of dictatorship and newfound
democracy. It was a fast-developing nation's official debutante
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Korea tries to cope with major economic setback, it is
looking back to the Olympics to gauge both what went right and what
went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That experience could also have an impact on the future. With
Japan, South Korea will host the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament,
an event rivaling the Olympics in world attention. It also is
interested in hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics and has ``very
high'' chances, Olympic czar Juan Antonio Samaranch said during a
recent visit to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, secretary-general of the Seoul Peace Prize Committee, which
doles out awards with some of the money left over from the '88
Olympics, was intimately involved in South Korea's bid and
preparation for the Seoul games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a turning point in many fields _ political, economic,
social and cultural,'' he says. ``This was the first time we had
such a big international event since the founding of our country
4,000 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic legacy is a strong physical presence in Seoul. But
the Olympics also changed South Korea politically.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when dictator Chun Doo-hwan decided to bid
for the '88 Olympics, South Korea was a backwater to much of the
world. Almost 15 percent of its population lived in poverty. From
the rice paddies on which Lee's office now sits, you could see no
hint of the sprawl now dominating the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Chun, a brutal former general who unleashed soldiers on
pro-democracy demonstrators in the southern city of Kwangju in
1981, was wildly unpopular, but he hoped that hosting the Olympics
would distract attention from the bloody uprising. Far more than
Atlanta's winning the '96 bid, however, Seoul was considered a long
shot for the '88 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was anyone in Korea who had much
confidence,'' Lee said. ``We had an unstable economy and
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chung Ju-yung, founder of the massive Hyundai group and head
of the country's bid, went on the offensive, and South Korea took
the selection committee by surprise to win the '88 games.
</P>
<P>
   The government began massive infrastructure projects. Blueprints
became reality as the Olympic Expressway was built to connect the
city with Kimpo Airport, and the gyms and swimming pools that dot
Olympic Park began to rise.
</P>
<P>
   With the world spotlight on his country, Chun was unable to
crack down on demonstrators when the streets of Seoul filled in
June of 1987. Instead, he agreed to step down and allow democratic
elections in the fall. Roh Tae-woo, another general, was elected
president only when pro-democracy politicians Kim Young-sam and Kim
Dae-jung _ both destined to be future presidents _ split most of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, South Korea boomed as it readied for the Games.
Real GDP grew 11 percent a year in 1986, '87 and '88; inflation
dropped from 20-plus percent in the early '80s to the 3 percent
range. Massive apartment buildings went up to house a burgeoning
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Games opened Sept. 17, 1988, intense national
pride replaced performance anxiety, and the biggest Olympics to
date began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koreans are notorious for not observing rules, littering,
cutting in line. But in the stadiums, there was order,'' said Suh
Sang-mok, then-vice president of the Korea Development Institute,
an economic think tank. ``All of a sudden, we became citizens of an
advanced country.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Suh, an economist who studied the Games' impact, and Lee
have only positive memories of the Olympics. Yet both feel the
country lost precious momentum afterward. The main culprit:
National Assembly hearings into the Kwangju Massacre. The hearings
were cathartic for a newly democratic nation, but both men believe
the country lost a chance to forge ahead when it decided to look
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of ruined a very favorable domestic, future-oriented
atmosphere,'' Suh said of the televised hearings that began the
month after the Games. ``I think that's why the economy started to
get into trouble after the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give more concrete reasons for the economic collapse,
which forced Korea to seek a bailout from the International
Monetary Fund last December. The seeds of destruction, many
economists maintain, go back to the habit of government-directed
lending and reckless expansion of the massive conglomerates, or
chaebol, that powered Korea's advancement. With credit easy,
companies put little thought into their grand plans. In that way,
the dense urban jungle that now surrounds Olympic Park and
continues for miles out Lee's window is symbolic of what South
Korea got wrong in its development equation: It just didn't know
when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that recklessness may have resulted from the headiness
almost all South Koreans felt during the Olympics. Foreigners say
South Korea's pride in 1988 was almost palpable and, while that
pride might have been dented by today's economic crisis, South
Koreans continue to feel they can overcome obstacles when they are
united and determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the Games gave Korea confidence,'' Lee said.
``If we want to do something, with hard work and consensus from all
walks of life, it can be done.''

 &HT;    Horse whispering in Turkey
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVANOS, Turkey _ Ercihan Dilari sat coiled in the trim English
saddle, his black leather chaps pressed against the Arabian
stallion's ribs, and his worn cowboy boots anchored in the
stirrups.
</P>
<P>
   A rancher who grew up in the snow-topped volcanic mountains, his
eyes automatically scanned the ancient ghost cities chiseled by
hand into mountainsides and the towering red chimney peaks sculpted
by whipping winds.
</P>
<P>
   On this sub-freezing winter morning, the stallion raised his
head to scent the hard wind funneled through the canyon. His
nostrils flared and he tossed his head as he danced in an impatient
trot.
</P>
<P>
   Dilari easily controlled him by his soothing voice. No spurs, no
whip, no heels digging in the stallion's sides. Just leather gloves
firmly on the reins and a soft ``ssssssss'' to keep him in check.
</P>
<P>
   Dilari suddenly turned in the saddle to look back at me over his
shoulder. He grinned. ``Let's gallop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a signal like a big smooch, and the stallion bolted like
a spark from flint.
</P>
<P>
   Given rein, my black and white Arabian horse Sevda (in Turkish
it means ``desperate love'') was close behind, her unshod hooves
sinking in the soft mud, her neck stretched out, her head high.
</P>
<P>
   She was 900 pounds of churning muscle, sweating and blowing like
her ancestors who raced through here on the Silk Road, the ancient
trade route linking China and the West.
</P>
<P>
   With an unreasonable combination of fine-boned fragility and
fierce power -- a ballerina with the strength of a linebacker --
Sevda's slim black legs scrambled up steep banks and easily leaped
a 6-foot wide ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The golden canyon walls were a blur and every twist in the trail
felt like a hairpin turn in a Grand Prix race.
</P>
<P>
   During four days together, usually spending most of the day in
the saddle, Dilari and I flew across wheat fields; slowly crossed
frozen gullies, the horses' hooves breaking the ice; and waded
through knee-deep brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we saw cities carved into mountains during Roman
times, shepherds shearing sheep in a canyon, a beautiful nomad from
Algeria who was traveling with two long-haired camels, and two men
in a pub who longed to meet American women.
</P>
<P>
   There's a saying in this part of Turkey that there are three
things that are important in life -- your horse, your gun and your
wife. Horses come first.
</P>
<P>
   On our first morning together, I was asking a lot of questions
as we rode the dusty cobblestone lanes of a small village.
</P>
<P>
   Dilari suddenly volunteered that he and his wife were separated.
</P>
<P>
   He left her, he said, because ``she talked too much.'' I talked
less the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But his horse, Serap (which means something along the lines of
unattainable fantasy in Turkish), kept up a steady conversation as
we rode, whinnying and flapping his lips -- but evidently it was
not too much. Dilari would never leave Serap.
</P>
<P>
   Using his and his partner Ali Karatas' ranch, Akhal-Teke, as a
base, we roamed through Cappadocia in south-central Turkey on
horseback, which was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The name Cappadocia means Land of Beautiful Horses, and horses,
especially the elegant and strong Arabians, have been here at least
since the Persians came from central Asia in 600-300 B.C. Stone
tablets show that the Hittites trained horses here for sport and
war as early as 1400 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Man arrived by horse, and wars were fought by mounted men -- the
Romans in 300 B.C., the Mongols in the 1200s, and the Ottomans, who
for 600 years had armies with horses. Here, they say you're born on
the horse and you die on the horse.
</P>
<P>
   Which probably would be OK with Dilari. He's had lots of hard
riding in these wild valleys, where big white sheep dogs wear
leather collars with 4-inch metal spikes to keep the wolves from
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is a man who takes horse medicine when he's
sick. And who shares his cup of hot tea with his horse.
</P>
<P>
   In the corrals of his ranch, next to the banks of the Red River
near Avanos, his horses followed him like big labrador retrievers.
When I rode next to Dilari, Sevda would occasionally lay her head
against his leg.
</P>
<P>
   In Cappadocia, the people have a spiritual connection with the
horse. Dilari and Karatas have trained more than 20 Arabian and
cross-Arabian horses from birth, and have three colts who are going
through the gentle two-year process.
</P>
<P>
   No horse on the ranch is ever sold. The men use no whips, no
spurs, no heavy hand, and they have contempt for those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by a wood-burning stove at a cafe in the village of
Goreme, Karatas _ Dilari's urbane counterpart, who wore a black and
white tweed topcoat and had a British accent _ spoke about his
horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who use whips do it because they want to train a horse
quickly. They don't care about horses. In Cappadocia, we still use
the horse to go to the fields _ they're good friends to us,'' he
said, with obvious feeling.
</P>
<P>
   And of those who say horses aren't smart, he said, ``Those
people are not smart. Horses have fine personalities. They get
frightened, they laugh, they sing. They love each other, and they
love people.''
</P>
<P>
   The training process is done, he said, ``with a lot of time and
a lot of affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Commands are verbal, although Dilari's stallion seemed to know
what Dilari wanted no matter what words he used.
</P>
<P>
   Sevda, too, kept a constant eloquent eye on me during our rides,
and it was so clear what she was thinking _ let's run, let's just
walk, do we really want to walk through this cold water?
</P>
<P>
   On our first day, Dilari and I rode to Cavusin, where men carved
homes, churches, monasteries and stables into the soft rock of the
mountainsides. Rooms were stacked as high as a 10-story building
inside the mountain. Vertical, 4-foot-wide tunnels with footholds,
connected the levels, which required some serious agility to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Built during Roman times, people lived in them as late as 30
years ago, Dilari said, until the government moved them out and
saved the cities for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, we came across shepherds shearing sheep in a
canyon, clipping the thick wool with big scissors. And we stopped
at a cafe in Goreme where we met a nomad from Algiers, her black
hair wrapped in a yellow scarf. She wore a flowing red skirt and
big, mud-caked black boots.
</P>
<P>
   She took us to see her two camels, odd creatures with foot-long
hair, stabled in a cave. She and her husband had walked more than
2,000 miles from Algeria through war zones with the camels to get
here. The camels were brothers, she said, and she hoped to find
them a mate.
</P>
<P>
   On another day, Dilari and I ambled beside the rushing Red
River, through stands of poplars and apple orchards, and villages
where children rushed out to say hello, and to a 13th-century
caravansary, an outpost on trade routes where caravans could rest
and have protection from robbers.
</P>
<P>
   When I wasn't on the horse, I rode in the warm comfort of the
ranch's BMW, although German engineering couldn't compete with
Sevda. Karatas took me to meet a dozen artists meticulously
hand-painting pottery at the 200-year-old Sirca shop in Avanos, and
we looked at antique and new kilims and carpets in Goreme.
</P>
<P>
   This area is known for the pottery created from the clay from
the Red River. The carpets, made by women in their homes in the
villages, are considered to be the most beautiful in the country,
and are also much less expensive than in Istanbul and in the resort
cities on the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities abound and a visitor would need at least a couple of
weeks to do them justice. We explored Ozkonak, one of the largest
of the 13 underground cities in the area, built in the seventh and
eighth centuries by Byzantines and capable of sheltering 60,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   And Karatas pointed out a timulus, a pyramid-shaped hill built
in 2,000 B.C. as a burial ground for an important person. There are
hundreds in the area. At the Church of St. Barbara, carved into a
mountain near Goreme, there were simple red designs from the
Iconoclastic period (726-842) and 11th-century frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   At night, we had dinners in village restaurants, where we
pointed to the dishes we wanted _ grilled eggplant, shish kebabs of
lamb and chicken, yogurt soup with mint _ and drank tea.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner was a chance to get to know Turkish people and topics
included America's use of Turkish bases to maintain the no-fly zone
over northern Iraq (Karatas approves); Turkey's new religious party
(troubling to the mostly secular Muslim majority); and Turkey's
exclusion from the European club. (Turkish people are proud that
they always have been and still are a crossroad between the Middle
East and Europe and not aligned with either.)
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Palm Pub in the village of Urgup, where I ran
across the two men who wanted to meet American women _ because
American women are friendly and open and ``not snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   We sat in wing-back chairs in front of a fireplace and they
intensely discussed what they should say if I put them in the
newspaper. I promised I would, so here goes (both men are in their
mid-20s, nice-looking and earnest): Ozgur Akilli, tall, dark hair,
is a musician; and Koray Avci, a blond with wire-rimmed glasses, is
a jeweler. Interested women who are not snobs should send letters
to them at Antikite Aziz Baba, Kayseri Caddesi, No. 28, 50400
Urgup, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   My last morning before I took the plane back to Istanbul, I got
to say goodbye to Sevda.
</P>
<P>
   Snow was falling, and she looked so pretty, her mane tangled and
her coat thick with winter hair. She looked at me and I could have
sworn she was sad that I was leaving. Or maybe it was relief she
wouldn't have this strange American woman on her back. I'll have to
ask Dilari to ask her.

 &HT;    Coming full circle in Central America's Belize
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND MAP
 &HT;    By Dudley P. Olsson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELIZE _ We live in a treehouse on an airstrip on a tropical
island in Central America. Well, it's not really a treehouse. It's
a wood-framed space atop an airplane hangar, with bamboo walls,
exposed beams and lots of shutters. The fact that I can almost
reach the coconuts outside my kitchen window qualifies it as a
treehouse. The neighbors on either side live in thatched-roof huts.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Elis, is a volunteer pilot for Wings of Hope, a U.S.
nonprofit that provides air ambulance service for the country of
Belize. It's a big change for us and our two young children. We
used to live in a colonial-style house in the suburbs of Jackson,
Miss., and my husband managed a packaging company.
</P>
<P>
   The flying part isn't altogether new. Elis has been a pilot and
</P>
<P>
   flight instructor for more than 10 years. When I was a reporter
for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he instructed at Stone
Mountain Airport in Georgia. Flight instructing doesn't pay much,
though, so Elis went back to school to get his MBA. Now, a decade
later, it seems life has come full-circle.
</P>
<P>
   As the sole Wings of Hope pilot here, Elis is on-call seven days
a week during daylight hours, when flights are allowed in Belize. A
typical mission involves picking up a patient in a remote area of
the country and transporting him or her to Belize City, where there
is a modern hospital. At first, he flew a Cessna 205, capable of
taking off and landing on short airfields, but now he is flying a
Piper Cherokee Six that is fitted with a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   I stay home with the kids, take phone calls and do the necessary
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, we had a case involving a small boy from our town
who had ingested poison. When I took the convulsing child, nearly
the same size as my youngest, into my arms so that the mother could
board the plane, I suddenly realized how vital our work is.
Fortunately, the child survived the incident.
</P>
<P>
   We receive a small stipend for food and personal items, and
Wings of Hope covers our housing and other basic living expenses.
For the first few weeks, we got around town on foot or bicycle _ a
challenge with the kids and the heat. So we used our personal funds
to buy a beat-up Yamaha golf cart. The seat covers are coming off
and the gas pedal sticks, but it has made life a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   There are no paved roads in San Pedro, where we live, unless you
count the runway, which between takeoffs and landings serves as a
pedestrian thoroughfare. Recently, I watched a man in a wheelchair
speeding down the asphalt, being pulled along by his dog on a
leash.
</P>
<P>
   Only believe a third of what you read in the newspapers in
Belize and half of what you see with your own eyes, a local
resident told me.
</P>
<P>
   And it's true. There is something mystical and unreal about this
place, with its brilliant rainbows and exotic plant and animal
life.
</P>
<P>
   The island, Ambergris Caye, is known as La Isla Bonita.
Twenty-five miles long, it is the largest of the 200 or more
islands scattered throughout Belizean waters. Just offshore lies
the Belize Barrier Reef, the longest reef formation in the Western
Hemisphere. In the last 25 years, the reef and its rich marine life
have helped to transform San Pedro from a small fishing village
into a thriving tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Belize to most people in the States, and they've either
visited themselves or know someone who has. My brother and his wife
honeymooned on the island last year.
</P>
<P>
   From our window, we watch the small commuter planes take-off and
land every half-hour. The sound of their engines revving up wakes
us at 6 o'clock each morning. At night, the mechanics work on the
engines, so it is the sound we hear going to bed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, a twin engine airplane from the States was parked
in front of our house. Drinking my coffee, I watched as four
Americans, two men and two women, climbed aboard for a day trip.
Later that evening we learned the plane had engine trouble
returning to the island. The pilot lost control, and they crashed
in the jungle. All four were killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The incident bothered me for days. I kept making Elis reassure
me again and again that he isn't taking any chances. He says the
flying doesn't scare him. He loves it, and he loves what he's
doing.
</P>
<P>
   I like it here, too, and for the kids, it's a vacation everyday.
We
</P>
<P>
   know we won't be in Belize forever, so we're enjoying it while
it lasts. Who wouldn't like living in a treehouse on an airstrip on
a tropical island in Central America?
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Will a foreign-born ever be president?
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Oct. 11, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not have been tongue-in-cheek when Czech President Vaclav
Havel suggested that since Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
being foreign-born, could not be president of the United States,
she ought to consider the presidency of her birthplace, the Czech
Republic. There, she is eligible to attain the highest office.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech magazine, The New Presence, already has editorialized
that it is not an absurd idea. Albright, while pleased by the
attention and honor, says she's not interested. ``I love being an
American,'' she is quoted in Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was written into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers
that only native-born Americans could be eligible for the
presidency. They also wrote into that document that no foreign-born
could be elected to the House of Representatives until that person
had been seven years a U.S. citizen, or to the Senate until after
being a citizen for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Constitutional Convention, 1787, there was
great concern about dual loyalties to the new country and to
England, which had just been separated, by force, from what became
the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many of the delegates to the Constitutional
Convention were foreign-born, from England, Scotland, Ireland, even
the West Indies. Alexander Hamilton, born on the Caribbean island
of Nevis, was a delegate to that convention. He served as George
Washington's first secretary of the treasury and his face is on the
$10 bill.
</P>
<P>
   While Hamilton did not oppose the constitutional restriction on
the presidency, he was in the forefront to minimize the time for
foreign-borns to be allowed to run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Through the more than two centuries of this nation's existence,
the issue of a change to that constitutional requirement has had no
swell of support. Indeed, even American-born candidates have been
scrutinized for any possibility of dual loyalty. When John F.
Kennedy ran for president in 1960, a significant issue of the
campaign was whether he, a Roman Catholic, would follow the dogmas
of the papal office over the needs of the United States. Until
Kennedy, no Roman Catholic ever was elected to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   There will come a day, however, when a challenge will be made to
the native-born stipulation. It may not be in the next few decades
but certainly it will come. The rights of immigrants have greatly
been improved in the latter half of this century, and I can see a
time when someone not born in this country, perhaps carried here
when he or she was but months old, would attempt to erase the
stipulation through a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful would require an outpouring of lobbying and
votes from naturalized foreign-borns as well as first-generation
Americans. In numbers, that is not beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost 10 percent of the
population is foreign-born; 25.8 million. Nearly one in three
already has achieved citizenship _ through more relaxed rules than
originally in place.
</P>
<P>
   While this is not the highest percentage of foreign-born
residents in the U.S. _ it was 13.2 percent in 1920 _ the numbers
are growing again. From a low of 5.4 percent in 1960, it has almost
doubled in three decades. And it continues to grow at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   With that growth in numbers and percentage comes a growth in
voting power. The foreign-born influence will grow well beyond the
handful of them presently in the House and Senate. Targeting the
presidency is not beyond expectation.
</P>
<P>
   While Madeleine Albright has a string of political and
constitutional constraints working against her _ female,
foreign-born, Jewish ancestry _ there will come a time when those
no longer will be considered bridles, and a movement will be
started to change the traditions, beliefs and rules.

 &HT;    Ex-GSU president sees security crisis rising from Russia's
turmoil
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ University of South Carolina President John Palms
traveled this week to Moscow and St. Petersburg, where he is
discussing the former Soviet Union's economic and political turmoil
with politicians, policymakers and business leaders. The
63-year-old former president of Georgia State University in Atlanta
is part of a delegation from the Institute for EastWest Studies, a
New York-based organization seeking to foster stability in central
and Eastern Europe. Palms is a physicist who serves as chairman of
the Institute for Defense Analyses, an advisory body to the U.S.
Defense Department. He talked to staff writer Chris Burritt on the
eve of his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the arena of nuclear relations, what is the biggest threat
to peace and safety now that the Cold War is over?
</P>
<P>
   A: What I am really concerned about is the security of the
materials that are being made available by the dismantling of the
Russians' nuclear arsenal. There are about 50,000 warheads that are
being dismantled, and there is a heck of a lot of uranium and
plutonium in about 100 sites in Russia that are not being
adequately protected.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is security lacking?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Russians no longer have the security systems they used to
have, the fences and the security guards. If 100 pounds of uranium
or plutonium disappears, it is easy to make a nuclear weapon if you
have that kind of material. You can make one like we did over
Nagasaki or Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How might terrorists carry out a threat?
</P>
<P>
   A: You could make a weapon ... smaller than a bowling ball. You
could blow something up, or you could blow it up in the desert and
tell the United States, ``Look, we have one of these planted
somewhere and we want this and that to happen. That is a very great
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the political and economic instability in Russia
heighten the threats?
</P>
<P>
   A: No question about it. You've got government workers who used
to preside over these installations that have not been paid. You
have outstanding nuclear physicists, who have not been paid, who
could certainly market their expertise to other countries or
terrorists or dissidents who do not like what the country is doing
right now.
</P>
<P>
   We owe it to ourselves to buy up all that material and get it
out of there. They need the dollars and we need the uranium to burn
in our reactors (to generate nuclear power.) Based on their
inventories, you are talking probably over a 10-year period about
$10 billion to $12 billion, which is a small part of the Defense
Department's budget. We are spending about $400 million a year and
have made commitments over the next 15 years. You could double that
and get rid of it in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What other roles should the United States play to stabilize
this situation?
</P>
<P>
   A: When Russia had a police state and a strong KGB, there was
such terror in the country that nobody dared do anything illegal.
But there is a whole different atmosphere. There is a free-spirit
entrepreneurship. Millions of people have their own businesses now.
</P>
<P>
   But you do not have that security enterprise around sensitive
facilities that you have in this country. They really need to
develop a security-minded culture in this new democracy. They need
these facilities secured, not just physically by fences and
electronics, but they need to train a security force that does not
operate by terror but by a good police force and security like we
have in other countries. We could help them do that.

 &HT;    Decision to set rates even lower was heartening
 &HT;    RESEND TO REPLACE KILLED ARTICLE, GEEWAX-COLUMN.
 &HT;    GEEWAX-COLUMN HAS BEEN KILLED. PLEASE USE RESEND-GEEWAX-COLUMN.
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman was livid. She called the newspaper repeatedly to talk
to anyone who would listen to her rant about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The vehemence of her outburst seemed peculiar, considering how
tame interest rates are today. In recent weeks, the rates on
business loans, home mortgages and consumer loans have been
drifting lower, leaving millions of Americans in better financial
condition.
</P>
<P>
   So why was this woman so cranky?
</P>
<P>
   Because she is retired and lives on the interest from bank
certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury securities. When interest
rates decline on loans, they also fall on her savings. Recently,
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 5 percent for the
first time in the issue's 21-year history. For retirees who
remember getting double-digit yields in 1981, these may seem like
hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may not be easy to think coolly when your income is
falling, people living on fixed incomes are mistaken if they
believe they'd be better off having interest rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   Rates go up in response to growing inflation. They shot up in
the late 1970s and early 1980s because lenders were trying to keep
pace with stunning leaps in wages and prices. Clearly, the economy
is in much better shape today than in 1981, when the prime lending
rate was 21.5 percent and the unemployment rate was nearly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the prime down to 8.25 percent, the rate of
joblessness has fallen to 4.6 percent. Home mortgages are at the
lowest levels since the 1960s. And the good news for retirees is
that they are no longer getting hit with sticker shock every time
they go shopping. In fact, they are seeing many prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   The phone caller refuses to believe that. She is convinced
prices are still shooting up. For medical care and some services,
such as haircuts and dry cleaning, she may be right. But the
evidence is overwhelming that most prices are stable or falling.
For example, retail beef prices are at the lowest levels in years.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that for Choice, Select
and ungraded cuts of beef, store prices averaged $2.54 per pound
during the first six months of this year, compared with $2.71 per
pound five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That price drop is not unusual. This past summer, a gallon of
gasoline fell nearly 18 percent from the summer of 1997, coffee
dropped 11 percent and telephone bills declined 1.1 percent. Many
cars and trucks are being priced at 5 percent below last year's
models. This fall, Georgia Power Co. is seeking permission from the
Public Service Commission to lower rates for electricity; the only
argument is over how much to cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman on the phone was not interested in such data
because she is fixated on only one fact: Her income is declining.
She would rather see the great majority of Americans suffer with
higher mortgage payments, more expensive credit cards and longer
unemployment lines _ so she could feel more secure when she counts
her savings at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Her point of view is selfish, but not uncommon. In coming
months, she and others who depend on bank CDs are likely to see
further cuts as the Federal Reserve Board tries to fight global
recession and price deflation. Some savers will be angry, but the
Fed must ignore their complaints. It's time to cut and cut again to
keep our country from joining Asia and Russia in an economic
crisis.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Judiciary Committee reflects a culture at war
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two struggles going on in the House Judiciary
Committee. One, arguably the lesser, is over the fate of William
Jefferson Clinton. (As the president is now becoming known, in a
reflection of the ambiguity of his status. Our social habits
usually give all three names mainly to college presidents and
murderers.)
</P>
<P>
   The other struggle, arguably the larger, is over the cultural
disposition of the nation. Just look at the muster presented by
each party. The difference could hardly be more striking as the TV
cameras pan the committee to catch its members' mumbled votes.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 Republicans are all white. Only one is a woman, and Mary
Bono is there only by way of her husband's death in office. All are
straight, as far as we know. All are Christians. Ten, nearly half,
represent Southern white districts.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 Democrats include five African Americans, three women,
six Jews, an open homosexual. The group is geographically skewed to
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP majority reflects its members' indignation that the
nation is not ordered as the bully moralist William Bennett and as
Robert Bork, the forbidding jurist, and as the shadows they throw _
Pat Robertson and Kenneth Starr, say _ would have it ordered.
Theirs are lives of certitudes, of the straight and the narrow.
William Jefferson Clinton is a standing affront to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic minority reflects its members' skepticism at
received and by-now rote verities and fear of the political
secretariat that offers to enforce them. Theirs is a world of
contingencies and accommodations. Bill Clinton is a problem for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups misrepresent the nation. You'd be hard pressed to
find an outfit as monolithic as the GOP's even in a Moose hall
these days. The Democrats look like a parody of diversity. The
nation's demographic truth would lie near a mix of both. (Though
the Hispanic lapse would be striking.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the consequence of an increasingly ideological war that
started with Ronald Reagan's election and that begins to look more
fateful than random, these two Americas sit in judgment of an
errant president and of one another.
</P>
<P>
   The politesse of their first deliberation did not mask severe
disagreement. The Republicans held, in effect, that Clinton's lies
under oath must be fatal to his presidency, lest the rule of law
collapse. A failure to impeach, they fear, would license chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats held that Clinton's lies in the circumstances _
trying to hide a sexual affair in a legal trap set by political
opponents _ are regrettable but manageable, lest common sense
collapse. Impeachment, they worry, would secure right-wing
hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority has the numbers _ and Clinton has given
them the excuse _ to play winner-takes-all if they wish, finally
vacating the last two presidential elections, which the GOP right
found not just disappointing but so anomalous as to be invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Power will end this business, of course. Will it be power giddy
with opportunity and driven by its own indignation? Or power,
informed by wisdom instead, that seeks a resolution in political
compromise that can be, as well, socially reconciling?

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Denver (No. 1) and Minnesota (2), and a somewhat
larger difference between Jacksonville (3) and New England (4).

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Tea time and politics in Paris
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It's Sunday, 4 p.m., and tea time for Americans in Paris
who gather
</P>
<P>
   at George Whitman's famed bookstore, Shakespeare &AMP; Co., just
across the
</P>
<P>
   River Seine from Notre Dame Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, 86, has operated his store from this site since coming
to Paris in
</P>
<P>
   1951. The location itself goes back somewhat further, at least
to the 16th
</P>
<P>
   century, when it served as a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is a place of congregation for those of us who
worship books
</P>
<P>
   and good writing.
</P>
<P>
   But on this particular day, in a cramped third-floor room
crowded
</P>
<P>
   wall-to-wall with some 20 students and writers, the topic at tea
time was
</P>
<P>
   politics, and the devilment thereof. Nobody to blame but myself.
</P>
<P>
   I'd made the mistake of asking a middle-aged poet who recently
moved to
</P>
<P>
   Paris from Kentucky, a natural progression of sorts, what the
talk was of
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Monica.
</P>
<P>
   He all but exploded. ``It's asinine to speak of it,'' he said,
fuming, ``a
</P>
<P>
   ridiculous waste of time, conversation and ink, a subject that
people are
</P>
<P>
   tired of, fed up and disgusted with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry I asked _ and even more so when for the next hour the
group talked of
</P>
<P>
   nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the younger women, U.S. exchange students living
with French
</P>
<P>
   families, had the most to say. They represented a wide area of
America, from
</P>
<P>
   Florida to Michigan, Washington, D.C., to California.
</P>
<P>
   The quotes here are approximate. I find it all but impossible to
take tea
</P>
<P>
   and notes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I can't believe America is making such an issue of it. This
is a
</P>
<P>
   private affair. It should be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My French family is more disgusted with Hillary than Bill.
They can't
</P>
<P>
   understand why she isn't showing more jealousy and outrage. They
say, `I
</P>
<P>
   would look for love elsewhere myself if I were married to such
an uncaring
</P>
<P>
   person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I feel sorry for Chelsea. Imagine what she is going through.
A
</P>
<P>
   politician's family shouldn't be made part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Blame that on the politicians for the way they campaign,
exhibiting
</P>
<P>
   their families as if they were trophies and show horses. The
image of the
</P>
<P>
   family becomes part of the campaign promises.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``But when did we ever expect politicians to keep their
campaign
</P>
<P>
   promises?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Too bad Clinton didn't get involved with a military woman.
The military
</P>
<P>
   is sworn to protect the president.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Better had he found someone a little older and a little less
tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Instead, he picked the ugliest women on the face of the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I feel sorry for Monica. Just think how it must be, that
every awful
</P>
<P>
   thing you ever did is laid out on a table for all to see.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Yes, but she was the one who put them there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Excuse me, but I can't forgive her for keeping the dress.
And then, of
</P>
<P>
   all things, sending it to her mother. My mother would have ... I
can't
</P>
<P>
   imagine what my mother would have done to me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It was a message she was sending to her mother. `Look, I've
slept with
</P>
<P>
   the most powerful man in the world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Well, they never actually slept together. They never took
that much
</P>
<P>
   time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Did you see the latest poll results? When asked, 66 percent
of the
</P>
<P>
   women in Washington said they'd never have sex with President
Clinton
</P>
<P>
   again.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went: Bill and Monica, tea and sympathy, or the lack
thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, anyone?

   SF-PARTNERS (San Francisco) _ A federal judge has ruled that,
for the time being, the city of San Francisco cannot force United
Airlines to comply with the city's domestic partners law. The city
had been threatening to end United's lease at San Francisco
International Airport unless the airline agreed to provide its
employees in domestic partnerships the same bereavement and family
medical leave and travel perk benefits its married workers receive.

<P>
   HIGH-TECH-DETECTIVES (Albany, N.Y.) _ DNA testing and other
developments are expanding the job of today's police detective.
``The more the technology advances, the more collection procedures
need to advance,'' says Barry C. Scheck, one of the nation's
foremost legal experts on DNA and a member of O.J. Simpson's
defense team. But not all departments are equipped for contemporary
police work. By BRENDAN LYONS.
</P>
<P>
   ALAMO-DOCUMENT (San Antonio) _ Analysts have authenticated the
age of the paper used by a Mexican army officer to pen his account
of the fall of the Alamo. The diary written by Lt. Col. Jose
Enrique de la Pena, one of Santa Anna's officers, says Davy
Crockett was captured and executed. This is contrary to the Alamo
legend that Crockett died heroically in the Alamo. By CARMINA
DANINI.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-DIVERSITY (Berkeley, Calif.) _ UC-Berkeley students
announced that college students across the state will soon launch a
petition drive for a state initiative that would allow for
consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions decisions. By
ROBERT SELNA.
</P>
<P>
   FLEET-WEEK (San Francisco) _ Although the once-great presence of
the Navy in the San Francisco Bay Area has been significantly
downsized, Fleet Week will be as big as ever, organizers say. For
18 years, Fleet Week has honored the Navy with ships parading
through the Bay while war planes roar overhead. By JACOB H. FRIES.

   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MOBILE-ANTHROPOLOGISTS (Albany, N.Y.) _ And you thought owning
an RV was all about collecting bumper stickers and driving slowly
uphill. Not according to Dorothy and David Counts, two retired
professors of anthropology who applied their science to the world
of motor homes and travel trailers and found a sub-culture that is
more complex than might appear at first blush. By JAY JOCHNOWITZ.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   NBC-CLASSICS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Maybe television executives are
finally realizing that the American public is not an assemblage of
drooling morons needing the equivalent of electronic Ritalin. This
season, NBC wil bring us Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' and Feodor
Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment,'' the classic 19th-century
saga of an impoverished man tormented by internal demons after he
commits a pair of murders in Czarist Russia. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   DRIVE-THEATER-REVIEW (Houston) _ Playwright Paula Vogel believes
in letting an idea simmer before bringing it to life on stage.
``This is a play I carried in my head for 15 to 20 years,'' Vogel
said of ``How I Learned to Drive,'' the provocative off-Broadway
hit appearing at the Alley Theater in Houston. ``How I Learned to
Drive'' is one of the most acclaimed new plays in years. By EVERETT
EVANS.
</P>
<P>
   60S-MUSIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Take a magical history tour and
experience a flashback of '60s sounds with the release of
``Nuggets,'' a four-CD collection of ``garage band'' hits, and
``Zombie Heaven,'' featuring the hits of the Zombies. By BRUCE
WESTBROOK.
</P>
<P>
   BALDWIN-FILM-PROFILE (Undated) _ ``One Tough Cop'' may sound
like a Jackie Chan action picture, but Stephen Baldwin hopes people
will view it as a serious film. Baldwin plays real-life New York
policeman Bo Dietl, who was one of the city's most effective
officers during his years on the force. By LOUIS PARKS.
</P>
<P>
   SENEGAL-DANCE-REVIEW (Houston) _ In costumes of dazzling colors,
dancing with energy and dexterity, the Ballet National du Senegal
showed that the best indigenous folk art always will be
irresistibly exciting. ``Pangols: The Spirit of West Africa in
Music, Song and Dance'' also was intellectually fascinating. By
CHARLES WARD.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLF-SENIORS (Napa, Calif.) _ Thirty years ago, Walter Hall says,
he didn't have the right temperament to be a tour pro. But now he's
a mature 51-year-old ``rookie'' who will tee up with 77 other
so-called ``seniors'' shooting for a $1 million purse at the
Transamerica and offering examples of graceful aging. By SUSAN
FORNOFF.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NFC-AFC (San Francisco) _ Five weeks of NFL football are
behind us, and one thing has become clear: Nobody should be

</P>
<P>
   Some Italian cities, like Naples or Palermo, have a hard time
being sedate. Ask them to spin a pirouette or dance a tarantella,
and they're in their element.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan is not a tarantella _ it's a slow tango, a cool,
understated place with a measured step, where excitement can mean
strolling to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, the glassed-in
Beaux-Arts shopping concourse adjacent to the Duomo, to down a
cappuccino or just to see and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan tangos a little faster in the fall, when the big trade
fairs come to town, most notably the fall fashion showings.
</P>
<P>
   The spring and fall fashion weeks were certainly the busiest
time of the year in Milan, with tens of thousands of anxious
designers, willowy models, buyers, photographers and just plain
hangers-on descending on the city.
</P>
<P>
   But in this heady season, there are plenty of other diversions
besides fashion. Milan is a spread-out city, and the best way to
get an overview is on one of the many bus tours or guided walks
offered throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rome or Naples, where sunshine reigns much of the time,
Milan can be damp and gray. So it is also an indoor city, whether
that means lounging in one of the Galleria's cafes or visiting
Leonardo's ``Last Supper'' in the former refectory of the convent
of Santa Maria delle Grazie, or Michelangelo's tender Rondanini
Pieta at the Museum of the Castello Sforzesco.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather is nice, you might start by climbing to the roof
of the vast Gothic Duomo, a sierra of finials and statues that you
can hike across like an Alpine meadow, and which affords a close
look at the Madonnina, the golden statue of the Virgin atop the
central tower, and spectacular views of the city; on clear days the
vistas stretch northward to the Alps.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, the place not to miss is the Ambrosiana Art Gallery
and Library, 2 Piazza Pio XI, (39-02) 806921, which reopened last
year after a seven-year restoration. The library, commissioned by
Federico Cardinal Borromeo in 1607, contains 35,000 manuscripts and
700,000 printed books.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal's personal art collection forms the core of the
gallery, Milan's oldest museum. His good taste allows us to enjoy
Raphael's cartoon for the School of Athens in the Vatican;
Caravaggio's ``Basket of Fruit''; paintings by Leonardo, Botticelli
and Titian; and one of the world's finest collections of Lombard
art. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission $7,
calculated at 1,724 lire to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the heart of Milan, start at the Duomo and walk
through the Galleria to La Scala, then up Via Dante to the Castello
Sforzesco, and the spacious gardens behind. To visit the fashion
district, start at the Piazza San Babila, then stroll narrow Via
Monte Napoleone and nearby Via Spiga, lined with the flagship
stores of many of Italy's leading designers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1920s tourist tram leaves the Piazza Castello at 11 a.m. and 1
p.m. daily (also 3 p.m. in September and October). From there, it
passes the Duomo, goes out to the gradually gentrifying Navigli
neighborhood of canals and narrow lanes _ where some of Milan's
liveliest night life can be found. It then goes on to Santa Maria
delle Grazie, and back by the fashion district and La Scala.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigli neighborhood borders two canals in the southwest
corner of Milan. Once the port of Milan (the canals connected the
city to the Po River) and a tough working-class district, it has
become a trendy neighborhood, filled with antiques shops, bars and
restaurants (some on barges). Tickets, for sale on the tram,
(39-02) 72002584, are $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the Milan Tourist Office, 1 Via Marconi,
(39-02) 72524300, organizes two-hour walking tours of the Duomo,
the Victor Emmanuel gallery, the Marino Palace courtyard (now city
hall) and La Scala for $11.50. You can call ahead to reserve an
English-speaking guide.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's most important art collection, the Brera, 28 Via Brera,
(39-02) 722631, includes such masterpieces as Raphael's ``Marriage
of the Virgin,'' Piero della Francesca's ``Sacra Conversazione''
and Caravaggio's ``Supper at Emmaus.'' Open Tuesday to Saturday 9
a.m. to 9:45 p.m.; Sunday and holidays 9 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and
2:30 to 7:45 p.m. Tickets $4.65.
</P>
<P>
   One of Milan's best-kept secrets is the 15th-century Church of
Santa Maria presso San Satiro. The downtown church was built by
Bramante next to a ninth-century basilica. Of particular note is
the baptistry _ marvelous in its Renaissance harmony _ and the
trompe l'oeil apse, designed that way by Bramante because he had no
more room.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No musical event in Italy commands as much attention _ and
reverence _ as the opening of the opera season at La Scala, which
traditionally takes place Dec. 7, the feast of St. Ambrose, Milan's
patron saint. Yet the preseason offerings at La Scala are also
impressive, with ballets, operas, symphonies and chamber music most
nights during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet corps closes its summer season with Kenneth
MacMillan's ``L'Histoire de Manon,'' which will be performed on
Oct. 1 to 3, 6 and 7, with Alessandra Ferri, La Scala's prima
ballerina. Tickets are $14.50 to $52.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 opera season closes with Donizetti's ``Elisir
d'Amore,'' with Mariella Devia, Vincenzo La Scola and Paul Groves.
Performances on Oct. 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31 and Nov. 6
and 8. La Scala's box office is at 2 Via Filodrammatici; (39-02)
860775. Tickets $17.50 to $156.50.
</P>
<P>
   The La Scala museum, with historical costumes and other
memorabilia, (39-02) 8053418, is open 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to
5:30 p.m. Monday to Sunday (closed Sundays after Oct. 31). Tickets
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   La Scala overshadows other musical pleasures in Milan _ a shame,
for there are gems to be found. The Orchestra Verdi dazzles with a
varied repertory at the Lirico Theater, 14 Via Larga, (39-02)
809665. Concerts are on Thursday and Friday at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday
at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance and a rock opera start the season at the Teatro
Smeraldo, Piazza 25 Aprile, (39-02) 29006767. ``Elastesse,'' a
ballet choreographed by David Parsons, Moses Pendleton and Daniel
Ezralow, Oct. 6 to 11 (tickets $17.50 to $23), is followed by the
Who's ``Tommy'' Oct. 13 to 25 (tickets $17.50 to $29).
</P>
<P>
   An extensive Man Ray retrospective at the Fondazione Mazzotta
runs through Jan. 24, at 50 Foro Bonaparte, (39-02) 878197. Open
Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (10:30 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursday). $7.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pierre Milano, 32 Via E. De Amicis, (39-02) 72000581, fax
(39-02) 8052157, is an upscale 49-room hotel just behind the lovely
medieval basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. Rooms have modern furnishings,
usually with an antique or two. Doubles with breakfast start at
$225.
</P>
<P>
   For the business traveler, the 128-room Brunelleschi, 12 Via
Baracchini, (39-02) 8843, fax (39-02) 804924, is centrally situated
and comfortable, with simple, contemporary furnishings. Doubles
with breakfast are $260.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Liberty, 56 Viale Bligny, (39-02) 58318562, fax
(39-02) 58319061, blends comfort and charm with reasonable prices.
All 58 rooms are done up in Art Deco style. Doubles with breakfast
are $136, $157 and $203, depending on the season, excluding
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The no-frill Hotel Sempione, 11 Via Finocchiaro Aprile,
(39-02) 6570323, fax (39-02) 6575379, is near the Piazza della
Repubblica. Double rates in the 43 rooms range from $81 in low
season to a maximum of $156.50 in high season (generally through
October).
</P>
<P>
   Behind La Scala, the Hotel Star, 5 Via dei Bossi, (39-02)
801501, fax (39-02) 861787, has 30 simple rooms with modern
amenities. Doubles with breakfast, $150.75. Closed for December
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The fashion crowd fills the elegant Four Seasons on the
Via del Gesy at this time of year. But there are other options.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in 1863, the Grand Hotel et de Milan, at 29 Via
Manzoni, (39-02) 723141, fax (39-02) 86460861, has been a favorite
with celebrities. Giuseppe Verdi chose it as his residence in
Milan. The Grand Hotel retains its plush 19th-century elegance and
charm, along with all modern amenities; stepping through its doors
is to step back in history. Doubles are $377 and $447, without
breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn-of-the-century decor and exceptional wines are two reasons
to eat at the Caffe della Pusterla, 24 Via De Amicis, near the
basilica of Sant' Ambrogio. The food is simple _ salads,
sandwiches, light entrees. The wines tend to be Tuscan, since the
owners have a farm near Montalcino. Meal for two with wine: $46.50.
(39-02) 89402146. Closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Premiata Pizzeria, with garden, serving a vast
selection of excellent pizzas and full meals. Pizzas range from
$5.25 to $9.25. A simple dinner for two can stay under $23 with the
house wine. (39-02) 89406075. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Milan's freshest fish is found at the Ristorante Mercato
del Pesce, 54 Via Cesare Lombroso, near the wholesale fish market.
Despite a kitschy faux-Tahiti decor, it is worth the cab ride to
the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The fixed menu offers substantial appetizers, spaghetti alla
pescatora or risotto alla marinara, and a grilled-fish platter for
$32 a person, without drinks. A la carte meals will bring the bill
to about $100 for two. Reservations are preferred. (39-02)
55195540. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Osteria dei Binari, 1 Via Tortona, is in the Navigli
district, the hub of Milanese night life. The Osteria, in the style
of an old Milanese inn, with heavy wooden chairs and tables and
iron lamps, and a large garden, exudes atmosphere and offers
traditional fare of Lombardy, Milan's region. The fixed price menu
is $34.75, without drinks. Reservations suggested. (39-02)
89409428. Closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ristorante Peck, across from the specialty foods shop of the
same name, is modern, stylish and intimate. A wide-ranging menu
includes all the Milanese classics, from risotto alla Milanese,
with saffron, to osso buco and cottoletta alla Milanese. Dinner for
two from $135 with a nice bottle of wine. 4 Via Victor Hugo,
(39-02) 876774. Closed Sunday.

All 58 rooms are done up in Art Deco style. Doubles with breakfast
are $136, $157 and $203, depending on the season, excluding
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The no-frill Hotel Sempione, 11 Via Finocchiaro Aprile,
(39-02) 6570323, fax (39-02) 6575379, is near the Piazza della
Repubblica. Double rates in the 43 rooms range from $81 in low
season to a maximum of $156.50 in high season (generally through
October).
</P>
<P>
   Behind La Scala, the Hotel Star, 5 Via dei Bossi, (39-02)
801501, fax (39-02) 861787, has 30 simple rooms with modern
amenities. Doubles with breakfast, $150.75. Closed for December
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The fashion crowd fills the elegant Four Seasons on the
Via del Gesy at this time of year. But there are other options.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in 1863, the Grand Hotel et de Milan, at 29 Via
Manzoni, (39-02) 723141, fax (39-02) 86460861, has been a favorite
with celebrities. Giuseppe Verdi chose it as his residence in
Milan. The Grand Hotel retains its plush 19th-century elegance and
charm, along with all modern amenities; stepping through its doors
is to step back in history. Doubles are $377 and $447, without
breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn-of-the-century decor and exceptional wines are two reasons
to eat at the Caffe della Pusterla, 24 Via De Amicis, near the
basilica of Sant' Ambrogio. The food is simple _ salads,
sandwiches, light entrees. The wines tend to be Tuscan, since the
owners have a farm near Montalcino. Meal for two with wine: $46.50.
(39-02) 89402146. Closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Premiata Pizzeria, with garden, serving a vast
selection of excellent pizzas and full meals. Pizzas range from
$5.25 to $9.25. A simple dinner for two can stay under $23 with the
house wine. (39-02) 89406075. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Milan's freshest fish is found at the Ristorante Mercato
del Pesce, 54 Via Cesare Lombroso, near the wholesale fish market.
Despite a kitschy faux-Tahiti decor, it is worth the cab ride to
the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The fixed menu offers substantial appetizers, spaghetti alla
pescatora or risotto alla marinara, and a grilled-fish platter for
$32 a person, without drinks. A la carte meals will bring the bill
to about $100 for two. Reservations are preferred. (39-02)
55195540. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Osteria dei Binari, 1 Via Tortona, is in the Navigli
district, the hub of Milanese night life. The Osteria, in the style
of an old Milanese inn, with heavy wooden chairs and tables and
iron lamps, and a large garden, exudes atmosphere and offers
traditional fare of Lombardy, Milan's region. The fixed price menu
is $34.75, without drinks. Reservations suggested. (39-02)
89409428. Closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ristorante Peck, across from the specialty foods shop of the
same name, is modern, stylish and intimate. A wide-ranging menu
includes all the Milanese classics, from risotto alla Milanese,
with saffron, to osso buco and cottoletta alla Milanese. Dinner for
two from $135 with a nice bottle of wine. 4 Via Victor Hugo,
(39-02) 876774. Closed Sunday.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not tied to a schedule, mature travelers can tour many
destinations in a short period of time _ without having to unpack.
That made the ``one-city-plus-side-trips'' travel schedule the
perfect choice for Kent and Wynne Crombie of Palatine, Ill., who
were celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary.
 &HT;    The Crombies had met in Berlin when Wynne was a teacher for the
Department of Defense and Kent was in the Air Force, so the logical
location to celebrate their anniversary had to be Berlin.
 &HT;    The love birds were prepared to see a Berlin that was quite
different from the one they had loved in their youth. They spent
parts of the first two days checking out old haunts.
 &HT;    The Americans are gone and the PX (post exchange) has been
bulldozed. Their old BOQs (bachelor officers quarters) are now
offices. Only a few years ago Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's pre-war
Times Square, was a mine zone. A viewing platform _ or the Info Box
_ provides a terrific 360-degree view of this massive
reconstruction zone.
 &HT;    The Crombies planned their weeklong trip to allow them to
explore the city one day and then take a daylong side-trip by train
the next. No dodging 100 mph Mercedes on the autobahn for them!
 &HT;    They began by buying a seven-day transportation pass for $27
each for travel among Berlin's three different travel zones in the
city and surrounding countryside.
 &HT;    The Crombies alternated between the S-Bahn, U-Bahn, trams and
buses as often as they wanted. A senior discount does kick in at
age 62, but unfortunately it applies only to a monthly pass.
 &HT;    Berlin's transit system comes with stairs _ and plenty of them _
so the Crombies recommend that visitors set their own pace. By the
end of the day the couple's calf muscles had had a great workout.
Escalators are available at most stops.
 SIDE TRIP TO POTSDAM  
 &HT;    The first of three side trips took the Crombies to Potsdam,
specifically Cecilienhof, where the Potsdam Conference was held in
1945. It was set in a massive Tudor structure built by Kaiser
Wilhelm II during World War I.
 &HT;    The Crombies say that the Big Three _ Churchill, Stalin and
Truman _ might have just taken a coffee break, so impressive is the
room in which their meetings were held. They urge visitors to take
the time to stroll along the cobblestone streets around Cecilienhof
to see the surrounding country mansions even though they have lost
much of their opulence through neglect.
 &HT;    On the way back to Berlin from Potsdam, the Crombies crossed the
Glienicker Bridge _ often called the ``James Bond Bridge.'' It has
become a fixture in many spy novels and movies. Here Francis Gary
Powers gained his freedom in 1962. The walk across this symbol of
the Cold War can be quite a heady experience.
 BORDER CITY VISIT  
 &HT;    The Crombies' next side trip was to Slubice, Poland, a border
city of 18,000. With the border only 90 minutes away, it was an
excellent way to see the former East German countryside while the
train made its way through farmlands and forests.
 &HT;    The Crombies offer one word of caution: Well-dressed seniors are
especially easy targets for thieves in this area where East Germans
and Poles have a high rate of unemployment. A fellow traveler on
the train warned Wynne Crombie against leaving her purse in plain
view.
 &HT;    It's a 25-minute hike from the Frankfurt-on-der-Oder train
station to the bridge crossing over to Slubice, but a cab ride
costs about $3.
 &HT;    The Crombies joined the melange of pedestrians on the bridge:
women with strollers and shopping bags, people walking their bikes
and smokers looking for cheap cigarettes.
 &HT;    For lunch they chose the appropriately named Restauracja Odra,
which is on a main street near the Odra River. They ate a delicious
lunch of goulash soup and roasted chicken with vegetables.
Deciphering the menu required a dictionary: It is in Polish with
German translations.
 TRANQUIL SPREEWALD  
 &HT;    For the Crombies' final side trip, relaxation reigned as they
made their way to the village of Lubbenau, which is about 60
minutes south of Berlin by rail. As the train began its journey,
Berlin's industrial suburbs gave way to pastoral land and the
canals of the Spreewald River.
 &HT;    The Crombies took note of the memorial on the left side of the
street about halfway down the block from Lubbenau's rail station:
``1930-1945. Never Forget: It is better to die standing than to
live kneeling. In memory of the 11 million victims of freedom.''
 &HT;    Boat trips begin at the small boat landing in the center of
town. The flat-bottom gondolas hold 24 people and are poled by a
German version of a gondolier. The gondolas can be tricky to board
if you have a balance problem or are not steady on your feet.
 &HT;    The ride takes travelers through a series of small rivers _
sometimes only 10 feet across _ under a canopy of willows, ash and
birch. Houses lining the banks resemble storybook cottages, like
those from the children's tale ``Hansel and Gretel.'
 &HT;    The narrative is in German, but the Crombies say the visual
effects make up for any missing audio.
 EXPLORING THE CITY  
 &HT;    The trio of day trips did not prevent the Crombies from poking
into some side corners of Berlin. The Topography of Terror, a
series of photographs chronicling the Nazi era, is temporarily
housed in the remnants of cellar rooms once used by the Nazis to
torture their victims.
 &HT;    The Museum at Checkpoint Charlie offers an absorbing display of
the various ingenious escape methods used by the East Germans.
 &HT;    The Crombies also visited Berlin's flea markets for some
extraordinary shopping. The biggest such market is held every
Sunday on the Juni 17th Strasse, just off the Tiergarten. There are
many articles left over from the German Democratic Republic. The
Crombies found lots of old chandeliers, telephones, carved-brass
door handles and Prussian generals' hats.
 &HT;    The Crombies had explored Berlin and made three fascinating side
trips. In between they had the leisure to browse the corner
bierstuben, or pub, and chat with the locals. This gave the couple
a chance to be a part of the new Berlin as they had been part of
the old.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Now is the time to start planning this season's ski vacation.
For skiers in need of some pampering, here are eight of the most
atmospheric places on the slopes. Rates are based on double
occupancy in January.
 &HT;    Taos might seem like a high desert mirage of purple skies and
snow-white powder. But that miraculous Southwest powder that
inspired Georgia O'Keefe is no mirage. Here in laid back Taos, the
Inn at Snakedance (Box 89, Taos Ski Valley, N.M. 87525;
800-322-9815) counts as high fashion. The rooms are comfortable but
simple, the fireplaces welcome, a television the only hint of
luxury.
 &HT;    Skiers don't come here to watch CNN, however, but to earn their
stripes among moguls the size of adobe pueblos. Rates from $175,
including breakfast.
 &HT;    Aspen has four extraordinary mountains, the best restaurants in
ski country and a wallop of glitterati. It also has more than its
share of places that would qualify as a romantic retreats.
 &HT;    But the sybarites' choice has to be The Little Nell (675 E.
Durant, Aspen, Colo. 81611; 800-525-6200). As smooth as hazelnut
gelato, the last word in subtle, this slope-side hotel compares
favorably with the best in the world.
 &HT;    From impeccable service to marble baths and Frette robes, the
Little Nell attempts to give its guests the feeling of being the
most important person in the world. Rates from $475.
 &HT;    The Spring Creek Resort (P.O. Box 3154, Jackson Wyo. 83001
800-443-6139) has views of the snowcapped Tetons and grazing elk
herds. The hotel is a cozy place where wood-paneled bedrooms come
with a wood-burning fireplace.
 &HT;    The Granary restaurant offers a bountiful skiers breakfast, just
the thing for negotiating Corbet's Couloir on a pair of K-2s or
heading down one of the less intimidating runs at Jackson Hole.
Rates from $190 including breakfast.
 &HT;    Adjacent to Spring Creek is the newly opened Amangani (P.O. Box
15030, Jackson Wyo. 83002; 800-443-6139), which offers sybarites a
totally different kind of pleasure.
 &HT;    The first resort in this luxury chain to open in the continental
United States, the rooms have a sleek, quasi-oriental design,
drop-dead views and a quiet demeanor that suits a chain whose best
known properties are in Bali. Rates here start at $400.
 &HT;    At Sundance (RR4, Box A1, Sundance, Utah 84604; 800-892-1600),
there are few lights, no cameras and all of the action is on the
slopes.
 &HT;    An hour from Salt Lake City, Sundance is actor Robert Redford's
retreat at the base of Mount Timpanogos, the highest peak in the
Wasatch Range. The accommodations at Sundance are an idealized
version of what a cabin should be, with pine interiors, stone
fireplaces and rustic furniture with just the right amount of
cowboy chic. Cap the night at the screening room, which has
Hollywood-quality sound and vision. Rates from $195 and includes
breakfast.
 &HT;    Take the most dramatic mountain scenery in North America, add a
Relais &AMP; Chateaux property, and position it five minutes away from
Lake Louise, Canada's largest ski area. That's why the cognoscenti
cozy up at the Post Hotel (P.O. Box 69, Lake Louise, Alberta,
Canada, T0L 1E0; 800-661-1586) in Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Swiss brothers George and Andre Schwarz run this alpine
chalet-style property, which features rooms paneled with Canadian
pine, whirlpool tubs and fieldstone fireplaces. That same decor is
featured in what is arguably the best dining room in the Canadian
Rockies.
 &HT;    The cooking is by Chef Wolfgang Vogt, the award-winning 15,000
bottle wine cellar is a treat and the dinnertime pianist isn't bad
either. Call it north woods rustic meets European civilization at
discounted Canadian prices. Starting in January, rates will begin
at about $110 U.S.
 &HT;    Visitors are know to hum ``Edelweiss'' on their horse-drawn
sleigh ride around the 2,200-acre Trapp Family Lodge (42 Trapp Hill
Road, Stowe Vt. 05672; 800-826-7000). The ``Sound of Music'' family
bought this farm outside of Stowe Village in 1940 because it
reminded them so much of Austria.
 &HT;    Rebuilt and updated, the Tyrolean-style rooms come with a duvet
and a balcony with an Alpine-style view of the mountains.
 &HT;    Johannes von Trapp, the youngest of the 10 children of Maria and
the Baron, not only runs the lodge but laid out the resort's 100
kilometers of cross-country trails back in 1968, the first
dedicated Nordic center in North America.
 &HT;    The lodge is a few minutes from the prototypical mountain
village of Stowe, the downhill pleasures of Mt. Mansfield and the
headquarters of Ben &AMP; Jerry's. Rates from $140.
 &HT;    The Peaks Resort &AMP; Spa (P.O. Box 2702, Telluride, Colo. 81435;
800-789-2220) Facials, massage and a yoga class are the perfect way
to unwind after a day in San Juan Mountain powder.
 &HT;    The 42,000-square-foot spa at the Peaks lays claim to being the
best spa at any ski resort. Think of this as a contemporary
mountain chateau, with good-size rooms, terry-cloth robes and
generous bathrooms. Not to mention terraces with views of 14,000
foot peaks.
 &HT;    The hotel is a gondola ride away from the heart of the
Victorian-era mining town of Telluride, perhaps the most beautiful
ski town in America. Rates from $405.

 &HT;    Now is the time to start planning this season's ski vacation.
For skiers in need of some pampering, here are eight of the most
atmospheric places on the slopes. Rates are based on double
occupancy in January.
 &HT;    Taos might seem like a high desert mirage of purple skies and
snow-white powder. But that miraculous Southwest powder that
inspired Georgia O'Keefe is no mirage. Here in laid back Taos, the
Inn at Snakedance (Box 89, Taos Ski Valley, N.M. 87525;
800-322-9815) counts as high fashion. The rooms are comfortable but
simple, the fireplaces welcome, a television the only hint of
luxury.
 &HT;    Skiers don't come here to watch CNN, however, but to earn their
stripes among moguls the size of adobe pueblos. Rates from $175,
including breakfast.
 &HT;    Aspen has four extraordinary mountains, the best restaurants in
ski country and a wallop of glitterati. It also has more than its
share of places that would qualify as a romantic retreats.
 &HT;    But the sybarites' choice has to be The Little Nell (675 E.
Durant, Aspen, Colo. 81611; 800-525-6200). As smooth as hazelnut
gelato, the last word in subtle, this slope-side hotel compares
favorably with the best in the world.
 &HT;    From impeccable service to marble baths and Frette robes, the
Little Nell attempts to give its guests the feeling of being the
most important person in the world. Rates from $475.
 &HT;    The Spring Creek Resort (P.O. Box 3154, Jackson Wyo. 83001
800-443-6139) has views of the snowcapped Tetons and grazing elk
herds. The hotel is a cozy place where wood-paneled bedrooms come
with a wood-burning fireplace.
 &HT;    The Granary restaurant offers a bountiful skiers breakfast, just
the thing for negotiating Corbet's Couloir on a pair of K-2s or
heading down one of the less intimidating runs at Jackson Hole.
Rates from $190 including breakfast.
 &HT;    Adjacent to Spring Creek is the newly opened Amangani (P.O. Box
15030, Jackson Wyo. 83002; 800-443-6139), which offers sybarites a
totally different kind of pleasure.
 &HT;    The first resort in this luxury chain to open in the continental
United States, the rooms have a sleek, quasi-oriental design,
drop-dead views and a quiet demeanor that suits a chain whose best
known properties are in Bali. Rates here start at $400.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: CLINTON FUSES HIS DOUBLE LIVES
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 11
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Personal character, a sage once said, is how you
behave when no one is looking. We already know that, as a private
person, Bill Clinton has flunked his character test. What we do not
know as yet is whether Congress will see fit to remove him for his
bad acts.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since entering the political fray, Clinton has demanded for
himself a ``zone of privacy.'' But Clinton has also repeatedly been
willing to forfeit his claims to a private life if and when he felt
doing so would enhance his public image.
</P>
<P>
   In writing about Clinton, veteran Washington reporter Robert
Shogan observes in a forthcoming book on presidential character
that ``no candidate in modern times had been the target for so much
criticism and controversy because of his personal behavior. And no
candidate before him had been so calculating and determined to use
his personal life and values as a weapon on his own behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Shogan titles his book ``The Double-Edged Sword.'' Judging by
the president's tactics during the run-up to the House impeachment
inquiry, an apt title for his chapter on Clinton might have been
``Trying to Have It Both Ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Employing lofty constitutional allusions, Clinton's lawyers
invoked the right of executive privilege while the president was
seeking to keep his confidants from briefing the grand jury about
his dealings with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting as their main motive the alleged need to protect the
institution of the presidency, Clinton's attorneys held during that
phase of the scandal that you couldn't parse his private life and
his official duties.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House compass swung 180 degrees as the House
Judiciary Committee tooled up for formal impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders now contend that even if the president had
lied under oath to the grand jury _ which Clinton has not admitted
_ he shouldn't be impeached. In lying, such reasoning goes, he did
nothing to harm his constitutional office, but merely sought to
protect his personal privacy by fending off embarrassing questions
about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a president does not have to commit state crimes, either
high or low, in order to face impeachment proceedings. As the House
Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, notes, a Democratic Congress would have likely booted out
Franklin Roosevelt had he imprudently chosen to embark for a
two-month vacation on the presidential yacht the day after Japanese
warplanes bombed Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another thesis missing from the Clinton briefs: Although
impeachment is a big deal, it's not meant to serve as an ultimate
sanction. To remove a president from office, the Constitution calls
for a two-thirds vote by the Senate, following a formal trial.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, any decision by the House need only meet the
inferior threshold of culpability called for by an indictment.
Perhaps Congress in the end will also wind up having it both ways:
accusing the private man of low crimes but letting the public man
keep his high office.

`TEMPEST' IN A TV SET: NBC CULTIVATES CLASSICS FOR NEW SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I know we may not be smart, us television
watchers. That's why TV takes care of us, giving us shows we can
get. ``Baywatch.'' Man, that's deep.
</P>
<P>
   Now NBC is trying to educate us with the Bard and Dostoyevsky.
Whooda they think we are?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe television executives are finally realizing that the
American public is not an assemblage of drooling morons needing the
equivalent of electronic Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   Later this season, NBC will bring us Shakespeare's ``The
Tempest.'' But first comes Feodor Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and
Punishment'' (Sunday 9-11 p.m. Eastern, check local listings), the
classic 19th-century saga of an impoverished man tormented by
internal demons after he commits a pair of murders in Czarist
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The television version, starring Patrick Dempsey as the tortured
Rodya Raskolnikov and Ben Kingsley as Magistrate Porfiry, isn't a
sprawling classic by any means but it certainly is a captivating
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is taking a gamble on bringing such a high-brow literary
epic to the screen (``Noah's Ark,'' ``Alice In Wonderland'' and the
biography of Albert Einstein are also in planning or production),
since American viewers are attuned to equate television movies with
a prurient crime or disease-of-the-week knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That will change, promises NBC Entertainment President Warren
Littlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see in our lineup any cheerleader stories anymore,''
Littlefield said. ``We can continue to raise the bar. Every one of
the big events that we've done, anytime we've taken a risk over the
last few years with this long-form product, the audience has turned
around and said, `We get it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Literary snobs and elitists will immediately dismiss this effort
as visual Cliff Notes. Yes, some of the nuance is lost in paring a
542-page book down to a prime-time movie, but still captured here
is the essence of Dostoyevsky's tragic tale.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge facing the filmmakers was how to portray
the inner torment of Rodya, whose anguish is often conveyed in the
book via interior monologue.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, rather than doing voice-overs, was to have Dempsey
speak his thoughts as he walked down streets _ actually enhancing
the visage of a man growing mad and talking to himself _ as well as
showing his tormented dreams. The first method proved much more
effective, as scenes of Dempsey writhing on a bed, juxtaposed with
his nightmares, eventually grow repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey gives a strong performance as one of literature's great
characters, a man alternately brooding, generous and despondent.
Julie Delpy plays his love interest Sonia, whose forgiveness starts
Rodya on a road toward redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley's role as the astute detective may be smaller than
Dempsey's, but it is the most intriguing as he goes about his role
with a veneer of genial befuddlement _ a sort of Czarist Columbo
without the wrinkled trench coat. Porfiry is both a hunter and
savior, a man bent on salvaging Rodya by destroying him. His prey
is not the man, but the man's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty deep stuff, especially for television. But, believe it or
not, network executives, ``Crime and Punishment'' is at its core
nothing if not a great yarn.
</P>
<P>
   It might even get us to read.

O.J. DEFENDER URGES DETECTIVES TO ADOPT HIGH-TECH METHODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENDAN LYONS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With crime rates falling nationally for the past
six years, you might think the job of a homicide detective would
get a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   As the pinpoint accuracy and increasing use of DNA testing is
expanding the job of today's detective, investigators are spending
more time collecting and deciphering scientific data to clear their
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the technology advances, the more collection
procedures need to advance,'' Barry C. Scheck, one of the nation's
foremost legal experts on DNA, told hundreds of detectives from
around the world who gathered for a conference at the New York
State Police Academy this week.
</P>
<P>
   Scheck, a renowned law professor who was part of O.J. Simpson's
defense team that poked holes in the prosecution's methods of
collecting evidence, was quick to offer advice on how to build
cases through science that would be tough to disprove.
</P>
<P>
   But for some detectives, Scheck's recommendations _ such as
scraping the underside of each fingernail on a victim, and bagging
each sample separately _ clash with the realities of shrinking
budgets and the need for cops to be on the street making contacts
and tracking down witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to knock on doors, and contacts are more
important than ever before,'' said Maj. Timothy McAuliffe, who
oversees the State Police forensics division.
</P>
<P>
   For homicide detectives like Christopher Jackson, an 18-year
veteran from Brooklyn, the sheer volume of murder cases in his New
York City borough don't afford the police the chance to spend hours
on the science end of gathering evidence.

   ``When you're doing the volume (of murder cases) we're doing in
the city, you don't have the luxury. As an everyday rule, it's not
practical,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McAuliffe said detectives are realizing the importance of
gathering evidence and trying not to contaminate a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most critical elements in investigations now is DNA,
Scheck told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Citing national FBI statistics, Scheck said in 26 percent of
cases over the past nine years where DNA results could be obtained,
the person who was initially considered the primary suspect has
been eliminated as a prospect through genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have reacted to the technology, expanding
their training programs so that detectives know how to protect
crime scenes and collect evidence without contaminating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, it didn't matter, now a single hair is a gold
mine of DNA,'' said Dr. Michael Baden, director of the State Police
forensics unit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that same technology which is making today's detective job
more demanding also is enabling many cases to be reopened, and
possibly solved.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas J.S. Watson, a detective in Edinburgh, Scotland, said
that techniques he learned during this week's conference sparked
his intent to reopen two unsolved murder cases when he returns
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been one single lecture here where we haven't
picked up something new,'' Watson said.

LOSING TIME WITH BRASS ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You are a woman in your late-40s, and you are
getting dressed for work. Because you will be attending an opera
that evening, you must wear something that will do double duty. On
the mend from a respiratory virus that has sidelined half the town,
you still sound and feel like a very old person with tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Although you rarely listen to rock music anymore, you tune to
San Francisco's KFOG. It's 10 a.m., when disc jockey Dave Morey
does ``10 at 10,'' an hour of uninterrupted theme-rock. Sometimes
he plays stuff from the era in which you listened to rock music
every day. Really old stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Morey begins his show with Chase's 1971 stompin' and wailin'
``Get It On,'' then segues into the Ides of March's 1970 hit,
``Vehicle.'' (``I'm a friendly stranger in a black sedan/ Won't you
step inside my car? I've got pictures, candy/ I'm a lovable man; I
can take you to the nearest star.'')
</P>
<P>
   You may be pushing 50 and your head is clogged with phlegm, but
you get what Morey's doing on this day. Brass. Rock songs with big
horn sections. Oh, man. Other than Motown, this is as good as it
gets for the music of your youth.
</P>
<P>
   Next: Two versions of ``Grazin' in the Grass,'' Hugh Masakela's
and The Friends of Distinction's. Then _ it's about time _ Chicago,
the group that was synonymous with big, harmonious, jazz-infused
brass rock. Four cuts off one album, including the kaleidoscopic
``Make Me Smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Who next but the band that brought brass back into the world of
guitar-dominated rock in the mid-'60s? Blood, Sweat and Tears, with
the long version of one of their hottest tunes, ``Lucrecia
McEvil.'' (``They say your mamma was the talk of the sticks/ Ain't
nothin' that your daddy wouldn't do for kicks.'') With each song
you have inched up the volume on your stereo. Between zips, buttons
and belts, you have begun to snap your fingers and do a couple of
dips and turns.
</P>
<P>
   The immortal Jackie Wilson sings the old Sam Cooke hit, ``Chain
Gang.'' But who is that band behind him? Jackie always had great
horns, but ... No time to wonder. Along comes Cold Blood with the
steamiest, grindingest version of ``I Just Wanna Make Love To
You.'' You growl and moan. Go, girl.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happens. Morey plays the title cut from the 1971
Lighthouse album, ``One Fine Morning.'' Nobody plays Lighthouse
anymore. Nobody even mentions Lighthouse. (They're Canadian.) But
this song, featuring the brass and reeds of Keith Jollimore, Larry
Smith, Howard Shore and Pete Pantaluk, always has been your symbol
of what Morey calls ``the golden age of brass rock.''
</P>
<P>
   You have earrings, a string of pearls and your watch in your
hands. Round brushes are twisted into your slowly drying hair. But
you are compelled to crank up the volume some more. You think of
your neighbors, especially Robert who works at home. You feel bad,
but you can't help yourself. You turn the volume higher. The walls
are rattling.
</P>
<P>
   You fasten on your earrings, your pearls and sing along with
Jollimore, Smith and lead vocalist Bob McBride: ``We'll fly the
East, fly the West/ There's no place we can't call our own/ We'll
fly the North, fly the South/ This planet will be-come our home.''
Eee-eee-eee! Pantaluk's trumpet bursts through the lyrics and
rockets toward a long, bone-bleaching screech. You are grinning,
dancing and clapping your hands, stomping your high-heeled shoes on
your hardwood floor and playing an invisible bean shaker.
</P>
<P>
   The song ends on a wonderfully rude trumpet screech, and you
know neither you nor Morey can top that. You turn down the volume
(a little) and listen to the rest of the set: Tower of Power's
``Soul Vaccination,'' then the Beatles' ``Got To Get You Into My
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   You have lost your watch _ somewhere in your own house. Morey
tells you the band behind Jackie Wilson was Count Basie's. (Get
back!) He says he hopes you liked his show. You look everywhere for
your watch. In the wastebasket, the closet, the medicine cabinet,
several bookshelves, under your cereal bowl, in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It's gone for now, and you must go to work and the opera without
it. It doesn't matter. Chicago said so, didn't they? Does anybody
really know what time it is? Does anybody really care?
</P>

   MOSCOW _ Imagine that your parents suddenly lost their jobs
because their bosses could no longer afford to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that your family could not get its money out of the bank
because the doors were locked and the automatic teller machine
(ATM) was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you went with them to the grocery story to get your
favorite breakfast cereal, only to find it was gone from the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is what life is like in Russia today for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   A SHORT HISTORY LESSON: Russia used to be part of the Soviet
Union, a vast country ruled under communism. The Soviet government
ran the economy and provided jobs for its people, but did not allow
them many personal freedoms like travel and public speech and
religion. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up because it could not
keep its economy going and more and more people were demanding
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and many other countries once ruled under communism have
tried to change their political systems and economies to become
more like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, the change has been slow and the result in August
was an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED: Russia has been spending more money than it
brings in. After several difficult years, it appeared that Russia's
economy would grow in 1998, but foreign investors began leaving and
Russia was forced during the summer to borrow billions of dollars
from the United States and others. When that ran out, the crisis
hit on Aug. 17. Seeking a solution President Boris Yeltsin fired
his government, but that only made things worse. After weeks of
turmoil, Yeltsin appointed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in
September. He is working on a plan to help the Russian economy and
hoping that the U.S. and other nations will give more financial
aid.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BUT SMALL; RICH BUT POOR: Russia is the largest country in
the world, almost twice the size of the United States. It is rich
in natural resources like oil, gas, timber and minerals, but its
people are very poor. In terms of the country's total output of
goods and services, Russia does not make the list of the world's
top 20 economies.
</P>
<P>
   It has 146.5 million people. But the number is declining as the
death rate outpaces the number of babies born. Poor health-care and
alcoholism means the life expectancy for males is 58 years old; 72
for women.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has moved slowly
towards a free-market economy. However, the bulk of the country's
wealth is in the hands of a small number of industrialists and
financiers. Meanwhile, most ordinary Russians have seen their
standard of living drop and many workers wait months for their pay.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM: Pretend you live in Moscow. The
national currency in Russia is the ruble. Every time you babysit or
mow a lawn, you make 50 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of August, that 50 rubles was worth about $8 (6.2
rubles  &QC;  $1). Now, because the ruble has been losing value in the
bad economy -- a process called devaluation -- the ruble is worth
only about $3 (16 rubles  &QC;  $1).
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of things you want to buy such as t-shirts, video
games and compact discs are rising rapidly, even as the ruble is
falling in value. And you can't raise your price of 50 rubles for
babysitting or mowing because the people who pay you are losing
their jobs and cannot afford to pay more, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Living standards in Russia were never as high as they were in
the United States, so the impact is felt even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in Russia in June was 861
rubles, about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the
same income of 861 rubles is now worth about $50. Meanwhile,
inflation -- the measure of the increase in the cost of living --
was up 38 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   FIXING RUSSIA: It won't be easy. The crisis has raised a
fundamental political debate over whether Russia should revert to a
government-run economy as it had during Soviet times, or pursue
meaningful reforms to seek a free-market economy. The U.S. and
other countries are nervous about giving more aid, fearing it will
only be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA TROUBLES ARE U.S. TROUBLES: From 1946 until 1991, the
Soviet Union and America were involved in the Cold War, where they
sought to influence other countries and they built huge arsenals of
powerful nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic problems have forced it to cut back its armed
forces, but it remains the world's second largest nuclear power.
Russia has an estimated 22,000 nuclear weapons and caches of
weapons-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   So, a stable Russia is considered important not only for
Russians, but for the safety of the world.

 &HT;    THE RUSSIAN RIGHT STUFF: VETERAN COSMONAUT COVETS GLENN'S
MISSION
 &HT;    With photos to be placed in the International folder on the Cox

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As American John Glenn prepares for his return to space
later this month aboard the U.S. space shuttle, no one is watching
with more interest or envy than German Titov, Russia's second man
in space and the retired dean of the cosmonaut corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am jealous of him. I would also like to fly again,'' Titov
said in a recent interview at the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Glenn, Titov is the senior surviving space traveler from
his country. And like Glenn, his space glory led him to a career in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that when I am as old as John Glenn I'll also be able
to fly in space again,'' quipped Titov, now 63 and a member of the
Russian parliament. But his smile faded as he added: ``I don't
think that is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian space program has been plagued by cash shortages and
technical glitches. Its troubled space station Mir, is scheduled to
end its service and plummet to earth next year. Amid the country's
economic crisis, Russia cannot afford to meet its obligations under
the planned international space station.
</P>
<P>
   But the Right Stuff lives on in Titov. He dismisses critics in
his own country who criticize public spending on space exploration.
``These people don't understand the critical importance of science
and explorations. It is what being human is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Titov followed Russian Yuri Gagarin, and Americans Alan Shepard
and Gus Grissom to become the fourth human to travel in space.
After Gagarin's sensational first flight, Titov gave the Russians
yet another coup over the fledgling U.S. space program.
</P>
<P>
   Then 25, Titov was the first man to spend a full day in space in
prolonged weightlessness, orbiting the earth 17 times on August
6-7, 1961. The experience also gave Titov the dubious bragging
rights as the first human to suffer the seasickness-like effects of
zero-gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Titov and Glenn met first in 1962, the year after each of them
flew in space. It was the first close encounter of an American
astronaut and Russian cosmonaut during the Cold War. (The two last
met in the summer of 1997 at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum
in Washington to promote an exhibit on Russian space exploration.)
</P>
<P>
   A scientific conference brought them together in Washington,
each man reflecting his country and the times. Glenn hosted the
Russian at an impromptu cookout at his home in suburban Virginia;
Titov brought the vodka.
</P>
<P>
   They have met several times since. But neither Glenn nor Titov
could have imagined in 1962 that they would each end up in politics
-- Glenn in the U.S. Senate and Titov as a Communist Party member
elected to the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought our space careers would end with a trip to Mars.
The space programs were evolving that rapidly. But the end was
somehow different,'' said Titov.
</P>
<P>
   Titov and Glenn's path to space began much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Soviet military pilots were selected to train as
cosmonauts at a secret base, now known as Star City, outside Moscow
in 1960. By the end of the year the group was pared down to six,
including Titov and Gagarin.
</P>
<P>
   Titov was the backup for Gagarin's mission. The diaries of a
Soviet space administrator published in 1995 recalled that Titov
was perhaps more qualified than Gagarin -- but in the end Gagarin
was picked because of his easy smile and everyman appeal as the son
of peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Gagarin, who died in a 1968 jet crash, is a legend. He is buried
within the Kremlin walls and his name adorns streets and parks in
cities throughout Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Titov went on to become an air force general and was elected to
the Duma in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two birthdays -- Sept. 11, 1935, when my mother bore
me, and August 6-7, 1961, when the entire world knew there was this
person called Titov,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his fame never came close to the hero status reached by
Gagarin in Russia and Glenn in America.
</P>
<P>
   In those early meetings with Glenn and other American
astronauts, Titov recalls comparing notes about weightlessness and
the mechanics of eating, drinking and sleeping in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War was among politicians and military planners and
speechmakers. Cosmonauts and astronauts -- we had no problems. We
have a special bond,'' Titov said.
</P>
<P>
   But the years may have colored his recollections.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Glenn during their 1962 meeting in
Washington, Titov was guarded in answering questions about his
Vostok-II spacecraft and would discuss space cooperation only in
the context of disarmament, the Washington Star newspaper reported
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's historical summary of the early years of the space
program reflects the anxiety Americans felt over Titov's flight in
an age that fueled fears of the Soviets lobbing warheads from their
capsules in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people admired the Soviet's technological proficiency but
were concerned by the strategic implications. The fact that Titov's
orbital track in a near-polar plane carried him over the United
States three times was alarming to some people,'' the NASA history
says.
</P>
<P>
   Titov hopes Glenn's shuttle flight will renew interest in space
exploration, both in America and Russia, and that cooperation
between the two countries will continue.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes with sadness that his own nine-year-old grandson
has no interest in Russia's efforts in space.
</P>
<P>
   He also has grown weary of politics and does not plan to seek
reelection to the Duma next year. Instead, Titov plans to write his
memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still resourceful and I need to write them while I'm
young,'' said Titov with a grin. ``Before my mind goes and I start
telling everybody that I was the first man in space, not Gagarin!''

ANTHROPOLOGISTS STUDY MODERN NOMADS, THE RV DWELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ And you thought owning an RV was all about
collecting bumper stickers and driving slowly uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Dorothy and David Counts, two retired
professors of anthropology who applied their science to the world
of motor homes and travel trailers and found a sub-culture that is
more complex than might appear at first blush.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being a conservative group of old loners, the ranks
of full-time recreational vehicle owners are peopled with a modern,
highly social breed of beatniks or hippies, albeit with plusher
wheels. Young or old, the Counts say, full-time RV owners are
mainly those who have abandoned traditional stay-in-one-place homes
for a life of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing now is more people in their 40s who have
dropped out or been forced out,'' said Dorothy Counts, who formerly
taught at the Waterloo University in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're grasshoppers to our generation's ants,'' said David
Counts, who retired two years ago from his job at McMaster
University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Counts, who turned their research into a book, ``Over the
Next Hill: An Ethnography of Senior RVs in North America''
(Broadview Press, $16.95), are on the road promoting it _ yes, in
an RV. Their trip is underwritten by the Recreational Vehicle
Industry Association, which recently launched a new campaign to
boost interest in RVs.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had spent 20 years in more traditional
anthropological research in a small village in Papua New Guinea in
the South Pacific _ two decades of work that generated little
interest outside the academic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody much but our colleagues and our students to whom we
assigned our work and our parents were very much interested,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   They had noticed RVs while traveling, and in checking around
they found no one had done any anthropological studies on the
recreation vehicle population. David Counts talked his university
into providing a few thousand dollars to allow him to gather some
initial data for a few months in 1990; then came a 15-month study
in 1993-94 that took them to some sprawling RV parks in California,
Nevada and Arizona, where as many as 1.5 million vehicles gather at
a time in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was far different from the stereotypical trailer
park resident: in the ranks were doctors and small business owners;
a third of the people they sampled had some post-secondary
education. Many had computers on board. Many were people who, like
the bikers in Easy Rider, were in search of something intrinsic.
And they were mostly glad for the anthropologists' interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people welcomed this,'' she said. ``They feel they've
been marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the RV culture they found certain rituals like food
sharing, a behavior that takes form in many societies as a way of
extending friendship. In the case of RV parks, it showed up in the
classic potluck dinner invitation for newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   They also found that even on the road, people find a sense of
community, particularly when they get their initial ``quest'' out
of their system. Many volunteer in the parks they stay at, doing
work or entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be on vacation forever,'' David Counts said.

HISTORIAN SAYS DISPUTED ALAMO DIARY IS AUTHENTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Analysts have authenticated the age of the paper
used by a Mexican army officer to pen his account of the fall of
the Alamo, but even more relevant for defenders of the disputed
document is that the paper was available in northern Mexico at the
time, a historian said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew that the paper is old,'' said James Crisp, a
North Carolina State University history professor who had studied
the diary written by a Mexican officer, Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   The diary is be auctioned in Los Angeles on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   De la Pena's description of Davy Crockett's capture _ and
summary execution on the orders of Mexican Gen. Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna _ goes against the Alamo legend that the Tennessean died
heroically near the front doors of the former mission's chapel on
March 6, 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians have dismissed de la Pena's memoir as a fake
ever since an English translation by San Antonio archivist Carmen
Perry was published in 1975. The controversy hasn't died down in
the nearly quarter-century since.
</P>
<P>
   The diary, which had been at the John Peace Library at the
University of Texas at San Antonio for nearly 25 years, is being
sold by John Peace III, son of the man for whom the library was
named.
</P>
<P>
   A California auction house, Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, will
auction the diary and other documents from the Texas Revolution in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the historical consensus on how Crockett died is based
on reports by Susanna Dickinson, wife of an officer of the Alamo
garrison, and the recollections of a young slave owned by Col.
William Travis, both of whom survived the slaughter at the Alamo, a
Franciscan mission in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said Crockett was one of the first to be killed and
that he died outside the Alamo chapel. Travis' slave reported
seeing Crockett's body near slain Mexican troops.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Groneman, a New York arson investigator, called the de la
Pena journal a forgery in his book, ``Defense of a Legend: Crockett
and the de la Pena Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has acknowledged he cannot prove it, Groneman
believes the diary is a 20th-century fake.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Crisp, a scholar of the Texas Revolution who
defends the memoir as authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army was using the paper for pamphlets and the like and de
la Pena had access to it,'' Crisp said. ``I don't know that this
will satisfy others, but my position is that I welcome another test
because it would be one more test that the diary would pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Williamson, manuscript cataloguer at Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield, said de la Pena's memoir was written on a high rag
content paper typical of the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The watermarks tell us the paper was produced in Lisbon
between 1825 and 1832,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something had indicated to us the paper was made after that
period or was from the 20th century and clearly a fake, we would
not be offering it for sale. We're satisfied that it is what it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Auction officials believe the eyewitness journal could fetch
between $200,000 and $300,000.

NAVY TO TAKE PART IN FLEET WEEK, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the once-great presence of the Navy in
the San Francisco area has been significantly reduced, organizers
expect this year's Fleet Week to be as big as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, ships have paraded through the San Francisco Bay
while war planes roared overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Week ``is an important opportunity for the public to see
their Navy,'' Navy spokesman Lt. Philip Rosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Saturday morning, a parade of six ships will sail
under the Golden Gate Bridge and along the waterfront. The two lead
ships, the USS Benfold and USS Ogden, will be open for public
visits Sunday through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels, the Navy's acrobatic aerial team, will take to
the skies over the Bay between the Golden Gate Bridge and Treasure
Island both Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always amazed by how coordinated and powerful these
planes are,'' Rosi said. ``They are able to get a real close-up
view of the planes performing. You can feel their roar.''
</P>
<P>
   For some that roar is too much. Every Fleet Week the Navy
receives about 50 calls from people complaining about the noise,
Rosi said, and last year the mayor's office listened to nearly 100
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it,'' Rosi said. ``We listen to everyone's complaint
and explain to them that all Navy airplanes fly according to strict
safety guidelines, which makes some people feel a little better.
But others don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosi added, ``For every one person who calls to complain,
there's got to be more than 10,000 people on the waterfront loving
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Navy can continue to participate in Fleet Week
is not known because of force reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city continues to invite the Navy, we will continue
trying to come,'' Rosi said. ``But we don't know how many ships
we're going to have, and we don't know where they might be
needed.''

SENEGALESE PROGRAM NEVER MISSES A BEAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In costumes of dazzling colors, dancing with an energy
and dexterity that would send most of us to the chiropractor, the
Ballet National du Senegal showed Tuesday that the best indigenous
folk art always will be irresistibly exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones Hall program ``Pangols: The Spirit of West Africa in
Music, Song and Dance,'' also was intellectually fascinating for
its surprising comradeship with Eastern European ensembles who've
visited Houston in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Senegalese company, described in press materials as the most
important presenter of traditional West African dance, included the
customary range of songs, dances, rituals and contests of physical
daring _ all accompanied by folk instruments, principally drums.
</P>
<P>
   But, since ``Pangols'' is a tribal word representing the belief
that animate and inanimate objects alike have spiritual aspects,
the company also danced episodes in which the spirits ritually
frightened or seduced people.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a weakness for drums would have been in heaven with
the relentless but extraordinarily subtle drumming.
</P>
<P>
   Over a slow pulse that remained constant, no matter how dense or
free the drumming became, the musicians spun webs of rhythm that
allowed dancers to move at two and four times the speed of the
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers soon revealed a core style. Arms moved freely, often
swinging back and forth, left to right. Feet were spread wide
apart; knees were often bent. That was a marked contrast to the
highly controlled arm motion and closed-feet positions of western
classical ballet.
</P>
<P>
   From these basics, the performers created seemingly nonstop
movement of almost convulsive energy and intensity, which reached
its peak in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   There, dancers and drummers competed for the ``prize'' of wooing
the audience with their astonishing movements and playing.
</P>
<P>
   A typical eye-opener was the man who appeared with a large bowl,
on which he eventually balanced himself and began to dance. For the
tour de force conclusion of his segment, he lay chest-down on the
bowl, raised his legs backward and began to spin himself like a
top.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly liked the lone singer who played the 21-string
kora. Sounding somewhat like a mandolin, it is played with the
bowl-shaped belly against the musician's stomach and the neck
stretching away from the player. With low, middle and high pitches
available, the performer created his own lilting accompaniments to
haunting songs using the distinctively modal scales heard all
evening.

A LONG JOURNEY: MULTIPLE IDEAS SPARK ACCLAIMED `HOW I LEARNED TO
DRIVE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Playwright Paula Vogel believes in letting an idea
simmer before bringing it to life on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a play I carried in my head for 15 to 20 years,''
Vogel said of ``How I Learned to Drive,'' the provocative
off-Broadway hit which made its Houston debut at the Alley Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unusual for me. Some of my plays have reached the
writing phase in less time, but some have taken even longer.
There's one project I've had in mind since I was 15 years old.
Sometimes, you finally get the time and opportunity, you sit down
and start to do the first 10 pages or so ... then you realize, `I
shouldn't be doing this yet.' And you put it away until you're
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel's modus operandi obviously works. ``How I Learned to
Drive'' is one of the most acclaimed new plays in years, winning
the 1997 Pulitzer Prize, New York Drama Critics Award, Drama Desk
Award, Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and other accolades.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual coming-of-age story, it explores the forbidden,
sexually charged relationship between a young girl named Li'l Bit
and her Uncle Peck. He is the middle-aged, married man who, a la
Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert Humbert, finds himself obsessed with a
young relative _ in this case, his teen-age niece.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel, who lives in Providence, R.I., previously won acclaim for
``The Baltimore Waltz'' (produced at the Alley in 1992), one of the
most unusual plays of the AIDS crisis and a metaphoric response to
losing her brother to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple catalysts sparked ``How I Learned to Drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you let something simmer in your head for 20 years,''
Vogel said, ``many things go into the pot. There's never just one
spark. One of the primary ones was wondering whether I, as a woman,
could write something as balanced as Vladimir Nabokov's `Lolita.'
And whether, as a playwright, I could write something as nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, a play is not a novel, so it's difficult to get
those psychological interiors you can have in that form. But it was
at least partly an homage and response to `Lolita' _ and a response
to David Mamet's `Oleanna,' with a nod of affection to the form of
Harold Pinter's `Betrayal.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the kind of play I wanted this to be would require
dramatic skills I didn't have when I first thought of it. That's
why it's always wise to put something aside and wait till you feel
you can pull it off. I've heard from composers that they carry
works around in their heads for years. I don't think playwrights
are any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel often is asked whether ``Drive'' has an autobiographical
dimension. She answers that Li'l Bit's story is not hers, though it
is set during the 1960s, the time of her own youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's influenced by many things. I've been a university
professor for 20 years (currently at Brown University). I've had a
lot of discussions in my office with young people who were
processing emotional pain. Teaching is like being a minister. You
say a lot, and you hear a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel firmly insists ``Drive'' is not a play about ``the P
word'' _ meaning pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it (the central relationship between Li'l Bit and
Uncle Peck) as an abusive relationship. Actors and directors who've
done the play don't see it as an abusive relationship. It's more
about coming of age in this culture _ where there are stories far
more extreme, far worse than this one. I wanted to test the limits
of what we think is ethical behavior, as those limits constantly
change. Li'l Bit says, `You've got to let me draw the line.' But
the line keeps getting redrawn, over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``no playwright likes to say what a play is about in
just one sentence,'' Vogel nonetheless follows with a succinct
summation:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play about the gifts we receive from people who hurt
us. In some ways, it's a gift for younger people I've cared for and
taught. Right now, we're in a culture of victimization that can be
as traumatic as the original abuse, where people are encouraged to
stay in the disempowered state of the victim. That approach to
one's pain can be a not-good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other alternative is look at the situation squarely,
recognize your role in it, take a step back, learn survival skills
and move on. That is what this young woman does.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel expresses gratitude to the Pugh Charitable Trust for the
artist-in-residency grant that supported the development of
``Drive'' at the Perseverance Theater in Juneau, Alaska. ``How I
Learned to Drive'' followed her previous work for the company,
``The Mineola Twins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A grant like that can be a turning point for an artist. For
three years, I spent three months a year in Juneau, the most
beautiful spot in the world, working with (artistic director) Molly
Smith. It was a great chance to do these plays back to back at the
same theater with some of the same actors. To develop them in a
public forum and receive feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive'' made its New York debut early in 1997 at the tiny,
off-off-Broadway Vineyard Theater, directed by Mark Brokaw and
starring Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse. The enthusiastic
response led to an extended run off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Among her other plays are ``And Baby Makes Seven'' and ``Hot and
Throbbing,'' which she says major companies are reluctant to do
because of ``daring'' content.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain cowardice happening now in the
not-for-profit theaters,'' said Vogel. ``A climate of fear fostered
by the conservative right continues, whether it's picking on some
particular play such as `Corpus Christi' (Terrence McNally's new
work, being premiered at the Manhattan Theater Club this fall) or
avoiding works that address certain issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people would be scared to do this play (`Drive'),
except that it got the blessings of the New York critics _ which is
always a fluke. Persistence is a part of it: I stayed in there so
long, kept coming back with play after play.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Drive's'' success and prizes, Vogel admits, the landscape
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, things are different. Doors open all at once. There's
also the pressure of how can you top this success?''
</P>
<P>
   New York next will see her ``Mineola Twins,'' coming in January
to Broadway's prestigious Roundabout Theater, a company on a
winning streak with its award-winning productions of ``A View From
the Bridge'' and ``Cabaret.'' She calls ``Mineola Twins'' a ``comic
flip side'' of ``Drive,'' irreverent and very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gods in the theater are John Guare, Caryl Churchill and
Maria Irene Fornes. They are real playwrights' playwrights. They
have never written the same play twice. I want to emulate them, to
do something different every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel does not want to stop teaching, but with the increased
interest in her writing after the success of ``Drive,'' she no
longer can serve as a regular faculty member. She has a three-year
leave of absence from Brown after renegotiating her position so she
can work as a guest artist offering master classes for young
playwrights in short, intense periods.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to offer similar short-term workshops while a resident
artist at the Arena Stage in Washington, where she will spend
several months annually for the next three years. She will write
pieces for the company, including new works and adaptations. She
also is working on the screenplay of ``Drive,'' as well as a
Showtime cable TV project that will feature scripts by herself,
McNally and Harvey Fierstein.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel considers herself fortunate to have had two near-perfect
experiences with ``The Baltimore Waltz'' and ``How I Learned to
Drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These (the original productions) were situations where you
love everybody you're working with, love what's happening to your
work and see everything come together. At the first preview of
`Baltimore Waltz,' I told myself, `Well, if I get hit by a bus on
the way home, I'm going to die happy.' I felt the same about the
original production of `How I Learned to Drive.' To have that
happen twice in my lifetime is a wonderful gift. I'd like to make
it three. If it doesn't happen, it won't be for lack of trying.'' &QL;

THE SERIOUSLY TOUGH STEPHEN BALDWIN: REAL EMOTIONS ATTRACT ACTOR TO

<P>
   ``One Tough Cop'' may sound like a Jackie Chan action picture,
but Stephen Baldwin hopes people will view it as a serious film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its feel is a modern-day `Serpico' meets `GoodFellas,' but
leaning much more toward `Serpico,' '' Baldwin said. ``These are
very real emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin plays real-life New York policeman Bo Dietl, who proved
one of the city's most effective officers during his years on the
force.
</P>
<P>
   Dietl was wounded or injured on the job many times, received
citations and awards, and helped solve two of the city's most
brutal crimes, a 1981 Harlem convent rape and the 1984 Palm Sunday
massacre.

   In the movie, which is a fictionalized story based on Dietl's
book, ``One Tough Cop: The Bo Dietl Story,'' the street cop is
caught in a vise. The pressure comes from his boyhood friendship
with Richie LaCassa (Mike McGlone), who is now a leading Mafia
figure. The relationship puts him in several compromising
positions.
</P>
<P>
   He is being investigated by the FBI, which suspects he has Mafia
ties and wants him to plant a microphone on his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Dietl's partner, Duke (Chris Penn), is drinking too much and
running up big gambling debts.
</P>
<P>
   And Dietl is falling for the Mafia don's mistress (Gina
Gershon).
</P>
<P>
   There's more, but the topper comes when a nun on Dietl's beat is
raped, butchered and robbed, and the case becomes a political hot
potato that hinders his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The film has action, but its themes are loyalty, integrity and
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   When Baldwin read the script, he quickly accepted the role and
began firming up an idea on how to play Dietl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met Bo until after I read the screenplay and formed
this idea for the character,'' said Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was an opportunity to play a part I could really
sink my teeth into,'' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a film in which the character he was playing was
not only still living, but also was serving as an executive
producer and adviser on the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo was sticking around and keeping an eye on me,'' Baldwin
said, grinning. ``But I had a sense of Bo, and I knew what would
work and what wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very generous; he stayed out of my way and answered my
questions. When the time came that, no, he wouldn't have done it
that way, he let me know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a very difficult role, so I told these guys from
the get-go, `If you want me to do this, it's got to be what I
envision. We can alter that collaboratively as we go, but it's got
to be my vision, or you've got to get somebody else.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, 32, the brother of actors Alec, Daniel and William
Baldwin, was born on Long Island and lives in New York with his
wife and two daughters. He was a model before following his
brothers' career path. He has done more than two dozen films,
including ``Last Exit to Brooklyn'' and ``The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Baldwin has played all kinds of roles in all kinds of
movies. Aside from what seems to be a natural irreverence and
hipness, he has not tried to create any sort of screen image.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend told me, `Steve, they can't hit a moving target,' ''
he said with a small laugh. ``I never know what I'm going to do.
I'm getting offers all the time, and I'm always reading stuff. I
usually know if I like something in the first 10 pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said he has two criteria for picking a film role. He
wants to have a good time doing it, and he wants to be artistically
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   `` `One Tough Cop' was a good time because I was challenged, but
it was very difficult to do, a very intense, draining performance
on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are characters when the only time I'm into the character
is when they say, `Action.' This is a film where I was in character
all the time, when I was performing, when I was home. There's an
aspect of Bo that was living with me all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking around New York City, looking for bad guys,
unconsciously, talking in the accent, feeling a little more
menacing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin was clearly proud of having gained 30 pounds to play the
role, and having lost the weight after the film wrapped. He
mentioned the fact three times in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd walk up a flight of stairs and be out of breath,'' he
said. ``That effects you psychologically. So it was very physically
and mentally debilitating to play the part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One Tough Cop'' is getting a medium-size national release, on
about 500 screens. But the film's production company, Stratosphere
Entertainment, won't be doing a big-budget promotional campaign.
Which is why Baldwin is out on the road, beating the bushes to let
people know what the film is and isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to allow the movie to speak for itself,''
Baldwin said. ``People are telling me it's much softer than they
expect it to be _ not gratuitous violence for violence's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real honest film.'' &QL;

The MAGICAL HISTORY TOUR: EXPERIENCE A FLASHBACK IN '60s SOUNDS 
 
By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Energized by the Beatles in the mid-'60s, hundreds of rock bands
in England and the United States fancied themselves as the Next Big
Thing.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't. Most couldn't buy a hit, though some won regional
airplay and fame back when the music business was more flexible and
open.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, such Beatles wannabes were known as garage
bands, so labeled for their customary rehearsal sites. Learning a
few chords as they went along, they turned their energy and
inspiration into fierce and often tuneful pop-rock and psychedelia.
</P>
<P>
   A similar movement arose in Britain, where one group in natty
Beatles-style suits _ the Zombies _ played artful, exquisitely
crafted pop that melded rock, blues, rhythm-and-blues and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Now much of such material from both sides of the Atlantic is
gaining new life, thanks to the four-CD collections ``Nuggets''
from Rhino and ``Zombie Heaven'' from Big Beat.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era,
1965-68,'' ``Nuggets'' is an extension of a seminal album of the
same name first issued in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Stone put the original ``Nuggets'' on its list of the
top 200 albums of all time. Up to now, it's been the only album on
that list never issued on CD. Today it comprises the new
``Nuggets'' collection's first disc, while the other three add 91
more songs, for a total of 118.
</P>
<P>
   This magical history tour spotlights unknowns and one-hit
wonders such as the Seeds, the Electric Prunes, the Standells, the
Remains, and Texas groups Sir Douglas Quintet, the Zakary Thaks,
Mouse &AMP; the Traps and the 13th Floor Elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of them got airplay that a big chunk of ``Nuggets''
should be familiar to children of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Charting singles include ``Talk Talk'' by the Music Machine, ``7
and 7 Is'' by Love, ``Psychotic Reaction'' by Count Five, ``Louie
Louie'' by the Kingsmen, ``Dirty Water'' by the Standells and ``Hey
Joe'' by the Leaves.
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing are rarities from obscure bands who briefly
achieved true genius. Their sole songs here often point the way to
still more riches in reissues of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Lemon Drops, an Illinois quintet that had no commercial
success yet outplayed most bands of its era. Its ``Nuggets'' track,
``I Live in the Springtime,'' blends a potent melodic hook with a
raw, driving energy that's also found on a Lemon Drops collection
from Cicadelic Records.
</P>
<P>
   Better-known groups also merit more scrutiny, such as Love,
whose ``Forever Changes'' album was one of rock's early
masterpieces, and the Beau Brummels, whose haunting ``Laugh Laugh''
arises here.
</P>
<P>
   The Brummels recorded many other strong songs, mixing an early
folk-rock stance that predated the Byrds with the eerie vocals of a
young Sal Valentino.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino still lives in California, where he's worked off and
on in the music business since the 1960s, launching a new Beau
Brummels band four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised we got included in this,'' he said of
``Nuggets.'' ``It's mostly garage bands who were devil-may-care
musically, and we weren't a garage band. We were really trying to
do our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Mojo Men, also on ``Nuggets,'' the Brummels were signed
to San Francisco's small Autumn label.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring national hits with ``Laugh Laugh'' and ``Just a
Little,'' the Brummels recorded about 50 songs, fewer than half of
which were released in the '60s. Today you can find them on a boxed
set from Sundazed, which, like Rhino, champions '60s sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd been on a bigger label, we might have stuck around
longer,'' Valentino said. ``But I'm not complaining. I'm proud of
what we did. We're a part of musical history, which is more than I
ever bargained for.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two acts on ``Nuggets'' enjoyed sustained commercial
success: the Turtles and Paul Revere and the Raiders. The Turtles
are represented here by a nonhit, a straight-ahead rocker called
``Outside Chance.'' The Raiders' tracks, ``Just Like Me'' and
``Steppin' Out,'' were hits.
</P>
<P>
   Former Raiders lead singer Mark Lindsay thinks the songs were
included because they have the same defiant intensity of
garage-band music.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what binds these acts together,'' he said. ``It was a
belief that we really could change the world. It was get-down,
in-your-face music, and I was totally passionate about it _ still
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Raiders had many hits and a much longer career than
most ``Nuggets'' groups, they belong on the album, Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those songs were two of the first noncovers we did,'' he said.
``We'd just come from being a regional (Portland, Ore.) garage band
playing frat parties, and were just cranking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay met many ``Nuggets'' acts when the Raiders were the
house band of ``Where the Action Is,'' a 1965-67 ABC TV program
that showcased rock groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I got to watch the Seeds do `Pushin' Too Hard,'
'' he said. ``I loved that record. It was simple and dumb, but it
had that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he tries to apply that attitude to a new band he formed
for oldies tours. Paul Revere has toured for many years with a
reconstituted Raiders, and Lindsay said he wouldn't mind a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of the '60s in the '90s,'' he said. ``Music that
turned us on as teen-agers _ with all the hormones and the angst _
can still work for a lot of teen-agers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they don't make 'em like they used to, but some young
bands are in the same position as these `Nuggets' groups. They're
regional bands who scrape up the money to cut 500 or so CDs and
avoid the `business' of the music business. I do think it's
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more '60s music continues to be unearthed, perhaps in
response to the huge commercial and artistic success of the
Beatles' ``Anthology'' project.
</P>
<P>
   One prime example is ``Zombie Heaven,'' a lavish collection of
119 songs by Britain's the Zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet formed as schoolboys in 1961, and by 1964 it had its
first hit, ``She's Not There.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were far more popular in America than the U.K.,'' lead
singer Colin Blunstone said. In the United States, ``She's Not
There'' has had 2 million airplays through the years.
</P>
<P>
   The former Zombies have stayed in touch. With ``Zombie Heaven''
stirring new interest, Blunstone, along with the band's
keyboardist, Rod Argent, and bassist Chris White, recently recorded
a new version of ``She's Not There.''
</P>
<P>
   The group split in 1969, just after recording the ambitious and
oddly spelled ``Odessey &AMP; Oracle''album.
</P>
<P>
   Then a strange thing happened: The farewell album produced a hit
single, ``Time of the Season.''
</P>
<P>
   Today some critics consider the album a classic on the level of
``Sgt. Pepper's'' or ``Pet Sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Odessey &AMP; Oracle'' is available in two forms: on ``Zombie
Heaven's'' Disc 2 and in a 30th-anniversary edition featuring
stereo and monaural versions of each song, along with three bonus
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zombie Heaven'' collects that and more, with 42 previously
unreleased tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Zombie Heaven'' parallels the formats of
recently issued Beatles material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zombie Heaven's'' Disc 4 is `Live on the BBC.' Like the
Beatles' `Live at the BBC,' it mixes music played live in the
studio, banter with a radio host and unlikely covers, in this case
Burt Bacharach's ``The Look of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Disc 2, ``In the Studio,'' is comparable to the Beatles'
``Anthology'' albums. It offers demos, rehearsals, tinkering and
false starts _ often followed by sudden brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Disc 1 collects singles and album tracks, including the hit
``Tell Her No;'' the dreamily romantic ``Leave Me Be;'' and ``I
Love You,'' a hit in the United States for one-hit band People.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Blunstone's soft, eerie vocals lace the group's
cool, minor-key arrangements, while Argent plays inspired
keyboards, clearly inspiring the Doors' Ray Manzarek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without being specific about musicians, I am led to believe
that a lot have been influenced by the Zombies,'' Blunstone said.
</P>
<P>
   For all their studio precision, the Zombies also could rock out
as well as any ``Nuggets'' band, as shown on such songs as ``What
More Can I Do'' _ one minute and 37 seconds of dark, driving
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene was the same here,'' Blunstone said. ``Everybody
either was in a band or their best friend was in a band. There were
thousands of bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beatles led the way, but the availability of electronic
instruments and the popularity of simple songs made performing
accessible to people of all abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said recording was ``much more spontaneous then. You had an
idea, you went into the studio, and you recorded it. Today, you're
talking to lawyers for six months first.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Zombies music has sold ``around the world in significant
numbers'' ever since, Blunstone said, for most mid-'60s bands, fame
was fleeting at best.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was in the wind back then,'' said Lenny Kaye, a
former rock journalist who compiled the original ``Nuggets'' album
before becoming guitarist of the Patti Smith Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very close to what happened during the birth of rock
'n' roll _ the sense that you could carry your guitar out to the
garage and experiment with a three-minute song and become a part of
rock history.''
</P>
<P>
   Most bands probably didn't expect their part of rock history to
last 30 years. But today their reckless, frenetic, fuzz-tone
influences are clear.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Kaye met many punk groups who were inspired by
the first ``Nuggets'' album. Also, many songs from this new
collection have been covered during the years (Syndicate of Sound's
``Little Girl'' by the Divinyls, the Hombres' ``Let It Out'' by
John Mellencamp).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have picked up the torch and carried it
farther,'' Kaye said. ``The genre has lasted and lived on in ways
undreamed of by its creators. It's become a touchstone for several
musical generations, and I'm proud of my part in that.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you see the connection? he asks. We do. But Alex cannot even
recall Leslie, so haven't we hit the end of the line? Maybe not.
Theroux keeps going. He is full of possibilities. Ever the
novelist, he fills in the empty space, creating all kinds of story
lines and what-ifs to explain Leslie's failure to respond _ and we
are swept up in the sheer pleasure of a Therouxvian performance.
It's a monologic rumination on memory, on ardor, on the artist and
unrequited romance, on writers and the hurt of coming across
rejected books. In Theroux's hands, stories harvest stories, and so
we decide to kick back, loosen our gumshoes and let our own
original storyline metamorphose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's interesting?'' Theroux says, grasping the book
he cannot remember sending to Leslie. ``This novel is a very dark
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dark and labyrinthian novel, psychological
darkness. She might well have read the novel _ I don't know if she
liked me to begin with or even thought about it _ but after reading
the novel, she might have thought, `God, that's like going into a
black hole.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You know another interesting detail, since we're rinsing out
this, squeezing out this sponge: She kept the letter! She kept the
letter, probably as a bookmark! There's another great question you
could ask: Was the letter kept as a bookmark, which is hideous, or
as a momento?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, sinking into his chair, Theroux sighs deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact that she never got back in touch with me is _
typical. And sad. You know, it's like a tennis ball not coming back
over the net; there's no game.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been a player in many a game, he acknowledges, although
adding he has never married. ``I was thinking of the movie, `Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing.' If I can make an analogy of myself to
Jennifer Jones, who's this Eurasian doctor, and she meets William
Holden and she says she's just involved in her work, that she's
given her heart to her work, and that's kind of the case with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really go out with anybody. I just write, and, I mean,
I would like to meet some nice person ...''
</P>
<P>
   To him, the overture becomes metaphor for the risk-taking that
characterizes artists. ``It's really that the artist is always
flirting with the possible. It's kind of like living on the edge,
because _ have you read ``Death In Venice'' by any chance? It's
really like that writer Gustave von Aschenbach, lives in Munich and
goes down to Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely possible that at this wedding, or this social
event, I had met this person, that I was just _ she might not have
even looked at me twice. But it might have been a total projection
of what I wanted, of pursuing beauty in a way, if I can make the
analogy, that Aschenbach is pursuing that beautiful boy (Tadzio) in
that story.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's the pursuit of El Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's done, Theroux displays a full arc of emotions:
irked, offended, dismissive, and comic. He cross-references himself
into movies and novels, a dissertation that practically needs
footnotes for the unread.
</P>
<P>
   He places Leslie's book into a larger context. ``Every writer
has had the ignominious experience of seeing his book under less
than illustrious conditions, in a bin, or selling for a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own past, there was the time a Cambridge bookseller
disclosed to him that a teaching colleague of Theroux's, to whom
Theroux had given an inscribed copy of his first novel, had come
into the store and sold the book for $2.50. ``You have to
understand that preceeding my giving this man the book was a year
of his hectoring me for it,'' exclaims Theroux. ``So I thought it
was particularly humiliating _ then I was thinking, then wracking
my brain, because this is the kind of ontological worry you have:
Did I offend him? I mean why would anybody _ $2.50! It's not even
enough for a Buddy's Sirloin Pit hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, there's the discarded-book story making the
rounds in writing circles involving his brother, Paul, and V.S.
Naipaul. ``Authors can get very upset. I don't know if you're aware
of my brother Paul and Naipaul?'' In his new book about the two
writers' long friendship _ and the end of it _ Paul Theroux
describes the betrayal felt upon discovering that a novel he'd
inscribed to Naipaul as a gift in 1968 was being marketed by a
bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex Theroux circles back to the intrigue presented by his
own chance encounter with a woman, and now, no matter what Leslie
might really have thought of him, her failure to respond is a cold
fact that eventually provokes Theroux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lack of imagination,'' he decides. ``I think, on a
literary level, that woman Leslie should have responded to me, if
only to just drive down that highway for five minutes, see what I
was about. If I sound like anger, I'm not in the slightest bit. But
I've always thought the lack of imagination, not talking to the
person in a given circumstance, is a real flaw. ... It's spiritual
sloth, it's lack of vision, it's an amazing inability to be
alive!''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the hour, the Therouxvian deconstruction has been,
as critics have called his prose, exhausting, odd and hypnotic.
``You know, this is like seeing a wedding gown: For Sale, Never
Used.'' Like that wedding gown, a mystery hovers about Leslie _
still _ as our encounter with Theroux has turned out to be about
nothing and everything, simultaneously. Thus our call for Leslie to
contact us remains outstanding, just as Theroux long ago importuned
in a poem for his date from 1957 to get in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   But for now an unfinished story is finished. Leaving Theroux, he
refuses our bid to give him back the book and note. ``You know what
you should do with this book?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should keep this book, and when you write the article, put
it in here and just keep it in your shelves, and, are you married?
When you get married and have kids, sell the book. For your kids,
sell the book. The book is going to be worth some money, because my
ship is going to come in next year, I promise, and the book will be
worth some money. That's what I would do with the book.''
</P>
<P>
   He's smiling, and so he's asked if he makes the same prediction
for his El Dorado each time he has a new book coming out.
</P>
<P>
   He confesses, yes indeed. ``I'm long overdue.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Surred by a forgotten come-on, an author muses on longing, and
landing in the discard pile of love
</P>
<P>
   Would the woman named Leslie who met the writer Alexander
Theroux at a wedding in the winter of 1989, if she reads this,
would she please try to contact us?
</P>
<P>
   We're curious to know what happened, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because, well, because we recently came across a used copy
of one of Theroux's novels, and inside was a steamy note he sent to
Leslie. Now we have on our hands this story within a story, and so
far we know only this: that Alex and Leslie met briefly nine years
ago, and afterward the writer, enchanted, sent a novel and a note
to her.
</P>
<P>
   We found the novel, titled ``An Adultery,'' at a used-book sale
in Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard, its back up, in a long row of
worn-out paperbacks. The going price for the 1987 work was the same
as all the other books on the table _ 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Leslie, with all my love,'' Alex Theroux had inscribed on
the cover page. We skimmed the pages, realizing we'd never actually
read anything by Theroux but still knew about him: not as well
known as his younger brother, the writer Paul Theroux, but the
author of a number of literary novels acclaimed for their wit,
style, and linguistic command.
</P>
<P>
   Then the handwritten note fell from the book's pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dearest Leslie,'' began the private correspondence, ``I told
you yesterday I'd send you a book of mine, so here it is.'' Further
on, the writer urged: ``Please stay in touch with me _ I thought
you were the dearest person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write to me. Let's do something fun!''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago the writer had put these words into circulation,
albeit privately, dispatching them on faith, almost like a message
in a bottle. He imagined and surely hoped for a certain kind of
response _ a letter, perhaps, or a phone call (``Hello, Alex? Alex,
this is Leslie ...''). But here it was, this message in a book
washing up from a sea of tattered tales at a midsummer sale.
</P>
<P>
   We wondered: Whatever happened to Alex and Leslie?
</P>
<P>
   Theroux lives alone in a white Victorian house on Cape Cod, and
at the appointed hour he at first didn't hear our knock. By this
time, a week after discovering the book, we'd read up a bit on
Theroux and, in particular, ``An Adultery.'' Writing for The New
York Times in 1987, author Ron Hansen called Theroux's look at
infidelity a ``bitter, brooding, Jacobean tragedy of being used and
getting even. Exhausting, sexist, perversely cloistered,
relentlessly expository, it is nevertheless a serious and
perceptive novel, an odd and hynoptic pleasure to read, a book you
dislike and can't do without, simultaneously.'' For The Los Angeles
Times, author Susan Cheever praised the novel as ``fascinating and
eloquent'' and said Theroux's prose style was ``orchestrated like a
full symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his half-dozen or so novels, Theroux, now 59, has
written essays, poems, short stories, and plays, and he has taught
at Harvard, Yale, MIT, and Phillips Academy in Andover. Next year
he expects to publish the novel, ``Laura Warholic, or The Sexual
Intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come in, come in,'' he greets us, finally, standing tall in
the frame of his front door. He's wearing blue jeans, a sky-blue
T-shirt, and tinted eyeglasses. His unruly hair, once black, is now
rust. He ushers us inside and after a quick tour of a study and
library that are jammed with books, and during which he points out
the neatly typed manuscript of his new novel resting on a desk, he
settles into a chair at a table in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leslie?'' he had asked on the telephone when we called and
told him about the note. ``Is that a man or a woman?'' But he, too,
was intrigued and willing to excavate this long-ago moment.
Presented now with our findings, he takes the note and reads it
aloud, right through to the end, slowly turning over the words used
in his come-on to Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of love in my heart for you, even though I talked
to you a few minutes,'' says Theroux, reading the closing to the
note. Now Theroux puts down the card. ``Oh my God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea who this is.''
</P>
<P>
   No idea?
</P>
<P>
   No idea, he says, beyond the vaguest recollection of a woman at
a wedding. Nothing else, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's particularly interesting to me is to read a letter
of such semi-passion and not remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Say again?
</P>
<P>
   He continues. ``If you have ardor for someone, but they don't
meet you on that _ don't answer you, for instance, and she surely
did not answer this letter _ how can you even remember them?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bread upon the water, a potential love of my life,
someone I badly wanted to meet, and maybe wanted to continue
seeing. The overture here is a bit strained, in my opinion, and she
just completely said, `bugger it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then Theroux is on his feet, the note a fuse, his circuitry now
afire. He disappears into his study and returns in a flash.
``There's a poem I wrote that speaks to this,'' he says as he opens
up the collection and flips through its pages until he finds the
poem he has in mind, ``Contrasting Fruitage.''
</P>
<P>
   He clears his throat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the girl I took to see
</P>
<P>
   `South Pacific' in 1957, if she reads this,
</P>
<P>
   Please try to contact me?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One rainy Saturday night,

<P>
   You had on wicked silver shorts,

<P>
   Were shy, wore a gardenia in your hair,

<P>
   Whose scent went down inside me ...''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eleven more sensual stanzas follow, and afterward Theroux says,
``This is about a girl I took to the movies and, seriously, she was
a beautiful Italian girl from Medford where I was born, and I could
never remember her name.'' Indeed the poem ends: ``And I can't
remember your name.''

NASCAR SERVING UP A FULL-PLATE AT TALLADEGA, DAYTONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are waiting for someone or something to inject a little
drama into the NASCAR Winston Cup points chase between Jeff Gordon
and Mark Martin, the next two races probably offer the last and
best shots.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, Cup teams will compete in
back-to-back restrictor plate races at the Talladega Superspeedway
and the Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston 500 at the Talladega, Ala., facility originally was
scheduled for Sunday. But the Pepsi 400 at DIS was postponed and
moved to Oct. 17 after wildfires threatened the Daytona Beach
community during the Fourth of July period. As originally
advertised, it will be the first restrictor plate race run at
night.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the big deal about a ``plate-race?'' A race is a
race, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Because of several elements peculiar to plate
racing, these two events conceivably could help championship leader
Gordon substantially add to his 174-point advantage, or allow
Martin to pull to within serious striking distance during the
schedule's final three non-restrictor plate events.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the basics that make a NASCAR plate race decidedly
different.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce speeds and ensure driver/spectator safety
at the high-banked, 2.66-mile Talladega and 2.5-mile Daytona
racetracks, NASCAR runs its races there with a device known as the
carburetor restrictor plate. The plate is a one-eighth-inch-thick
piece of metal that fits on top of the manifold and under the
four-barrel carburetor of every engine. The four holes in the
plate, which line up with the four holes in the carburetor, have a
NASCAR-mandated diameter of 29/32nds-of-an-inch.
</P>
<P>
   The plate restricts the amount of air being pumped into the
engine through the carb, inhibiting its ability to produce
horsepower and speed when mixed with gasoline. For example, a 358
cubic-inch Chevrolet V-8 engine that normally produces between 725
to 735 horsepower in unrestricted form will crank out ``only'' 425
to 435 horsepower with the plate. As intended by NASCAR, that loss
of revs keeps speeds in the high-180 mph range.
</P>
<P>
   But plate racing also has produced pack racing. The reduction in
horsepower is magnified by a reduction in the ability to accelerate
away from another car in a pinch. Mix in the bumper-to-bumper
drafting that is common on superspeedways, and freight train-like
lines of eight, nine or more cars are common. While that creates
spectacular side-by-side racing lap after lap, it also increases
the probability that one wrong turn of the steering wheel could
trigger a massive wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any Cup driver about his greatest concern during a plate
race and he will tell you it is getting swept up in ``the wreck''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the two restrictor plate races back-to-back as some
medicine that you need to take, and you may as well take it all at
once,'' Martin said. ``Because when you're finished, you're
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time through the schedule, Martin finished 38th in the
season-opening Daytona 500 and 23rd in the DieHard 500 at
Talladega. He failed to lead a lap in either event, meaning he did
not collect the five bonus points available.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished 16th at Daytona and fifth at Talladega, earning
five points at each event for leading a lap.
</P>
<P>
   That figures into advantage Gordon, who has outscored Martin by
a combined 390-143 in the earlier two plate races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty fast the past couple of times at Daytona and
Talladega, so I feel pretty good about our restrictor plate
program,'' said Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``There's always a possibility of a
big wreck happening. If it happens and I'm near it, then I'm going
to be worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus, shaved 25
points off Gordon's lead with his dominating victory at Charlotte
Motor Speedway on Sunday. But over the past 12 races, this pair has
finished within one position of each other eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had the higher finishing position in six of those races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon _ who never has won a Cup race in October or November _
needs to finish fifth or better in the final five events to lock up
his second consecutive title and third in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your allegiances, the upcoming plate races offer an
increased probability of one of the title contenders getting caught
up in ``the wreck''. And it could be the one that decides the 1998
Winston Cup championship.
THE BUZZ
 &LR; subheds:NASCAR  &LR; agatea:In an effort to upgrade its restrictor
plate program, Roush Racing tested at the Daytona International
Speedway in June. Chief among the concerns for team-owner Jack
Roush were the results posted by rising star Jeff Burton. Driver of
the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus, Burton finished 40th at
Daytona and 43rd at Talladega Superspeedway this season. ``We've
got our third set of cars organized, and I don't know if we've got
a good car yet or not,'' said Roush, whose priority remains
steering ace driver Mark Martin to his first Cup championship. ...
</P>
<P>
   Derrike Cope followed his first career pole at Charlotte Motor
Speedway last Wednesday with a season-high 14th-place finish in the
UAW-GM Quality 500. It was the first time Cope, driver of the No.
30 Gumout Pontiac Grand Prix owned by Chuck Rider, has finished on
the lead lap this season. ... Ward Burton, driver of the No. 22
MBNA Pontiac owned by Bill Davis, ended an 85-race streak without a
top-five result when he finished second to Martin at CMS. ...
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan Bobby Labonte has to rate as the odds-on favorite
at the upcoming plate races. Labonte, driver of the No. 18
Interstate Batteries Pontiac, finished second at Daytona in
February and first at Talladega in April. ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite the in-court efforts of The McIlhenny Co., first-year
Winston Cup team-owner Tim Beverley of Tyler will conclude the 1998
schedule with Tabasco sponsorship on the No. 35 Pontiacs driven by
Darrell Waltrip. Beverley bought the team from three-time Cup
champion Waltrip in March, and merged it with ISM Racing and owner
Bob Hancher in July. The McIlhenny Co., the Louisiana-based
manufacturer of Tabasco, has claimed breach of contract on nine
points in its bid to pull financial backing worth a reported
$8.3-million. ``We're finishing the season with Tabasco,'' said
former Texan Kent Johnson, public relations representative for
Waltrip and Tyler Jet Motorsports in Concord, N.C. ``They \RThe
McIlhenny Co.\S went to court to get an injunction against us, but
twice a federal judge in Louisiana threw them out. We're running
the cars and doing everything we can to put The McIlhenny Co. in a
positive light. That's the way we're conducting business.''
 &LR; subheds:Indy Racing League  &LR; agatea:Points leader Kenny Brack needs
to finish eighth or better Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to
clinch his first Pep Boys Indy Racing League championship. A native
of Sweden, Brack leads Americans Davey Hamilton by 31 points and
reigning series champion Tony Stewart by 41 heading into the 11th
and final race of 1998. If he captures the title at Vegas, Brack
will become the first Swedish driver to win an Indy-style
championship _ not to mention a $1 million bonus from Pep Boys
Manny, Moe &AMP; Jack. Brack, who won two open-wheel, formula pavement
series en route to the IRL, does not exactly fit series founder
Tony George's mold of the driver looking to race in this league.
``I don't know if this series was designed for an America,
open-wheel dirt-racer,'' said Brack, driver of the No. 14 A.J. Foyt
Power Team Dallara/Aurora. ``I never really understood that that
was the case, but maybe it is. I don't really think background has
so much to do with it. If you're a good race driver, you're a good
race driver and your background is whatever. You don't need to come
up through a specific rank to be good in IRL racing. I think people
look at you for what you can do in the series here.''  &LR; subheds:NHRA
 &LR; agatea:Advance ticket sales are up 18 percent for the 13th annual
Revell Nationals, a trend that points to another record-setting
year for the National Hot Rod Association event scheduled for Oct.
22-25 at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis. Total attendance for last
year's three-day meet was 138,500, including a crowd estimated at
slightly more than 63,000 for Sunday's final eliminations. This
year's meet will feature a four-day program, highlighted by the
first appearance of the Pro Stock Trucks. The trucks are scheduled
for two qualifying runs on Thursday, Oct. 22, including a 6:15 p.m.
session that also will include the Federal Mogul Dragsters and
Funny Cars. ``We've previously drawn 65,000-plus on Sunday going
against the Cowboys and the State Fair,'' said Motorplex spokesman
Elon Werner. ``This year, the Cowboys have an open date that
weekend and the state fair will have ended the weekend before.
There should be no conflicts. If we keep selling at the rate we're
selling now, we'll be sold out on Sunday, Oct. 19.'' The week will
begin with the sixth annual Dallas Motorsports Expo in the historic
West End from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 21. The Expo is
free. For ticket information, call the Motorplex at (800) 668-6775.
FAST LAPS
 &LR; subheds:Bodine has made it  &LR; agatea:I can remember a time when
Geoff Bodine was booed with a fervor now reserved only for Jeff
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   It happened every time the Brothers Bodine, from Chemung, N.Y.,
would invade the Utica-Rome Speedway in Vernon, N.Y., for a hot
summer night of NASCAR Modified racing against local heroes Richie
Evans and Jerry Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine made the full-time jump from Modifieds to Winston Cup in
1982, and is scheduled to make his 500th career start Sunday in the
Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. He will become the 19th Cup
driver, and one of only eight active, to reach that milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine has scored 18 victories, 37 poles and won more than $12.5
million in his career, which was topped by his selection as one of
``NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers'' earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 500 starts have just flown by,'' said Bodine, 49, who is
not sure he will be retained by team-owner Jim Mattei as driver of
the No. 7 Philips Ford Taurus next season. ``The 500th start won't
mean something to everybody, but it sure does to me. Really, it
didn't sink in what it all meant until Al Larsen, our PR rep, put
together a press kit. On the cover of this press kit is the picture
of this kid _ this cute little kid _ sitting in a \RMicro Midget\S
go-kart his father \REli\S had built for him. I'm not sure what age
he was, but he's holding a checkered flag and has a big smile on
his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that picture it all really sunk in what this 500th
start meant. It meant that little kid had a dream of some day being
a race driver, and that dream came true and he made it.''
 &LR; subheds:Nuts and bolts  &LR; agatea:Robby Unser, son of three-time Indy
500 champion Bobby Unser, is close to locking up IRL
rookie-of-the-year honors. He needs to finish 24th or better Sunday
at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to earn a $50,000 bonus from Sprint
PCS.

during the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday. The

STARS AWAIT THE FIRING LINE ERA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Brett Hull stood 10 feet from an open net against the Tampa Bay
Lightning in a preseason game Monday ... and passed the puck ...
laughing. Scoring a goal just seemed too easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 7-2, c'mon,'' Hull said of the Stars' blowout. ``What
sport is there in that?''
</P>
<P>
   That Hull can be almost apologetic for his team's offensive
prowess is a sign the Stars might be building a monster. The Stars'
Firing Line _ Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen _ accounted for
11 goals and 12 assists (23 points) in seven preseason games, a
pace that would give them 268 points if all three were healthy for
an 82-game season.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part is that those were the first seven games they've
played together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what they have, it's pretty unbelievable,''
Phoenix Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick said. ``Modano is a great
passer and skater, Hull is a great shooter and Lehtinen is a great
defensive player. Yeah, it's a pretty scary group.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes teammate Keith Tkachuk took it one step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talentwise, they're probably the most talented line in the
league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, Hull and Lehtinen officially start the ``Firing Line
Era'' Saturday in the season opener against the Buffalo Sabres. As
soon as Hull joined the team as a free agent in the summer, there
were rumblings the Stars had put together a line that could become
a classic in the mold of the Montreal Canadiens' Punch Line or the
Detroit Red Wings' Production Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to put too much pressure on them or anything,
but that's a lot of talent,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said.
``You can only talk on potential right now, but they do have the
potential to be the best line in the league.'' THE THREE STARS
Imagine putting one of the NHL's best pure goal-scorers, one of the
league's top two-way players and one of its top defensive forwards
on the ice at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   That's The Firing Line.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, 27, is in the prime of his career. Third on the Stars'
franchise scoring list with 654 points in 633 games, he is ranked
by ``The Hockey News'' as the eighth-best player in the NHL and his
plus-68 ranking during the past two seasons ranks second to the
Flyers' John LeClair (plus 74).
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, 25, was the Selke Trophy winner last season as the
best defensive forward in the NHL. He finished third in voting for
the award the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's 554 goals rank him 15th all-time in the NHL and he is
third all-time in goals per game at .691. He has averaged 56 goals
per season in his career, most of it with the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's addition could make this the group that puts the Stars in
line for improving on last season's loss to Detroit in the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Greg Adams and Jamie Langenbrunner filled the
opening on the left side, and the Stars' first line had its
moments, totaling 153 points. But that still left too much pressure
on Modano to be the goal-scorer, the one who could finish the play.
And opposing defenses knew that, holding Modano to 21 goals in 52
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hull now is the trigger man. He had five goals in six preseason
games And his ability to score will force opposing defenses to
choose between covering Hull or Modano _ the kind of dilemma that
has made most of the great lines click.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact Brett's shot is so hard, it's going to create some
opportunities for both of us,'' Modano said of himself and
Lehtinen. ``I don't care what you say, people are going to be
waiting for Brett Hull's shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who already has benefited from Modano's slick passing and
on-ice vision, was just as complimentary toward his linemate. When
asked what Modano's strengths are, Hull replied, ``Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to elaborate, Hull just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Modano might be one of the most all-around skilled guys
in the game,'' Hull said. ``He does it all, it's that simple. He's
effortless, he's Roy Hobbs. He's The Natural.'' SHOOTING STARS The
Firing Line has had only one problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to want to shoot the puck enough,'' coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, Modano and Lehtinen, who combined to average 9.6 shots per
game (Hull 3.2, Modano 3.6, Lehtinen 2.8) last season don't want to
shoot? Certainly, you can't call these guys gun-shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably making a few too many passes,'' Modano said,
``maybe an extra one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or how about six,'' defenseman Shawn Chambers added.
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he's getting to know Hull's tendencies and doesn't
want to appear to be a puck hog. Hull said similar thoughts have
run through his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, one of us is going to have to start shooting
it a little more,'' Hull said. ``But the three of us, don't want to
make it look like `I want to score,' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hitchcock and general manager Bob Gainey have talked to the
players about their tendency to over-pass _ and teammates already
are starting to give them ribbing about their unselfish play. But
Modano said the line still is developing, and that the problem will
take care of itself Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the regular season, Brett won't pass,'' Modano said.
``Don't worry about it.'' STARS IN LINE Hitchcock remembers the
great lines of NHL years gone by. The Production Line of the
Detroit Red Wings, the Punch Line of the Montreal Canadiens _ they
were a part of his hockey youth that helped make the game seem
larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has the chance to help create the next great trio.
Hull-Modano-Lehtinen has the personality and the potential of
longevity that few other lines in the NHL have. Modano is under
contract for the next six seasons, Hull for the next three with an
option for a fourth. Lehtinen has one-year remaining on his
contract, but the Stars aren't about to let their prized draft pick
of 1992 get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what could happen; we have to go out there and
see,'' Hull said. ``No one can predict the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can get a pretty good picture by looking at the past.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Punch Line combined a great scorer _ Maurice Richard
_ with a great setup man _ Elmer Lach _ and a versatile scrapper _
Toe Blake. The Production Line of the Red Wings had a great scorer
_ Gordie Howe _ with a great setup man _ Sid Abel or Alex
Delvecchio _ and a versatile scrapper _ Ted Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   The Firing Line has Hull as the scorer, Modano as the setup man
who can also score and Lehtinen as the versatile scrapper. In many
ways, they're also like the Long Island Lightning Co. of Mike Bossy
(scorer), Bryan Trottier (setup man) and Clark Gillies (scrapper)
that helped the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each line has to find its own chemistry and setting up
those comparisons creates heavy expectations for the Firing Line.
Hitchcock, who already is downplaying the offensive capabilities of
his top line, said he expects Hull-Modano-Lehtinen to perform as
the No. 1 checking line, squaring off against an opponent's top
scoring line almost every night. That means they have to emphasize
both offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather have them outscoring a line 1-0 than scoring three
goals and giving up three,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Hitchcock will push for two-way play, the Firing
Line will have an eye toward offense. Hull and Modano guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around the room and it's nice to see,'' Modano said.
``We never seemed to be a team that put that much emphasis on
offense in the past. But this group should able to score. It should
be fun.''

OU BACKUP BECOMING KNOWN FOR RESCUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a brief but distinguished collegiate career, Patrick
Fletcher has played quarterback for Nebraska, Kansas State,
Syracuse and Northwestern, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great help to me,'' he said. ``If I hadn't had
that experience, I probably wouldn't be able to do a lot of the
things I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   All in a year's work in the carefree life of a scout-team
quarterback, which is what Fletcher's job description has been for
the past two seasons at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   He adds modestly, however, that the achievement pales in
comparison to that of his father, Ron, who finally gave up his role
as a starting quarterback at age 52.
</P>
<P>
   They will both be in the Cotton Bowl on Saturday when their
hometown team, Oklahoma, battles Texas in the annual Red River
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Ron, a Church of Christ minister, will be there to watch
Patrick, the third of his sons to play for OU, do a little
quarterbacking against the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   A sophomore walk-on, Fletcher is an old hand at these affairs,
having attended his first Texas-OU game at age 3. But this will be
the first one he has ever played in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really excited,'' he said. ``I think I'm having an
anxiety attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety is what Fletcher _ now the Sooners' backup quarterback _
has been dealing out to opponents thus far.
</P>
<P>
   In what is becoming a patented routine, Fletcher arrived in
relief of starter Brandon Daniels last week and threw for 130 yards
in the fourth quarter. He directed two late drives that nearly
unhinged 15th-ranked Colorado in a 27-25 OU loss.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was not a totally cheery performance, because
Fletcher's first pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown.
But thereafter, as he has in other appearances, he electrified the
offense and re-established his position as a huge crowd favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick made a youthful mistake early, but those things are
going to happen,'' OU coach John Blake said. ``There are certain
things he can do for us, and he understands and accepts his role,
and that's why he's so useful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of Fletcher's performance in the opener
against North Texas, when he relieved Daniels and revved up a
sluggish attack with five consecutive completions, spurring the
Sooners to an eventual 37-9 win. He started the next week against
TCU, but left with a bruised Achilles' tendon and sat out the loss
to California.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, and in the modest assessment of ol' dad, ``It's
kind of like being able to bring Nolan Ryan in out of the
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But really, the biggest thing about Patrick is that, any time
you use him, he'll give you everything he's got,'' Dad said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Norman, Okla., Fletcher was part of a family so
OU-oriented that the house should have been painted crimson.
</P>
<P>
   The record book still states that Ron Fletcher threw the longest
touchdown pass in school history _ a 95-yarder in a 36-19 loss to
Florida State in the Gator Bowl at the end of the 1964 season, his
senior year. A few years later, he returned as an assistant coach
(1970-75) before becoming a minister.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's mother, Pam, works in the OU visitor's bureau. His
older brothers, Ronnie and Paul, played for Barry Switzer and Gary
Gibbs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the family dog can sing the fight song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known I was going to Oklahoma,'' Fletcher said.
``I was a veer quarterback in high school and I didn't really have
big numbers. I didn't get many scholarship offers, except from
small schools, but it didn't matter. This is the only place that
I've ever wanted to go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he enrolled at OU, took a redshirt year, then settled into
the carefree life of the scout-team quarterback: each week another
dangerous assignment, impersonating the leader of the opponent. One
week, it's Donovan McNabb, the next, Corby Jones. In two years, he
has run virtually every known offense and taken thousands of snaps.
Finally, given a chance after an impressive spring, he won a roster
spot during two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``I think maybe I have an advantage,
because there's not as much pressure on me as there is on Brandon,
and the defense isn't prepared for me. But I've been able to stand
on the sideline and size them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's kind of the same thing my dad did here. I guess
you could call it a family tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   During his own playing career, Ron Fletcher was the ``passing''
quarterback on run-oriented teams featuring Jim Grisham, Joe Don
Looney and Lance Rentzel, and was used mainly in come-from-behind
efforts. In later years, however, he gained fame as the perennial
starting quarterback in the annual Varsity-Alumni game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally reached a point where most of our guys \Ralums\S
were making so much money in the NFL, they couldn't risk getting
injured in that game,'' he said, laughing. ``So, every year, I
played quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that right up until \Rformer coach\S Howard
Schnellenberger came here and canceled the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a performance of which his son remains in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad did that until he was 52 years old,'' Patrick said.
``And he was still real quick.''

A TOUR OF KINKY COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINA, Texas _ These days, Kinky Friedman lives at the Texas
Hill Country children's camp run by his family. Taking a break from
writing mystery novels and putting the finishing touches on the
soon-to-be-released CD ``Pearls in the Snow,'' a tribute album of
Kinky-penned songs recorded by artists such as Tom Waits, Lyle
Lovett, Willie Nelson and Dwight Yoakam, Friedman took
Star-Telegram writer Jeff Guinn on a Kinky-esque Hill Country tour,
pointing out certain sights and amenities that usually escape the
notice of more traditional visitors to the area. As Friedman noted,
``Lots of people drive through Fredericksburg and think they've
seen everything. They haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, where does the perfect Hill Country tour begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't go wrong eating at the Lost Maples Cafe in Medina.
Chicken-fried steak as big as your head, and a lot better-looking
than your head ever was. It's what people want to believe the
typical Texas cafe is like: friendly waitresses, big portions, not
too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Once you've eaten, where to next?
</P>
<P>
   A: You need to visit Medina. As my father says, it's a town
that's slowly been dying for 100 years. Drop into a cafe called The
Filling Station. The walls are decorated with anti-Clinton posters.
Very tasteful. Tell Velma (that) Kinky sent you. Then duck. The
characters that hang out at that place are right out of
``Deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Arky's Silver Dollar, right off Main Street in
Bandera. They've got sawdust on the dance floor and real country
bands playing. You might see Adolph Hoffner and the Pearl Beer
Wranglers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about places other than bars or cafes?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a lot. Check out the general store in Utopia. It's
out of a '40s movie. The Cider Mill in Medina is interesting. And
the Frontier Times Museum, there is a place you have to go. It has
a real shrunken head, a two-headed goat and the shoe of a woman
involved in a hit-and-run accident in 1927. These objects delighted
me as a kid, and, because of arrested development, continue to hold
the same fascination for me.
</P>
<P>
   Then take the road from Medina to Vanderpool. You'll probably
see roadrunners. Some people think they're adorable. There are
usually lots of turtles crossing the road. Also armadillos.
</P>
<P>
   But we need to talk about food some more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why food?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because you can eat really well around here. Go to the Old
Spanish Trail Diner in Bandera. I recommend eating in the John
Wayne room. On the walls in there, they've got over 360 pictures of
John Wayne. ``The Duke!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You haven't mentioned Kerrville yet.
</P>
<P>
   A: Go right to Pampell's Drugstore in Kerrville, the home of the
best Kinky Friedman memorabilia. After that, go to the best
restaurant in the world, Del Norte, for breakfast or lunch. You'll
see real Americans eating there. Del Norte's got the demographics.
There are lots of great places to eat in Kerrville. Joe's Jefferson
Street Cafe. The Cowboy Steak House. La Fours Seafood. You'd think
they couldn't have good seafood in Kerrville, but they can. Plus,
La Fours has a picture of Jesus on the wall that looks just like
Andy Gibb.

NO MORE ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am sick, sick, sick of Monicagate. I'm tired of hearing about
it. I'm tired of reading about it. I'm tired of talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to read another page of testimony, see another
segment of video, or hear the results of one more poll. Congress
needs to do whatever they're going to do about it and let's move
on.
</P>
<P>
   As a United States citizen, I am embarrassed when the president
of the greatest country on Earth travels overseas and reporters
there inquire about this scandal instead of the state of foreign
relations. As a taxpayer, I am outraged by the amount of time and
money that has been spent on this investigation when our tax
dollars are sorely needed elsewhere. As a parent, I am at a loss
for words when my 11-year-old wants to know ``What's so funny about
the cigar? What did he do with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Enough is enough already!
</P>
<P>
   The political pundits are amazed that so many Americans have
such a cavalier attitude about the affair. Well, we're
shell-shocked. The leaks, speculation, and pontification prior to
the release of the report were tantalizing like the first course of
a four-star meal. Then comes the main entree and it's a big, raw
slab of putrid beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good grief!'' we're screaming. ``We didn't expect all of that!
A burger or a taco would have sufficed.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple facts were enough. I actually imagined stuff worse
than what happened. Which is not to say the facts are not worthy of
condemnation. But perhaps the icy nakedness of this affair has
actually caused the public to become indifferent. There is nothing
left to intrigue or excite us. It's Celine Dion vs. Madonna before
she had the baby.
</P>
<P>
   And who wants to grow up to be president now? Nobody. That
should be a big concern. The future leaders of our country are
watching this spectacle and saying, ``Not in a million years. What
a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   And who caused this mess? The president, yessiree. I agree. But
did we have to smear the mess all over the floor, up the walls, and
onto the ceiling before we cleaned it up?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I do believe that the public has a right to know. No, I do
not know a better way to handle these things. Still, I've just got
to believe that there is a better way. We as a nation have not had
a lot of experience dealing with situations like this. I should
hope that we never become proficient at it because that would
require repetition.
</P>
<P>
   I only hope that once this is over, in whatever shape or form,
we take the time to establish a new protocol that is not based on
Watergate or Monicagate. It should be based on the assumption that
the future president of this country is watching and listening. It
should be designed to protect the status of the office even if we
must condemn the man or woman who holds the office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1884, William Sherman sent a telegram to the Republican
National Convention that said, ``I will not accept if nominated,
and will not serve if elected.'' If we're not careful, the
political conventions of the future won't have to buy confetti,
they'll merely shred all the telegrams and toss the pieces into the
air.

CALIFORNIA STUDENTS PLAN THEIR OWN AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Students in California plan to launch a
petition drive for a state initiative that would allow race and
ethnicity to be considered in admissions to public colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   The California Associated Students Education Initiative has been
organized in response to the decline in the number of minorities
admitted to the University of California system following the Board
of Regents' decision to end racial preferences and the approval in
1996 of Proposition 209, a ballot initiative that banned
preferences in state contracting, hiring and admissions to public
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have a moral obligation to not allow diversity to die
silently in the night,'' said Irami Osei-Frimpong, president of the
Associated Students at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Osei-Frimpong and other students said the initiative would
reverse Proposition 209's impact on the state's higher education
system.
</P>
<P>
   While students admit that their initiative would have no impact
on the regents' 1995 decision to end affirmative action at all nine
University of California campuses, they believe it is a good first
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this initiative is to enrich the overall
education that every student in the state of California deserves _
an education that goes beyond the selected text, that provides each
student in the classroom with fundamentally different perspectives
and understanding,'' said Sarah E. Kurien, a Berkeley freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The university system's regents voted to abandon race and gender
as factors in admission, a change that took effect for graduate
students last year and undergraduates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring a group called Students for Educational Opportunity
proposed an initiative that would have overturned Proposition 209,
but proponents were not successful in getting the number of
signatures necessary to put the plan on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Osei-Frimpong said the new initiative would be better organized
than the effort last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Associated student governments are staples throughout the
state, and with 106 Community Colleges, 28 Cal-State universities
and nine Universities of California, we have the most efficient
petition-gathering system in the state. All we have to do is flip
on the switch,'' Osei-Frimpong said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects the petition drive to begin in January.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... to arrogance.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To his friends, he was fiercely loyal, dry-witted, and generous
to a fault. He did not use profanity in front of women. He showered
girlfriends with floral bouquets and candlelit meals. He enjoyed
the solitude of the cabin he built in Parsonsfield, Maine, where he
hiked and hunted and lived by the light of hurricane lamps.
</P>
<P>
   He brought cannolis from an East Boston bakery to the doorsteps
of his sister's neighbors in Maine to thank them for supporting her
through cancer treatment. Once, when the parents of a friend
stepped off their flight from Kansas, he formally greeted them at
Logan with fresh lobster rolls. ``This is tradition here,'' he told
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an intense, very complex, and gallant man,'' said Robin
Dawson, executive director of the Massachusetts Film Office, who
dated Johnson for years after a messy divorce ended his only
marriage. ``He spoke his mind. Most people gravitated towards him,
but certain personalities resented him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there was a single ignition switch for the despair that ended
in Johnson's suicide, his closest friends and family are convinced
it was thrown on Sept. 8, 1987, when Johnson was called to
investigate a report of a man trying to get through a Delta
terminal metal detector with a large amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by security officials, the man snatched the bag
off the conveyer belt, tossed it to an associate named ``Kevin''
and then stuck his foot in a revolving door to allow Kevin to
escape before Johnson and a Drug Enforcement Administration agent
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson later asked for identification from the agitated
man spewing profanities, he discovered he was staring at James J.
``Whitey'' Bulger of South Boston, the mobster who by then had been
working for years an an FBI informant. Johnson restrained Bulger,
pinning him to a wall. He would later tell friends that he believed
he was among the few people to ever lay hands on Whitey Bulger and
get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal-bound Bulger was accompanied by his
then-girlfriend, Teresa Stanley, who was still carrying a bag
containing $9,923. That money was confiscated. Customs was called.
Bulger and Stanley were allowed to leave. No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What follows thereafter,'' said Cronin, then Johnson's
commanding officer at the airport, ``is a very intensive effort to
get Bill's arrest report (dealing with Bulger) from the director of
the airport and from people outside. And the assumption is that
because Whitey had been able to do this interference-free a number
of times previously and move money ... they wanted the report to
find out who the informant was.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told friends that Bulger's brother, William M. Bulger,
then president of the state Senate, applied pressure to retrieve
Johnson's report of the incident. A spokesman for Bulger, now
president of the University of Massachusetts, declined comment.
Johnson refused to release the report, unless officials agreed to
sign a receipt for it.
</P>
<P>
   The events that followed that encounter would later be
chronicled in bulging file cabinets at Johnson's home.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin was transferred to headquarters. Johnson was called to
testify about his run-in with Bulger before a secret grand jury. A
few years later, one of Cronin's successors at Logan stripped
Johnson of his plain-clothes antidrug work and consigned him to
patrolling airport parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Johnson had a confrontation with a superior who was
angered at not being told of Johnson's decision to escort
then-Lieutenant Governor Paul Cellucci around the airport. He was
court-martialed, suspended for four days, and transferred out of
Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In between all this, Billy disarms a guy with a knife who was
trying to stab someone,'' Cronin said. ``They give the guy a medal
with one hand and court-martial him with another. Somehow it just
doesn't fit. Billy was far from a saint. And a half a dozen people
will tell you that Billy wasn't wrapped as tight as he should have
been, but I know a lot of people just like him and they're not damn
good street cops. And that was Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Robert Bird, a State Police spokesman, dismissed
suggestions that Johnson ran afoul of his superiors for detaining
Bulger. He said Johnson was court-martialed for serious offenses _
for leaving his post and insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a paramilitary organization, respect for your superior
officers is important,'' said Bird.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, friends say, Johnson's perception that his superiors
had a vendetta against him became as harmful to him as whatever the
underlying truth was. Because without exception, those who knew him
say he tied his demise to what he termed ``a politically
problematic arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so embarrassed, humiliated, and demoralized,'' said
Jane Johnson. ``You're the trooper of the year and then you get
demoted and transferred to Andover? There are people on the State
Police who feel extremely badly that they're still part of an
organization that would let something like this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Komenda, whose ties to Johnson date to their military
duties at the now-closed Fort Devens in Ayer, said there wasn't a
day that went by that Johnson didn't talk about the Bulger case and
how it hastened his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people could accept it and drop it, but he just
couldn't,'' said Komenda, with whom Johnson lived the last weeks of
his life. ``The State Police was his life. He just couldn't accept
that. What he wanted was to be exonerated. He wanted to get back to
the airport, but he knew that couldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after Johnson talked to his sister about making out
a will, and sent notes of farewell to his closest friends, Jane
Johnson confronted her brother, who had sent her explicit last
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't do anything stupid will you please. I need you
here. If you're not going to do it for anybody else, do it for me
because I need you. Please don't do this. Don't even think of this
crazy stuff.' And he said, `Jane, I could die of a heart attack
tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Johnson's heart was strong. It was his spirit that was
afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   And so after he penned his final farewell note, and walked into
a verdant field here on Sept. 25, it was left to his youngest
sister to carry out his final requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight for me, Jane,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And she will. She wants the State Police to restore her
brother's name, and acknowledge it mishandled the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   A State Police spokesman said the agency is sorry if Johnson
``died with the perception that the State Police was out to get
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Billy Johnson's hand-written instructions were carried
out to the letter last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want a Massachusetts state trooper in uniform within
100 miles of my funeral. I mean it,'' Johnson wrote. And there was
none.
</P>
<P>
   According to his wishes, his 28-car funeral procession was led
out of Revere by a local police escort. He was buried in a silver
casket with a gold case that held the ashes of his dog, Scout, who
had died earlier. There were no formal eulogies or post-funeral
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   At the grave site, on a sparkling fall morning, a minister
pronounced him a complex man who longed for simplicity, a person of
honor and pride and duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Billy would like me to keep this short,'' Komenda said,
as a six-person Green Beret honor guard snapped to attention.
``Billy was a good soldier, a good state trooper, and a good
friend. We're all going to miss him. Rest in peace, Bill.''

SPYING OUT THE JOB MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ If you have ``superior intellectual ability,
toughness of mind and a high degree of personality,'' there's a job
waiting for you, particularly if you speak Farsi or other difficult
languages.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few drawbacks: You can't talk about your work
outside the office. In many cases, you can't even reveal where you
work. And, by the way, you might have to take the occasional
lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new CIA recruiting drive, launched last month by
the spy agency, which has been suffring in the tight job market.
After enduring years of staff shrinkage from cuts and brain drain,
the CIA is scouring college campuses for well-educated officers and
even offering signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Large ads in The Economist and other publications promise ``the
ultimate international career,'' filled with ``fast-moving,
ambiguous, and unstructured situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clandestine Service Trainee Program, for example, needs
people who can place moles in foreign governments and exploit the
criminal underworld. As the ad phrases it, ``Operations Officers
spearhead our intelligence collection efforts and are actively
involved in seeking new sources of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's Directorate of Operations, which oversees
clandestine work, plans to increase the number of its officers by
30 percent in the next seven years, according to spokesman Mark
Mansfield. He won't say how many new hires this involves, because
the directorate's current roster is secret.
</P>
<P>
   They also need employees to monitor terrorism, weapons
proliferation, the drug trade, and states such as North Korea and
Iraq. ``Some people have the mistaken impression that the agency
had a loss of mission in the wake of the Cold War, but nothing
oculd be further from the truth,'' Mansfield said. ``The mission
has grown more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to beef up the agency started under former director John
Deutch and have expanded under George Tenet, the current CIA
director. In a speech to agency employees in August, Tenet promised
a recruitment program ``that parallels the very best in private
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has long advertised for employees, but this campaign is
notable for its hard sell, due in part to the way the agency's
image has been tarnished by scandals over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting ad features the words integrity, intellect, and
common sense, written over a photo of a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed. Photocopies of the ads have drawn
laughs among former CIA employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC-hood has struck home, even at the agency,'' concluded a
former CIA officer with the pseudonym Edward G. Shirley. ``The use
of a smiling 21-year-old black women as being a typical agency
recruit is new, and that's simply a reflection of the institution's
desire to appear `with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the agency will not say whether the woman is
black or white, and it is not clear from the ad. Nor would
Mansfield disclose the name of the agency that designed the ad. He
did say that the CIA is making a special effort to recruit women
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is about time, said Richard Shultz, an &UR;  &LR; international
security expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University. Shultz was part of a group of academics and
retired intelligence officers who in the 1980s wrote a report
urging the CIA to improve its recruiting and diversify its
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   After obsessing for years about everything Soviet, the agency is
now more active in Asia, Africa, and the Mideast, ``where, to be
sort of blunt about it, white guys don't fit in,'' said Shultz &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said the agency must compete vigorously with
investment banks and consulting companies that seek the same
employee profile: personable, multilingual, computer-literate,
willing to live abroad. The CIA is particularly interested in
engineers, biochemists, economists, and people fluent in Farsi,
Arabic, and the languages of the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mansfield, college recruiters, ads, and the
agency's Web site generate more than 100,000 inquiries and 30,000
resumes from job seekers every year. The agency has streamlined its
hiring so that background checks that used to take six months can
now be done in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of headhunters out there ready to pounce on
strong candidates,'' Tenet said in a speech in August. ``To delay
is to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency &UR;  &LR; has decided to focus on just 60 colleges that have
proven records with the CIA or substantial numbers of minorities &UR; . &LR; 
They include Harvard, MIT, and Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also trying to overcome misperceptions that have
hampered it in the past. For example, someone who experimented with
drugs years ago is not automatically disqualified as an applicant
today. ``We look at how recent and frequent the drug use was,''
Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of the agency has suffered from the cases of
Aldrich Ames and Harold Nicholson, both convicted double agents who
spied for Moscow, said Abram Shulsky, a former staff member of the
Senate Intelligence Committee and author of ``Silent Warfare,'' a
book about intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough has come out like the Ames case that has made the
agency look unattractive,'' Shulsky said. During the Cold War,
recruiting was easier because ``part of the attraction was that you
belonged to a really elite institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the agency has lost its luster, it has had trouble recruiting
on the Ivy League campuses that used to provide a steady stream of
new officers, Shulsky said. ``In a sense, they're sort of forced
out to the more open job market.''

DECONSTRUCTING BOB VILA

 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Inside his comfortable study, a room laced
with rich colors, antique maps, and family photographs, Bob Vila is
working the phone, talking to his office on Cape Cod. Can a
Manhattan dinner reservation at Nobu later in the week be switched
to Le Bernadin, he asks? Done. Can the press be kept at bay during
a location scouting trip to the Virginia governor's mansion the
next day? Good. And can the filming in Massachusetts of a public
service announcement for the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development begin at 10 a.m. _ promptly _ the day after that?
Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   So much Bob Vila, so little time. It was 20 years ago that he
embarked on an unexpected career that has cast him as America's
Handyman, first as host of ``This Old House'' on PBS and now as
star and producer of the syndicated ``Bob Vila's Home Again.''
Meanwhile, he pitches tools for Sears, has had eight books
ghostwritten under his name, was the model for the hit sitcom
``Home Improvement,'' hosts regular how-to segments on CBS's ``This
Morning,'' and is the subject of an obligatory Web site where you
can, among other things, read Bob's Bio and join Bob's Fan Club.
True, there has been a bump or two along the way, but 52-year-old
Robert Joseph Vila remains the guy we think of when we think of a
do-it-yourselfer up on a stepladder in just-bought Dockers and a
Land's End shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name another infotainer who has a higher name recognition
factor,'' challenges Michael Ferrone, who has been Vila's
co-executive producer and close friend for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Martha Stewart and Julia Child certainly come to mind.
Which is fitting, because Vila turns out to be a lot closer to
these two doyennes of style than to that fellow we imagine atop
that ladder. True, Robert Ryley, who does much of the carpentry
work on ``Bob Vila's Home Again,'' says the host of the show can
glaze a mean windowpane if necessary. But Vila holds neither a
trade union card nor a contractor's license. His hands are not
calloused. His library is not filled with how-to books (not even
his own), but with tomes on art, architecture, and food. And while
he sometimes drives a Chevrolet pickup truck _ one of the sponsors
of his show _ he's more likely to be found behind the wheel of his
Mercedes 500.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, home improvement simply isn't Bob Vila's idea
of fun. ``Fixing things is not the way he wants to spend his
time,'' says his wife, Harvard Business School senior lecturer
Diana Barrett. ``He's just not a fix-it person,'' she adds,
recalling that when her husband recently discovered a broken light
socket in their home, he simply told her to call an electrician.
Vila himself sheepishly admits that he was supposed to replace a
clothes hook for 13-year-old Susannah, one of his and Barrett's
three children, this past summer and never got around to it. And
his home ``workshop'' _ yes, it is well-stocked with Sears
Craftsman tools _ serves mainly as a storage area for artwork
created by their 22-year-old son, Christopher, a student at The
School of the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not,'' Vila concedes, ``have an active woodworking
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd really rather talk about, say, food, which he did one
recent morning when his wife mentioned another broken light and he
quickly changed the subject to herbed chicken. He spends more time
in his wine cellar than in that mostly abandoned workshop. He talks
glowingly about shopping during the afternoon for something _
Chilean sea bass, for example _ that he and Barrett can cook
together that night, and she says he likes almost nothing better
than to stand back and admire his own well-set table. Hello, Julia.
Hello, Martha.
</P>
<P>
   Vila's desire for the good life can be seen at any of the four
upscale homes he and his family enjoy. In addition to the 1897
shingle-style, mulberry-colored manse here in the leafy
neighborhood of Bill Weld and Yo-Yo Ma, there is also a
neo-Victorian waterfront compound in the gated community of Oyster
Harbors on Cape Cod; a 30-year-old home in Chilmark, on Martha's
Vineyard; and a 1920s Mediterranean-style home in his native
Florida, on the Gulf Coast in Boca Grande. A dedicated boater, Vila
this year took delivery of a 36-foot cabin cruiser designed and
built by sailmeister Ted Hood. Each year he hosts a tarpon-fishing
trip in Florida, an annual outing on which the invitees are
``usually agents and lawyers'' rather than the hammer-and-saw set.
Says Vila's old friend Rikk Larsen, a local software executive:
``What I like about him is that he acknowledges that he enjoys the
trappings of success.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Firestorms and furniture
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Barrett, the reasons for what she calls her husband's
``interest in the process of living in as high a quality way as
possible'' is a reaction to his decidedly middle-class roots as the
son of Cuban immigrants. He lives in a kind of high Victorian
style, surrounding himself with lots of objet d'art such as
antiques, paintings, and old books. ``Bob came from very little, so
enjoys having stuff,'' his wife says. ``Really good stuff. He loves
being able to buy a really beautiful thing and bring it home. And
then he just can't leave it alone. He has to touch it, or move it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Vila has become rich, he is not idly rich. Highly
organized and meticulous _ have you ever seen a hairdo or a beard
so perfectly groomed? _ he remains the micromanager of all he
surveys despite his contention that ``I think I've gotten better at
not having to control every detail of my life.'' He's got enough
energy to bike 50 to 75 miles a dozen or so times each summer. If
the pace slackens during tapings of ``Bob Vila's Home Again'' (and
the boss does his best to make sure it doesn't), he's likely to put
a cell phone to his ear or take a quick meeting with Ferrone, his
co-producer. His travel schedule, which includes endless
glad-handing on behalf of Sears, has him crisscrossing the country
in an assortment of commercial and private jets. One recent
weekend: Cape Cod to Illinois to Michigan to Minnesota to Colorado,
back to Illinois, back to the Cape.
</P>
<P>
   He's in motion even when there doesn't seem to be a reason to
be. ``Whenever he gets tense and nervous,'' his wife says, ``he
moves the furniture around.''
</P>
<P>
   He can be prickly. During TV tapings in particular, even on good
days, he feels the tension. He repeatedly checks his watch. Are we
ready to start? Why not? Are we running late? Why? ``I probably can
be a hard person to work for,'' he concedes. ``I'm easily
frustrated if things that have been committed to fall apart. If an
architect says something will be done and it isn't, I get
frustrated. I admire punctuality. People not keeping to timetables
makes me unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-blown firestorms are reportedly rare. ``I've seen him lose
it only about three times,'' says Sarah Beasley, who's worked on
Vila's show since its inception nine years ago and is now its
co-producer. But there's enough of an edge to Vila when he shoots
his show that his wife says she does her best to avoid visiting the
set. ``He's not the same person there as he is at home,'' she says.
``He's much softer, much more interactive when he's at home.''

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... he's at home.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But whether he's one person or two, he clearly enjoys being Bob
Vila. ``I've never known anyone to be as happy with stardom or
recognition as Bob,'' says Dick Holden, who was the camera operator
on ``This Old House'' for several years. Vila welcomes the
horn-honkers, the hand-shakers, and the folks who thrust 2-by-4s in
his face for autographs. He's even pleased and amused that so many
strangers feel compelled to tell him who he is (``Hey! You're Bob
Vila!''). And such attention isn't something that's merely
tolerated. ``It's important to him,'' says Beasley, and her boss
concurs: ``It's ego-gratifying. I mean, they're there to tell me
that they like me, not that I'm a dumb son-of-a-bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   His is such an unlikely tale, after all. Raised primarily in
Miami, he switched from architecture to journalism at the
University of Florida because he couldn't cut the math. He worked
in the Peace Corps in Panama (He still calls himself ``a
child-of-the-'60s Kennedy Democrat.''), protested against the war
in Vietnam, worked in Germany as a freelance editor and later a
stagehand, and came to Boston to study architecture again.
</P>
<P>
   When he realized there was more money in real estate development
and contracting, he slipped into the renovation business. One of
his earliest employers was Diana Barrett, a divorcee who was
studying at the Harvard Business School and had chosen her latest
surname from a local telephone book. Like Vila, she is Hispanic.
(Her father was Colombian, her mother Costa Rican.) Unlike her
husband, she comes from a monied family. The buzz has always been
that she became Vila's financial angel as well as his wife, but she
demurs. ``I've never inherited money,'' she says. For their first
date, Vila built her a fire, put down a rug, and served up a picnic
_ all in a Back Bay building that he was renovating for her.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A sideline takes off
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the the late 1970s, Vila and Barrett, now spouses and
business partners, renovated their Victorian Italianate home in
Newton. It became the subject of both a newspaper and a magazine
article, as well as the focus of a WGBH-TV (Ch.2) pilot for a
series about local homes that had been done over. When the show
metamorphosed into a step-by-step home improvement program,
producer Russell Morash thought Vila might make a good host. &UR;  &LR; ``He
(Vila) was a full-grown talent from the first moment,'' recalls
Holden, the cameraman. ``He wasn't at a loss for words, and he had
a comfort level in front of the camera that a lot of people never
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Vila saw the show as a sideline that might
publicize his business. The rest is television history: how ``This
Old House,'' which eventually dealt with the renovations of several
homes, went from an unknown local production to a national PBS hit,
taking Vila, who initially earned $250 per show, along with it.
When it debuted, some of the fledgling hosts's friends threw him a
party. It's theme: ``Bobby Goes to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Vila, whose previous television experience consisted of an
appearance in a Peace Corps training video, was loved by the camera
and returned the favor. Holden recalls him as ``a fully grown
talent from the first minute.'' As time passed, the rising star saw
the possibilities of expanding his franchise. He began endorsing
products such as Time-Life Books and Rickel Home Centers. In 1989,
when WGBH asked him to end these lucrative outside deals because
they conflicted with the show's underwriters, he refused and was
fired. (``He moved the furniture about 10 times when that
happened,'' Barrett remembers.) The break-up was bitter, and it
remains so to this day. Vila won't discuss it, except to say, ``A
lot of people didn't behave in a way I expected them to behave.''
Morash, still producer of ``This Old House,'' offers even less: ``I
will talk about anything but Bob Vila.''
</P>
<P>
   (Vila's carpenter/sidekick on ``This Old House'' was Norm Abram,
who lives in Carlisle and still appears on the PBS show. Even
today, many people think of Vila and Abram as a team, and strangers
often ask each about the other. Not only haven't they spoken in 10
years, but they were never close in the first place. ``He was
pretty glitzy, pretty high-end,'' Abram says of Vila. ``I'm not.'')
</P>
<P>
   Picking himself up after his dismissal, Vila created his own
home renovation show and later a small company to produce it under
contract with Sears. ``Bob Vila's Home Again'' is currently seen in
about 180 markets, according to Ferrone, and it is as fast-paced as
its star. Vila usually works without a script, eschews retakes, and
literally runs the show. (Director Chris Gilbert describes his own
role as ``subtle massaging.'') The host interviews heating
contractors here, visits a lighting plant there, and is Bob Vila
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vila goes `Home Again'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to tell where Vila leaves off
and his show begins. This is true in no small part because the
program, which often makes use of product discounts and donations,
frequently features the renovation or construction of Vila
properties. Some of these _ a Malibu beach house, for example, or a
Martha's Vineyard Victorian _ were bought prior to restoration and
then sold afterward, according to Vila.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bob Vila's Home Again'' has also put up a greenhouse
addition on the Vila Cape Cod home, and has remodeled the kitchen
in the Miami house of Vila's sister, Teresa Lopez. Most notably,
the show featured the complete renovation and restoration of Vila's
Cambridge house, which was purchased for $1.05 million in 1996 and
is now valued by the city, post-makeover, at $1.8 million. And the
Boston Leather District condo that is being featured on the show
this season was purchased in May by young Christopher Vila as an
empty shell for $300,000. His father says that the spiffy interior
being added on the show is expected to cost in excess of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Vila was disappointed to learn that the
Hearst Magazines Division was stopping the presses on Bob Vila's
American Home, a magazine based on his show, after just five
issues. But besides his WGBH sacking, this failure represents the
only visible bump in what has otherwise been a smooth 20-year ride.
``I'm Bob Vila and it's good to have you home again,'' Vila
declares with a small and satisfied smile at the end of every show.
Maybe he should simply say, ``I'm Bob Vila and it's good.''

A SHRINE TO NEW ENGLAND FOLK ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSEX, Mass. _ At the end of a country lane here the land
dramatically opens up to reveal a sprawling 18th-century persimmon
farmhouse and adjacent red barn. Beyond these colorful buildings,
lush open fields slope down to fog-embraced marshlands and the
Essex River. Nothing from the 20th century intrudes on these
picturesque 135 acres. Only the music of songbirds and a greeting
from a horse disrupt the silence.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, the rooms are filled with American folk art.
Every surface in the eight rooms is covered with 18th- and
19th-century paintings, rugs, pottery, Shaker boxes, decoys,
weathervanes, painted furniture, and ostrich eggs. There are more
than 2,000 objects in all. And they remain exactly where the
owners, who named the property Cogswell's Grant, placed them.
</P>
<P>
   The owners were Nina and Bertram K. Little, who over six decades
assembled one of the world's finest collections of American
decorative arts, or folk art. What is now on view for the public in
the Little's unheated former summer home is the largest collection
of what Nina called ``country arts'' in the setting where it was
originally assembled.
</P>
<P>
   This setting was first and foremost a home _ a retreat and
working farm where the Littles brought their three children during
the summer months. They named it Cogswell's Grant because the land
was once part of a 1636 grant from the town of Ipswich to settler
Jonathan Cogswell. Although every piece of furniture, every
painting, every plate was carefully selected and documented by the
Littles, nothing was off-limits to the children and their friends,
no room was set aside as a showcase for their collection. Every
room _ even the boys' bedrooms _ was part of their collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful time out there in the summers because it
was a working farm,'' says the Littles' son, Dr. John (Jack)
Little, chairman of the cancer cell biology department of the
Graduate School of Public Health at Harvard University. ``There
were cows and horses, pigs and geese, and hundreds of chickens.
We'd advertise in the Gloucester paper and people would come over
for pick-your-own strawberries and raspberries, corn and
potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that, as a kid, he didn't realize he was living in the
midst of a prized collection. His parents never conveyed this fact
to their children, who thought they were merely living with the
old-fashioned things their parents enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any `Oh, don't sit on that chair,''' says
Jack, who didn't realize the value of his parents' collection until
he was in his early 20s. ``I don't remember them child-proofing
things. Nor do I remember breaking anything. Wait, I do remember
breaking one of the slats on the sofa in the sitting room. And I do
remember them telling us not to lean back in chairs. But there was
never any feeling of being restrained, and my brother and I were
pretty rambunctious kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the house was always full of life and his parents
entertained often, usually hosting antiques collectors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were very warm people so the house was full of
warmth,'' says Jack, who collects antique radios. ``There was
absolutely no sense of a museum atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the only negative response to the collection came from
his son, Fred, when he was 2 years old. He had been put to bed in
his crib in an upstairs bedroom where five large portraits of the
McArthur family from Limington, Maine, hang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard Fred crying one evening, which was unusual,'' says
Jack. ``So my wife went upstairs and found Fred standing up in his
crib crying and pointing to the pictures. Here was this little kid
with all these huge people staring at him. He was frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   As he should have been. For the McArthurs loom large around the
room, and no one is smiling _ even the three children have the same
dour, watchful, and overburdened look on their faces as their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The only intrusion of modernity in the house is downstairs in
the sitting room _ a small television set, a flashlight, and an
alarm clock. Again, these lay exactly where they were left by the
Littles, who spent their winters in their large home in Brookline.
After their deaths a few months apart in 1993, Nina at age 90 and
Bert at 94, the contents of that antique-filled city home were sold
at Sotheby's for $12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   No words can describe the rich atmosphere that pervades every
room of their country house in Essex. The Littles decorated the
house to delight the eye rather than for historic accuracy. They
made no attempt to create accurate period rooms. What they did look
for were pieces with documentation and artisans who were local or
lived in New England. And they were adamant that a domestic setting
was the best way to display their collection; both during their
lives and after their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   They've succeeded. They created an enduring image of our rural
New England past that is now available for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``What truly makes this collection special is that it remains in
its original environment,'' says Peter Gittleman, director of
education at the Society for the Preservation of New England
Antiquities, which was given the house and its contents by the
Littles. ``Also, the Littles had a real appreciation for every
individual object. They loved the history, the tradition, and the
aesthetic beauty of each piece, and they organized them in a very
compelling way. The house doesn't look like an antiques shop. They
created vignettes for drama and to highlight a specific object.''
</P>
<P>
   The Littles, he says, began collecting when people were trying
to restore pieces to the way they were originally created. But the
Littles respected the entire history of a piece, including any and
all 19th-century additions.
</P>
<P>
   The Littles, who were married in 1925, began collecting after
they bought a small, unrestored cottage in Hudson, where they
escaped on weekends from their tiny Cambridge apartment, according
to Debby Griffith, a Cogswell's Grant guide. The cottage had no
plumbing, heat, or electricity, but the couple enjoyed fantasizing
that they were living in the early 1800s. When the couple started
to look for furnishings, Bert's cousin, who had a farmhouse nearby
filled with country antiques, took the newlyweds to local auctions
and shops.
</P>
<P>
   And their love affair with ``country arts'' began.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they bought Cogswell's Grant in 1937, they were
serious collectors. And Nina had become a serious detective. She
kept meticulous notes on every piece in the house, no matter how
small, and when information was not readily available, she pored
through town records, studied account books, and explored church
yards. With the passing of years, she became a well-respected
self-taught scholar, writing six books and more than 100 articles
for antiques magazines. More important, she gave names and
histories to anonymous New England painters, sculptors, and
craftsmen. Most folk art was fashioned by small-town artisans with
no formal training in the arts, and their works were usually
utilitarian in nature. Her husband, who was director of SPNEA from
1947 to 1979, was Nina's able collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Together the couple helped make folk art a subject of serious
academic study. Although many critics dismissed the couple as
buyers of junk, today their collection is worth a small fortune and
treats visitors to a window into the everyday life of rural New
England.

GARDENING AND ART A GLORIOUS COMBINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardening is an art and a science, and practitioners usually
lean to one or the other focus. I enjoy the science of it, but I am
drawn, like a moth to flame, to the art.
</P>
<P>
   I say this because I was especially bad at art in school. I
could not draw (still can't), and theory and appreciation eluded me
into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But the art of gardening cannot be separated and excised. This
is an endeavor that encompasses and interprets the other arts as
well as is informed by and structured through art.
</P>
<P>
   To enjoy the crowded bounty of a perennial border or a starkly
compelling Japanese garden is to appreciate art. To attempt beauty
and balance and meaning in your own garden is to undertake art.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Horticultural Society knows how deeply and
broadly the two are tied. The theme of its next New England Spring
Flower Show is ``Artistry in the Garden,'' and according to Mary
Mooney, show director, there was a fear that the theme might be too
narrow: ``We envisioned four Monet water lily gardens,'' she said,
but when exhibit proposals came in, ``some saw art in the design,
and some in the sculpture, and working with symphony and music in
the garden.'' Proposals were made for literary motifs,
interpretation of art, gardening artistry, and even a Frank Lloyd
Wright garden.
</P>
<P>
   Art and gardening are chicken-and-egg entwined. Early art
depicting gardens gives us a history, if not practical inspiration,
of what was being grown and how. Later art can stand not only as
art, but instruction in color and layout, even exact plantings.
Artists and gardeners, you see, go back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey Repton was a talented English painter who became the
preeminent landscaper following Lancelot ``Capability'' Brown in
the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Repton produced
before-and-after watercolors for his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Also applying art in aid of gardening was the great garden
designer Gertrude Jekyll, a painter whose eyes failed her. Her art
made her an outstanding colorist and led her to strive for unity in
style between house and garden.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous artist-gardener was Impressionist Claude Monet,
who built a garden at Giverny, France, that was his subject as he
explored color and light. Monet collected Japanese wood blocks, and
these inspired the graceful wisteria-covered wood bridge he built
to span the two-acre lily pond he established. In turn, this bridge
and pond became the focus for Monet's art.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Susan Strouse, a painter and sculptor who had a
studio in Waltham, Mass. for eight years and then turned to
gardening. ``I got to the point in my life where everything was
fragmented, so I said, `What do I like to do?''' She likes to be
creative, and she likes to be outside, so now she operates Artful
Gardens, a garden design and installation company based in Jamaica
Plain. ``She also taught an ``Artist in the Garden'' class at the
Arnold Arboretum that I attended this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Strouse took two basic tacks: Paintings can teach garden design,
study them to see through the artists' eyes; and principles of art
can be applied to design.
</P>
<P>
   We learn to look at art, and we learn that contrasting shapes
accentuate form (yuccas and coreopsis, say, or grasses and
elephant's ears). Texture involved shape (ferny astilbe leaves vs.
linear iris blades) and surface (smooth holly leaves vs. hairy
lamb's ears).
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the color wheel, in which the primary colors
red, yellow and blue are separated by the secondary colors of
orange, green and violet. Colors opposite one another on the wheel
provide the most contrast, adjacent colors produce harmony. White
is loud, green is calming, gray is a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through life, I am finally learning art theory and
appreciation. I look at gardens as if they were paintings, I look
at garden paintings as gardens, and I look increasingly at
paintings and sculptures as if they were art and as if I enjoyed
them immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Monet, by the way, had five assistant gardeners. Now that is
inspiring.

CHILDREN OF DIVORCE NEED LICENSE TO MAKE BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the strongest memories Boston University senior Jamie
Levine has of the early days of her parents' separation is the ride
back to her mother's after a weekend with her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about a 15-minute drive. I wouldn't look at him the
whole way, I'd look out the window,'' says Jamie, who was 6 at the
time. ``If I was crying, he'd tell me not to. He'd say, `I hate it
when you cry, Jamie.' Sometimes I would wait to cry until I got to
my mom's. I'd sit at the bottom of the stairs and wail for half an
hour. Then I'd be OK until the next weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   For children of divorce, going from one house to the other and
back again is intensely emotional. The best rule of thumb for
parents at both ends is not to give it short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment when the sense of loss children carry with
them all the time comes to a head,'' says psychologist Sam Osherson
of Cambridge, Mass. ``They see the family that was and long to have
it back. They see the reality of what is, and feel torn in two.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say children who fare best have parents who treat
each other with respect, recognize how important the other parent
is in their children's lives, and send them off expressing
confidence in the other parent's ability to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between saying, `Enjoy your time with
your dad!' and `I hope your father dresses you properly!''' says
psychologist Sharon Gordetsky. The first goodbye gives a child
permission to have a relationship without fear of losing your love;
the second makes her worry: ``Mom doesn't think I'm going to be
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have reason to think your child is in danger,
containing your negative feelings is the single best way to help
her, says San Francisco family therapist and divorce mediator
Isolina Ricci. Her book, ``Mom's House, Dad's House, Second
Edition'' (Fireside, 1997) is a must-read for divorced parents.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel angry, stifle it, says Ricci. If you need to cry,
wait until later; otherwise, she'll think she should stay. If your
child cries, be sympathetic but firm: ``I know it's hard living in
two places. This is your time to be with your dad. I'll miss you,
too, but I want you to enjoy this time. That would make me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even preschoolers pick up on nuances like not inviting the
parent in when it's raining or handing over the backpack with a
grunt instead of hello. ``This makes her think it's her job to fix
things,'' says Gordetsky, who is president of the Massachusetts
Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   While you want to be respectful and civil, you don't want to be
overly friendly; that can fuel reunification fantasies, even if one
of you has remarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10-year-old who insists you walk her to the car instead of
waving goodbye at the door is trying to recapture his family,''
says Gordetsky. During a quiet moment together (not at a
transition), spell things out: ``Do you ever think your dad and I
might get married again? I want you to know that just because we
can be nice to each other doesn't mean we could love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a grip on your feelings isn't just for your child.
Osherson tells of a father whose preschooler tracked mud through
his house minutes before she was leaving for her mother's. He was
furious. ``The anger and loss and loneliness bubbled up at that
moment,'' says Osherson.
</P>
<P>
   The father was sick at heart for yelling at his daughter as he
was saying goodbye, but something good came out of it: The mud
became a literal reminder for him that parting is a time of
vulnerability not just for a child but for a parent, too, says
Osherson, who adds that fathers have a harder time acknowledging
this than mothers. Osherson is author of ``Wrestling With Love, How
Men Struggle With Intimacy'' (Ballantine).
</P>
<P>
   For some parents, the hardest moment is seeing your children
happy to reunite with someone who makes you so angry. ``It's not
that they are glad to be done with you or are passing judgment on
you or love you less,'' says Osherson. ``It's better for your
children to have a relationship with both parents. Be happy for
that, even if the other parent is late with child support.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, you have two transitions to deal with. Your
children have four, and each one has unique characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Parting. &LR;  Some children worry you'll be glad she's gone,
others worry you'll be lonely. Dispell both fears by being
explicit: ``I'll miss you, but I have things planned. I want you to
have fun, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Make preparations thoughtful but not dramatic: ``Is there
anything special you want to take to your mom's? Anything you want
to share with her?''
</P>
<P>
   If a child of any age is clingy or tearful, be sympathetic but
firm: ``I know it's hard to leave, but you always spend weekends
with your dad.'' Disengage once the other parent arrives, almost as
if you're off the clock, says child psychologist Anthony E. Wolf,
author of ``Why Did You Have to Get a Divorce? And When Can I Get a
Hamster?'' (Noonday, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   To the arriving parent, Wolf's advice is to be patient: ``Don't
cajole the child into leaving. Wait in a friendly, non-hostile
way.'' Neither parent should pick up a child who doesn't want to go
and put him in the car, he says. A child 9 or older who doesn't
want to go may be unhappy about leaving friends (see below) or
feeling disloyal about leaving you. He needs your literal
permission: ``I'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Reuniting. &LR;  Children can feel awkward and shy at first,
whether it's been a long or short time since they last saw you.
Establishing a routine can ease the transition, says child
psychologist Robin Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them how they want the first 15 minutes to go. Keep in mind,
too, that this transition can take longer than the literal pick up,
indeed, sometimes several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Older children may intially be hostile. This could be about the
divorce, especially in the beginning, but with preteens, it's more
likely about being taken away from friends or feeling like a fifth
wheel because of a new relationship you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf tells parents with weekend custody to go out of the way to
include friends at your house and to accommodate an older child's
social life. Your new relationship may need to be put on hold while
you are with your children. Tell them, ``This weekend is just for
us; we're not including any of my friends,'' and see if the
transition, perhaps the entire time, goes easier.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Parting. &LR;  ``A child leaving a parent who doesn't have primary
custody is feeling a terrible loss at parting. The more reassuring
you can be about next time, the easier it will be,'' says Deutsch,
who is with the Child and Law project at Massachusetts General
Hospital. Validate his sadness in a matter-of-fact way: ``It makes
me sad, too, but it helps to know I'll see you next Friday.'' Allow
him his tears, but shield him from yours.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Reuniting. &LR;  The reunion with the primary custodial parent can
be so problematic that Wolf calls it the Sunday night phenomenon.
He says children tend to fall apart when they walk back into their
primary house: Preschoolers and young school-age children act out,
preteens shut themselves in their rooms, siblings who don't usually
fight, fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of them as having kept themselves together all weekend;
now they feel safe enough to fall apart,'' he says, quickly adding:
``It does not mean something went wrong or that your child is
depressed.'' His advice is to give a child the room he needs to
decompress, even if it takes an hour or two.
</P>
<P>
   When he seems ready, ask a few general questions, enough to show
you care _ ``Did you have a nice time?'' _ but nothing probing:
``What time did you go to bed? What did you eat?'' To a young
child, those questions raise the issue of safety about the other
parent; to the older child, they're invasive.
</P>
<P>
   If children have a litany of complaints about their other home,
it may be because they think that's what you want to hear. ``They
see it as a loyalty issue,'' says Wolf. ``If they like it there,
they're disloyal to you.'' Again, be explicit: ``It's OK to like it
there.'' If complaints keep up, check out anything that sounds
unsafe or abusive; otherwise be sympathetic _ ``It's hard to live
in two places'' _ but don't feel you have to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   Transitions need to evolve as children do. By the time she was
9, Jamie Levine preferred for her mother not to be in the room when
she left or returned. ``My parents were always polite to each
other, but you could see it was uncomfortable. Once I was old
enough to not need her there, it was easier,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _One way to bridge the awkwardness of the transition is to ask
your child to bring a tape or CD to play in the car.
</P>
<P>
   _Stock the kitchen with her favorite food. It tells her you were
expecting her, that she's not a bother or extraneous.
</P>
<P>
   _No matter which house your child is leaving, reassure her that
if she forgets anything, you'll get it to her.
</P>
<P>
   _Temperament affects how a child makes the transition. Tell an
anxious child, ``I will be here when you come back.''
</P>
<P>
   _Do not use pickup and drop-off to talk to your ex-spouse about
finances, custody, or other weighty subjects.
</P>
<P>
   _If you need to disengage to ease the parting, make sure the
other parent knows in advance that's what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   _Children who have great difficulty making the transition from
one home to the other may benefit from professional help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFTERTHOUGHT  &LR; _ After reading my column on babies' play, some
readers expressed concern about babies playing with wadded-up
newspaper. Toxicologist Michael Shannon of Children's Hospital in
boston responds that colored newspaper may have lead-based ink and
is not advisable for children to mouth.

DRAINAGE TRENCH WILL KEEP STOOP WATER FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My front stoop and steps are of one-piece concrete, which has
tilted a bit so that the stoop slopes toward the house. Water
collects, and it is an ice hazard in winter. How can I prevent
water from collecting? There's a roof, but plenty of water still
collects.
</P>
<P>
   LISA JESSICK, Easton, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The easiest way is to chip a little trench along the stoop
where it butts into the foundation. Make the trench an inch wide
and an inch or so deep, but make it slope to one side of the stoop.
It may not be easy chipping out that concrete, but the trench will
collect the water and drain it off the stoop.
</P>
<P>
   Another way is to apply a thin layer of Top and Bond, a mortar
that can be put on in thin layers, to change the slope, either to
one side of the stoop or to the steps rather than into the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A mason filled the space between the patio and the house
foundation with mortar. It works well in keeping water out of that
space, but he left a film of mortar on the concrete patio. How can
I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   FLORENCE MISITE, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The mason should have cleaned up his sloppiness. But you can
do it without too much trouble. Buy muriatic acid in a hardware or
paint store. Mix equal parts acid and water; always pour acid into
water. Paint this solution on the mortar film. It will fizz up;
when it stops fizzing, scrub if necessary with a bristled scrub
brush, and rinse. Repeat if necessary. Wear skin and eye protection
when working with acid.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a room of pine flooring and another with pine flooring
that is sanded and finished with an oil-based polyurethane varnish.
Now, the unvarnished pine floor has turned a very dark yellow in
areas exposed to the sun. The floor is extremely light, as it
should be, in protected areas. I would expect some contrast, but
not like this. What went wrong? I don't dare do another pine floor.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CHAPMAN, Scituate, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A varnished floor will darken with age, but from what you
describe, this is ridiculous. In fact, untreated wood will darken
with age. Wood will darken with age even under paint.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect it was the oil-based varnish you used. It was either
defective or just one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is drastic, because the floors have to be resanded.
Either change brands of polyurethane or apply several coats (up to
six or seven) of water-based polyurethane varnish, which will not
darken or yellow as much as standard varnish. It is not as sturdy
as oil-based varnish, hence the need for many more coats. I
personally don't like water-based varnish, but I do recognize it as
non-yellowing, or at least less yellowing.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with applying water-based varnish is that every
speck of the oil-based varnish must be removed because the two are
incompatible. It says so right on the label.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am refinishing my wide pine floors. Can I do it with a hand
sander or floor sander?
</P>
<P>
   LYNN JONES, West Townsend, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on the hand sander. A little orbital sander will
not work. A hand-held belt sander will, but it is more work than
using a floor sander. This I know because I did two rooms with a
belt sander, having taken up the boards and done them at my leisure
in a neighbor's garage. Leisure, heck, it was miserable. A floor
sander will do a better job (with either, you have to sand three
times with coarse, medium, and fine paper).
</P>
<P>
   But hope springs eternal, and you might compromise by renting a
square plate sander, a floor sander but without the drum, like an
enormous orbital sander. It can be maneuvered with little effort,
and probably creates less sawdust. It might be a little tougher to
sand the low surfaces of an uneven floor, but with perseverance, it
will work, at much less effort than with either of your other
suggestions. Another good thing about the square plate sander is
that it will get into edges and corners, precluding the need for an
edge sander.
</P>

RAISE A VOICE FOR DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Sprint will soon be given permission to
put up to nine antennas on a water tank in the Swampscott
neighborhood where my older daughter used to live. The matter is
now before the zoning board of appeals where last week 60 people
showed up to protest having an antenna park in the midst of so many
young families. Sprint is planning to pay Swampscott $36,000 a year
for the right to place these antennas a mere 37 feet from the
nearest residence.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was full of Harvard and MIT-educated parents
anxious to address the dangers of radio frequency radiation. Not
one of them was allowed to speak. The only topics open for
discussion were installation and placement because, by federal law,
cities and towns cannot ban these antennas for environmental or
health reasons, even if every citizen, including those serving on
town boards, is dead-set against them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to democracy? How did this come about? Why
would Congress take away the right of local officials to act on
behalf of the citizens who elected them? I'm not much of a gambler,
but I'll bet the answer to that question involves a lot of
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, a piece of
legislation as thick as the Manhattan phone book, filled with
complex deregulation provisions. Hidden deep within its pages, in
section 704, according to B. Blake Levitt, author of
``Electromagnetic Fields: A Consumer's Guide to the Issues and How
to Protect Ourselves,'' was what she calls ``a stealth clause''
designed to seize power from the people. Many of those who voted
for the act were unaware that this section, which had been written
by the telecom industry, would end up preventing citizens from
openly expressing legitimate health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One can only assume that the telecom industry was afraid that if
people became aware of the many studies linking adverse human
health effects with exposure to radio frequency radiation, they'd
think twice before allowing cell towers to go up in their
neighborhoods. In studies done in nine different countries,
researchers found that those living near radio frequency
installations experienced sharp increases in cancer _ brain tumors,
lymphomas, melanomas, leukemia, and breast cancer _ a higher
incidence of infertility, and other adverse effects, including high
blood pressure, headaches, sleep disorders, and memory loss. Such
data has convinced the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health of the dangers of
wireless transmission.
</P>
<P>
   When I contacted Levitt, whose book won an award from the
American Medical Writers Association, she said she recommends that
antennas be sited at least 1,500 feet from residences, schools, and
hospitals. Marblehead's bylaws require a 500-foot setback. When I
asked her what she thought of 37 feet, she replied, ``That's
outrageous. That's criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are we so willing to be guinea pigs for technologies whose
effects we are just beginning to understand? The answer is that we
all share a modern mindset which considers it reasonable to trade
some degree of human health for profit or convenience. We are all
too willing to place the burden of proof on the victims rather than
on polluters. We've agreed to call poisons ``pollutants,'' and when
they kill, never to use the word ``murder.'' By welcoming
everything new without question, we've legitimized human exposure
to harmful substances, like pesticides, without making sure they're
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Zoning officials are afraid that a community which rejects these
towers for health reasons will soon find itself in court, facing an
industry with very deep pockets. However, the Fourth Circuit Court
of Virginia recently ruled that cities can deny a request for
permission to construct a tower because of ``the complaints of
ordinary citizens that the tower will damage the neighborhood.'' In
fact, said the judge, even when those seeking the permit have
``numerous experts touting both the necessity and the minimal
impact of towers ... which may even amount to a preponderance of
the evidence in favor of the application, the repeated and
widespread opposition'' of the citizenry may persuade a reasonable
mind to oppose the application.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Act, he added, should not be interpreted ``so as to
always thwart average non-expert citizens; that is, to thwart
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Congress caves in to corporate pressures, when an industry
tries to silence arguments they cannot counter, when truth is
sacrificed for profit, all that remains is citizen action. I'm
convinced this fight can be won because in Amherst, Gloucester,
Holden, Lexington, Rockport, Sandwich, and Swampscott _ in every
town in the commonwealth where concerned citizens are making their
voices heard _ democracy lives.

FIDELITY MERGING INSTITUTIONAL BROKER GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More changes inside Gary Burkhead's World at Fidelity
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest mutual fund company said Wednesday it was
consolidating its institutional brokerage group from four business
units to one. Three of the four presidents who headed those units
are now looking for new jobs inside the company; 60 of the 1,100
employees in the group have been told they too must find new jobs
in the company or be laid off by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week the retail marketing unit, which also comes under
Burkhead's purview as head of the company's retail business, told
about 30 employees they would have to find new jobs by the end of
the year or face layoffs. Burkhead was named president of Fidelity
Personal Investments &AMP; Brokerage Group just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity said Wednesday's consolidation was an attempt to
organize the business better and not driven by cost cutting. But
those inside and outside the company suggested there could be more
to come as Burkhead continues to remake the retail business.
Fidelity says there are no plans for a hiring freeze, despite the
slowing stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reorganization is designed to get closer to our
customers,'' said Robert Mazzarella, president of the institutional
brokerage group.
</P>
<P>
   The group had been made up for four separate units, dealing with
institutional trading, investment advisers, securities clearing,
and technology sales. The units will be consolidated into a single
business.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McKenna will continue to head the capital markets business.
But the presidents of the three other units _ Ray Marcinowski, John
Mulherin, and Mark Wildermuth _ have been told to find other jobs
in the company.

Reebok repricing options
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for the great stock option repricing extravaganza of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok International Ltd. of Stoughton said Wednesday it would
offer selected employees the chance to exchange their old,
way-out-of-the-money options for a smaller number of options at
current prices and a new four-year vesting schedule. Eligible
employees would be offered four new options for every five old
options under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok executives who are also directors (chief executive Paul
Fireman and executive vice president Paul Duncan) are not eligible.
The company said 3.9 million Reebok option shares would be eligible
for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok shares, which traded at 48 9/16 a year ago, finished
Wednesday at 13 1/8. Many other companies, which use stock options
as an important carrot to retain employees, have suffered similar
stock-price nightmares. More option repricing plans are sure to
follow.

FDIC approves settlement

</P>
<P>
   Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Wednesday
approved a $140 million settlement with creditors of the failed
Bank of New England Corp.
</P>
<P>
   BNE's bankruptcy trustee had sued the FDIC, alleging Bank of New
England Corp.'s banking business had been insolvent before the
company issued new bonds and long before regulators seized it in
1991. The trustee represents bondholders with a total of more than
$700 million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   A US Bankruptcy Court judge still must approve the settlment
with the FDIC. Another suit against Bank of New England Corp.'s
former auditor, Ernst &AMP; Young, is pending.

private banking group of UBS AG, the big Swiss banking company,
until he resigned in August. Gaffney succeeds the retiring Charles
Wallis at Back Bay Advisors.

HAMILL SKETCHES SINATRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WHY SINATRA MATTERS 
By Pete Hamill 
Little, Brown, 185 pp., illustrated, $18 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the early '70s, Frank Sinatra considered writing his
memoirs with Pete Hamill. It was a shrewd choice of collaborator.
Who better than a top New York tabloid columnist to appreciate the
singer who, as Hamill puts it, ``defined the glamor of the urban
night''?
</P>
<P>
   Hamill may have been two decades Sinatra's junior, and Irish
rather than Italian. But there was an affinity between them: a
couple of tough/tender, bridge-and-tunnel guys (Sinatra from
Hoboken, Hamill from Brooklyn), high school dropouts who'd scrapped
their way to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   The project fell through _ the idea of what a candid Sinatra
autobiography might read like is almost too terrifying to
contemplate _ but Hamill came away from it with a deepened
appreciation for the man and some excellent, if scattered,
interview material.
</P>
<P>
   That material is sprinkled throughout ``Why Sinatra Matters.''
The book is a valedictory tribute _ an extended essay, really _ in
the form of a biographical sketch that follows its subject up
through the mid-'50s (struggling Sinatra interests Hamill far more
than imperial Sinatra). Along the way, Hamill also finds room for
such germane, if unexpected, material as a minitreatise on US
immigration in the early years of this century; a lambasting of
Prohibition; and a potted biography of Sinatra's favorite arranger,
Nelson Riddle.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens with a marvelous tableau: Sinatra, his friend
Jilly Rizzo, the great sportswriter Jimmy Cannon, and Hamill
arguing the relative merits of Hemingway vs. Fitzgerald as they
close up P.J. Clarke's saloon late one rainy New York night. The
evening ends when Billie Holiday starts to sing ``I'm a Fool to
Want You'' on the jukebox. That was the song Sinatra recorded at
the nadir of his career and the grimmest depths of his relationship
with Ava Gardner. ``Time to go,'' he announces, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinatra Hamill knew was intelligent and winning: ``a reader
of books, a lover of painting and classical music and sports,
gallant with women, graceful with men.'' Hamill realizes there
could be _ and frequently was _ another Sinatra: coarse,
swaggering, intemperate. That wasn't his Sinatra, though, and that
character is barely visible in Hamill's fine little book.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we glimpse a man who's articulate and insightful _ as
when he describes his first key influence, Bing Crosby: ``The thing
about Bing was, he made you think you could do it, too. ... Every
time (he) sang, it was a duet, and you were the other singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill's Sinatra also has an easy way with an anecdote. ``It was
supposed to be a restaurant,'' he says of the speakeasy his mother
ran in the '20s. ``But it was really a saloon. She didn't call it
Mama Sinatra's, remember; she called it Marty O'Brien's. You're
Irish: would you go to a place called Marty O'Brien's for the
(itals)food(unitals)?''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Hamill gives as good as he gets. It's hard to
imagine bettering his description of Sinatra's looks: ``an
arrangement of knobs and planes that didn't assemble into any
conventional version of masculine handsomeness, but had an enormous
vitality; it was a face that defeated painters and seduced
photographers.''
</P>
<P>
   That final clause is a bit much, nor is it unrepresentative of
Hamill's writing here. Yet this slightly overripe quality
contributes to his book's considerable appeal. Certainly, it suits
Hamill's subject, the singer who made all his own ``the music of
the hours after midnight.''

_A PREVENTION LESSON: DISCUSS, DON'T LECTURE  
 _BREAST CANCER RISKS: THE KNOWLEDGE GAPS  
 _A COMFORTING FINDING FOR CRANBERRY GROWERS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 A prevention lesson: Discuss, don't lecture
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a truism that people are more likely to listen if they are
engaged in a discussion rather than subjected to a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is evidence that the truism, put into practice, may
save lives.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence came from a study of 5,758 heterosexual,
HIV-negative men and women who visited clinics to be tested for
sexually transmitted disease in Baltimore, Denver, Newark, San
Francisco, and Long Beach, Calif. Roughly half the participants
were given one-on-one interactive counseling about how to use
condoms and take other steps to prevent sexually transmitted
diseases; the rest were given brief lectures on preventing such
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The results were dramatic: a year after their visits to the
clinic, there were 20 percent fewer new cases of gonorrhea,
syphilis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted disease in the group
that got interactive counseling, compared with those who got
lectures. The decrease was greater among adolescents and people
diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease during their first
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Social scientists have long predicted that more interactive
counseling would yield more response from clients, but this study _
published in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association _ was the first to prove that counseling can cut the
incidence of sometimes deadly sexually transmitted diseases. The
study also made clear that counseling sessions of just 20 minutes
are as effective as those lasting 60 minutes, which should be good
news for counselors who typically are pressed for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we'd like to get across is that if we did a better
job of talking to people we could have a pretty dramatic effect
with disease,'' said Dr. Mary L. Kamb, a medical epidemiologist at
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and lead author of the
JAMA article.

 &UR; Breast cancer risks: The knowledge gaps
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Education also is paying off with breast cancer, although not as
much as it could, a national survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of women 40 and older, released this week, found that
after years of intensive focus on the illness, American women worry
more about breast cancer than about heart disease, osteoporosis,
and other common ailments. While that is encouraging, the poll also
had bad news: Most women still do not know many of the key risk
factors for the disease, and most underestimate their own risk.
</P>
<P>
   While all women are at risk of developing breast cancer, the
survey found that one in 10 say they have no risk and 67 percent
say they face only a low to moderate risk.
</P>
<P>
   What puts a woman at risk? Fifty-six percent of those polled
stated correctly t hat family history is a critical factor. But
only 8 percent cited age, and just 7 percent named a previous
breast cancer, both of which are key risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance about the illness is especially worrisome among older
women, who are at special risk. Forty-eight percent of women older
than 65 said they face no or low chance of developing breast
cancer. And the older women were less likley than younger ones to
trust their doctors' judgment that they should have annual
mammograms that make it easier to prevent and treat breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discouraging part for those of us trying to tell women
what their risk about breast cancer is is that one basic fact about
breast cancer still has not been communicated: that your risk grows
as you age,'' said Joann Schellenbach, spokeswoman for the American
Cancer Society, which is one of the groups that released the survey
as part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A comforting finding for cranberry growers
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for years that cranberries help prevent
urinary tract infections. Now, according to a study sponsored by a
decidedly interested party, they know why.
</P>
<P>
   It is concentrated forms of tannins, the compounds used to make
dyes, that do the trick, according to researchers at Rutgers
University who published their findings as a letter to the editor
in the current New England Journal of Medicine. The tannins, or
proanthocyanidins, prevent E. coli bacteria that are the primary
culprits in urinary infections from attaching to cells in the
urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   That might be good news for Ocean Spray, the Lakeville-based
cranberry juice maker that funded the research.

THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do Internet users watch less TV? The jury's still out. Indeed, a
new Nielsen survey claims to show that Internetters actually spend
more time staring at the box. Hard to believe _ I've certainly cut
down on set time these past few years.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the Nielsens. The Internet's impact on
broadcasting is far greater than mere ratings points. For one
thing, it's given us a glimpse of the long-promised nirvana,
video-on-demand. Sure, it's lousy video, but that'll change.
Meanwhile, the Internet has spawned a new kind of broadcasting
network that can offer a variety of video and audio programming
unimaginable just a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Internet users already have obtained free copies of
Real Networks Inc.'s RealPlayer or Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Media
Player, the two best programs for tapping into Internet broadcasts.
And soon you'll be able to pave your driveway with copies of
RealPlayer. You guessed it: the software will be included on those
free America Online disks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only thing keeping the Internet from overwhelming
traditional broadcast outlets is lack of bandwidth. Even today's
``high-speed'' 'Net connections aren't fast enough to transmit
sounds and images as good as those on a TV set. Those who used the
Web to watch Bill Clinton prevaricate before a grand jury only
logged on for the novelty of it, or because they didn't have a TV
set in the office.
</P>
<P>
   But in many other respects, Internet broadcasting already has
the edge. There's the on-demand part, for instance. A bunch of Web
sites still have the Clinton video available for viewing; some have
even prepared a ``greatest hits'' collection of the most
interesting parts. No waiting for a rerun or scrolling through a
videotape. Just click and view.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're sick of scandal, the amount of alternative
programming on the Web is approaching infinity. There's live news
from the BBC or CNN, play-by-play audio from college football
games, even on-line jukeboxes where you can punch up a favorite
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Serving it all up are a number of computer networks devoted to
audio and video broadcasting. They're minor players now. But they
could be worthy competitors to the media giants in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the networks you'll have never heard about is San
Diego-based InterVU Inc., 10 percent owned by NBC. InterVU serves
up Internet video, but they don't slap their own brand on the
product. Instead, they provide the videos you can get on Web sites
owned by CNN and NBC, among others. Rather than set up their own
Internet video system, traditional media companies hire InterVU to
handle the messy details.
</P>
<P>
   There is one good reason for lowly consumers to visit the
InterVU site at http://www.intervu.com. They've posted a nice
program that'll automatically download and install nine popular
multimedia players for your PC or Mac, including RealPlayer and,
for PC users, Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Houston, Broadcast.com Inc. has taken aim at the
consumer market. Unlike traditional broadcast networks,
Broadcast.com doesn't produce its own programming. Instead, it
provides a central location (http://www.broadcast.com) where
consumers can connect for free to live news and sports reports, as
well as dozens of radio stations located across the country.
Broadcasters pay Broadcast.com to pump their message to Internet
users worldwide. Lonesome for your favorite Los Angeles radio
station? Broadcast.com has six L.A. stations to choose from, as
well as live police radio chatter for the truly homesick.
</P>
<P>
   So are our PCs about to become home entertainment centers?
Hardly. Instead, we'll see Internet technologies starting to appear
in our TV sets and stereos. Products like WebTV, high-speed
Internet cable modems, and next-generation set-top boxes are
pointing us toward devices that'll have audio and video quality far
better than any PC, while also having the PC's access to limitless
quantities of programming.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, that means we'll have so much more to watch and
listen to than the Big 3 networks or the local radio stations. The
same thing happened in the 1980s, when cable TV took off, and the
broadcast networks have never recovered. How will they cope when
people can watch whatever they want, whenever they want? Stay
tuned.

LET'S BUY SIBERIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a thin line between hope and fear. Six months ago,
financial markets were bustling and there was learned talk in elite
circles that perhaps the business cycle no longer applied. Today,
fear is spreading to the boundary lines of panic. President Clinton
was not exaggerating Sunday when he said that the world stood on
the edge of a ``financial precipice.''
</P>
<P>
   As detailed in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, a global credit
crisis looms at exactly the moment that credit extension is crucial
to restoring confidence. To make matters worse, finance ministers
at the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank were unable to agree on a coherent response to the crisis.
Markets from Hong Kong to New York to London continue to roil with
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation threatens virtually every national economy, including
our own. There is no world government to deal with what has become
a global crisis. Most of what is proposed reeks of throwing good
money after bad. Doomsday scenarios are no longer dismissed out of
hand.The world financial crisis offers President Clinton the
opportunity to fix the problem, completely change the map of
geopolitics, forestall his impeachment by the House of
Representatives and earn him a place in history worthy of his
ambition. All he has to do is call Walter Mead at the Council on
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Mead proposed that the United States buy
southwestern Siberia for $1-2 trillion. At the time, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had offered to sell oil fields, production
plants, and land to the United States to help pay down some of
Russia's then-$70 billion in foreign debt. President Bush dismissed
the idea as crazy and far-fetched, as well it might have been at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   But things are different today. Wednesday, roughly 40 million
Russians joined a nationwide strike to protest years of unpaid
wages and pensions. In the last six years, the average Russian has
seen his or her income drop from $20 per month to virtually
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The near-term outlook could hardly be bleaker. According to the
Journal, Russia's economy is expected to contract by 5 percent this
year. Inflation is expected to reach 200 percent. Federal tax
revenues are collapsing and the ruble's decline in value continues
apace. Russia is a country on the verge of economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Mead's proposal fixes all that with the stroke of a pen. A one
trillion dollar purchase of southwestern Siberia pays off Russia's
debt, stabilizes its currency, upgrades its infrastructure, and
leaves more than enough left over to pay all back wages to every
last pensioner. There might even be enough left over for an
Alaska-style rebate to every Russian citizen, assuming the
kleptocracy doesn't skim more than 20 percent off the top. Support
for the sale of Siberia in Russia would be unanimous. In return,
the United States would acquire a land mass larger than its own,
with a population of 15 million people. ``The combination of new
territories in Asia,'' Mead wrote, ``and a vast, suddenly solvent
market in European Russia would amount, literally, to a new
frontier with new opportunities and challenges for generations to
come. This deal would double our size and put us on the Pacific Rim
at the intersection of China, Korea, and Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more.'' Mead continued, ``Part of the deal would be
for cash and part for credits; with, say, half the money, the
Russians could place orders in the United States. Fiber optics,
consultants, computers, machine tools, whatever they wanted from
whoever made the best deal, as long as the stuff was American-made.
Over a 20-year payment period, we would see something like $75
billion in exports each year to Russia. Minimum. That means 1
million jobs in today's 50 states. Even with all the incidental
expenses _ environment cleanup, infrastructure _ the deal would
more than pay for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Siberia is a land rich in natural resources. Acquiring its
southwestern shank, America would gain the warm-water port of
Vladivostok, the great timberlands to the northwest and all the
mining rights therein. Overnight, we would become the world's
largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
   Running up the American flag over Siberia would create an
opportunity for global investors greater than anything since Asia
in the post-World War II era. No one would invest in Siberia today.
But if it was an American territory on its way to becoming an
American state (or states), a gold rush would follow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson did just such a deal.
Napoleon was in a financial and political jam. Jefferson made him
an offer. The result was the Louisiana Purchase. The Siberian
Purchase makes every bit as much sense.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be considered by the Clinton team. They are
preoccupied with more urgent matters, like the head count on
impeachment. Unless Clinton does something that changes everything,
however, that head count will never add up. The Siberian Solution,
far-fetched as it seems, is Clinton's and the world's way out of a
very bad jam.

BLEDSOE HAS BEEN BLITZING DEFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It doesn't matter if you're Johnny Unitas or
Bart Starr or Dan Marino. When defenses blitz, it's not a
comfortable situation for a quarterback, who is expected not only
to survive the onslaught of huge bodies bent on destruction but to
make a play. In about three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Through four games, the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe has faced
blitzing and more blitzing, a not uncommon situation for most
quarterbacks. The difference is that Bledsoe now can make something
happen even when the pressure is at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Take the fourth-and-6 situation in the first quarter at the
Saints' 37-yard line Sunday. The Saints came with an all-out blitz.
Bledsoe knew it was coming, dropped back three steps, and hit Terry
Glenn on a short slant over the middle. First down.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say mobility is the best weapon in this situation,
but Bledsoe's strength is that he's been able to stay in the
pocket, stand tall, find his receiver, and release the ball
quickly. He's more stationary and sure. No longer are his feet
pitter-pattering in the backfield as if he's panicking.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting more like Marino, who would stave off the blitz and
destroy the opposition downfield.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bledsoe is second in the AFC in third-down passing,
when most of the blitzing occurs _ 28 for 42 (66.7 percent), a
107.8 quarterback rating.
</P>
<P>
   This has been huge for the Patriots, who will likely face the
same type of defense Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our team and the number of guys we have who can
get open and catch the ball,'' said Bledsoe. ``I think some teams
are saying to themselves, `If we just let him sit back, he'll be
able to find one of those receivers, so why not go after him?' They
think if they can get some pressure on me, I'll throw it to the
wrong guys. As it is, I'll usually have a mismatch somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come, I usually have a guy open right away. If I make
a poor play, I trust our guys to come down and make a play to break
up an interception.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe appears to be standing in the pocket longer, thanks in
part to excellent protection. When he does get hit, he doesn't
yield, befitting his status as one of the most durable quarterbacks
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've been hit more after the throw,'' said
Bledsoe. ``It's been an average amount of hits. One big reason I've
been healthy is that our guys are smart enough up front and in the
backfield where rarely will one of those guys come in free unless
he's the guy I'm accounting for and I have to get rid of the ball.
Generally, some guy coming off a block late or some guy who doesn't
have that much momentum, you're not seeing those commercial-type
hits where the ball goes flying and my helmet is twisting off. So
I'm just taking the soft hits, which is why I've been able to stay
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   There are bigger problems this week, which begins a stretch of
three crucial games, including the Jets on ``Monday Night
Football'' Oct. 19, then the Dolphins in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Bledsoe have to watch for Derrick Thomas, who had
six sacks in one game, but he also must beware of perhaps the best
tandem of cornerbacks in the league, James Hasty and Dale Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're facing one good corner, you usually don't throw it
to one side or the other,'' said Bledsoe. ``But these guys are both
good and talented. It's up to our guys to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe again will likely focus on tight end Ben Coates, who can
get open quickly over the middle, and use fullback Tony Carter as a
safety valve. The Patriots are also trying to perfect their screen
passes, which they did last week when Derrick Cullors sprung loose
for a 43-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said Coates, who caught seven passes in the 30-27 win at
New Orleans, will continue to be more involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy, and we felt we hadn't been using him enough in
our offense,'' said Bledsoe. ``We felt we had other guys who could
make plays and we've been using him as protection and as a blocker
_ which is a little bit foolish when he has remarkable takent as a
receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe doesn't expect the Chiefs to show too much blitz other
than on third downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On early downs, they don't try to trick you,'' he said. ``They
line up and show you what they're going to do. On third down, they
get a little more exotic and blitz you, but they have a lot of
confidence in the ability of their players, so they don't have the
need to disguise things and show you strange schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be quick getting rid of the ball every week. With
Derrick over there and with the talent up front, it puts more
emphaisis on me being precise and getting the ball out of my hands.
At the same time, Derrick will be lined up against Bruce
(Armstrong), and Bruce is a Pro Bowler. The last time Bruce lined
up against him (1995), Bruce handled him pretty well. I'm not going
to be able to hold on to the ball because of Derrick's talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas will move from side to side, so Zefross Moss will also
face him, but the Patriots are preparing for that and will likely
use Carter or Coates to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said it's imperative that the Patriots continue to be
effective on first down. Thgat means they'll continue to rely on
rookie running back Robert Edwards, who gained 97 yards on 22
carries against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can run the ball well, that helps us on first down,''
said Bledsoe. If we're second and 4 or 5, then we can play a smooth
game against an aggressive defense like that. If we're second and
10-12 every time, then it gets ugly. Robert is starting to play
like the guy we drafted. He's starting to understand things so he
can play at an instinctive level. He's starting to play with more
freedom. Our running game is still a work in progress and we're
still a passing team and always will be as long as we have the
weapons. Last week we had a lot of effective running plays, and as
time goes on, we'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to be able avoid the two-minute offense because that
will mean the Patriots are well ahead. But this year it's been
money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to score every time we go to our two-minute
offense,'' said Bledsoe. ``So the logical question is, why don't we
go to our two-minute offense more often? You also take more risks.
You're throwing the ball every down, and it's a more risky style of
offense.''

WELFARE STUDIES SEEN CLOUDING DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the results of a welfare study began trickling in
to the Massachusetts Catholic Conference last May, the numbers
seemed startling. Rather than having plunged into poverty, a
surprising percentage former welfare recipients admitted they were
``better off'' after going off public aid.
</P>
<P>
   The study was not made public. The Conference said it decided
not to release the positive results because they were inconclusive
_ not because the organization is institutionally opposed to
welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as December approaches, and as some 7,148 Massachusetts
families prepare to be forced off the welfare rolls, analysts are
bracing for two inevitabilities: a battery of welfare reports and a
flurry of conflicting interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an explosion of information,'' said Barbara B. Blum,
director of the Research Forum on Children and Families at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a huge number of studies on welfare now,'' said
LaDonna Pavetti a senior researcher at Mathematica Policy Research
in Washington. ``There will be lots of differences: the questions
that people are asking are different, the methods are
different...It's going to be very confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since the passage of the federal welfare reform
law _ which put a five-year limit on benefits, shifted federal
funds to the states and killed a program supplying aid to dependent
children _ the business of welfare-watching has expanded
drastically. And each new participant has come armed with a report.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Urban Institute, which is currently in the midst of
a $60 million, six-year study of welfare reform, and which over the
last few years has produced no less than 61 research papers on the
topic. There's the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., which is
preparing more than 20 welfare studies nationwide, at least five of
which are in direct response to the welfare reform law.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the analyses at the local level _ the reports
from the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, the University
of Massachusetts Center for Social Policy and the Department for
Transitional Assistance, all of which have been made public within
the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   In total, in the last two years, the Welfare Information Network
has recorded at least 158 studies nationwide evaluating
welfare-related programs. Of those, 75 came out in the last two
months _ each with its own methodology, population and point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on who is doing the study and what focus group they
are looking at,'' said State Senator James P. Jajuga, a reform
advocate. ``You can turn a study any way you want it.''
</P>
<P>
   That, analysts say, is a refrain on the rise. This week alone,
two studies of welfare participants raised suspicions of bias. The
first, a Radcliffe Public Policy Institute study of 105 women about
to go off welfare, reported that 80 percent will not be able to
hold full-time jobs because they are taking care of children with
chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That result _ an obviously dire prediction for the December
cut-off date _ prompted immediate spin control by the executive
Office of Health and Human Services, whose spokesman insisted that
the system is ``working.''
</P>
<P>
   And it brought criticism from State Welfare Commissioner Claire
McIntire, who accused the researchers of having entered the project
with a bias and having designed questions with a particular result
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it is a collection of stories and not a research
study,'' McIntire said. ``I think they drew conclusions before they
did the study.''
</P>
<P>
   The prelimiary results of a second study, which was conducted by
a team of Brandeis researchers on behalf of the Massachusetts
Catholic Conference, raised questions about whether the project had
been purposely delayed in order to mask the results, even though
the researchers insisted they were simply holding the study to be
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ in which 1,000 surveys were mailed to former welfare
participants _ is scheduled to be released later this month. But in
a letter dated May 1, 1998, two of the researchers indicated the
early results were positive, saying that ``For the most part,
people considered themselves either better off or reported no
change in their lives since they left welfare rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation, of course, is up for debate - as is the
success of welfare reform itself. For now, the steady stream of
studies will be the only constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are multi-state, some are focusing on different
populations...There are a lot of studies. There will be lots of
differences,'' Donna Pavetti said. ``But it's going to be quite a
bit of time before we can say anything definitive about the state
of welfare reform.''

EX-TROOPER'S SUICIDE FOLLOWS FUTILE QUEST FOR HONOR

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ As summer faded into fall, the fever that burned
within Bill Johnson seemed to have broken.
</P>
<P>
   Although haunted by an indelible stain on his police career, he
appeared outwardly happy. Retired in Sandown, N.H., he paddled
canoes on placid mountain lakes and sipped beers with buddies at
backyard barbecues. But still, he simmered.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 50, a highly decorated Massachusetts state trooper, was
a spit-and-polish cop whose brilliant career was derailed, he
believed, by a fateful encounter with mobster-turned-informant
James ``Whitey'' Bulger at Logan International Airport in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his recent don't-worry assurances, his one-man crusade
to restore his record, reclaim his reputation and add honor to his
recent retirement, was slowly consuming him.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives say the former two-time recipient of the
State Police medal of merit, a Green Beret veteran of Vietnam who
sketched his life in regimented tones of black and white, urgently
wanted the world to know that he had been wronged for doing the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   His struggle for redemption tired him out, associates say. And
ultimately it overtook him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' he wrote in a final goodbye to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Late in September, on an afternoon when friends had planned a
cheerful cookout for their down-on-his-luck friend, Bill Johnson,
ever meticulous, wrote out a brief note that contained thanks, the
time of day, and his intended destination.
</P>
<P>
   He walked a quarter mile to a farmer's field _ rolling green
hills framed by 200-year-old stone walls and tall trees turning
pale shades of orange _ and sat down near an oil-stained tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took out his handgun and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy wasn't a troubled soul,'' said his youngest sister,
Jane. ``The human heart can only take so much. He was driven to
this. This was his only way to get some peace. He was anything but
a coward. He fought and fought. In a strange way, he thought this
was the only way to get some honor back.''
</P>
<P>
   Honor and duty were among his family's philosophical heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of six children, Bill Johnson was born Feb. 25, 1948,
to military parents who, like much of America, celebrated the end
of World War II by coming home, settling down, and having children
that fueled the nation's great Baby Boom.
</P>
<P>
   His father, William A. Johnson Sr., was a decorated World War II
submariner. And, like the silent service he entered, he was a stoic
and distant man. His mother, the former Cornelia Doherty, was a
military nurse who was part of the historic D-Day landing on the
beaches of Normandy in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnsons lived in Revere, just outside of Boston, where Bill
Johnson grew extremely close to his gregarious mother, helping her
care for and educate his brother, Charles, seven years younger and
mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   His childhood was relatively uneventful. He played hockey and
football, worked 25 hours a week after school beginning when he was
14. Despite self-described poor study habits, he won
average-to-good public school grades.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a defining moment in Johnson's young life, it came
at age 19. He was returning home from a job in a restaurant when a
car accident propelled him through a windshield, severely cutting
his face. He needed repeated plastic surgeries. His girlfriend
broke up with him. Depressed for months, he left school and
resolved to distinguish himself as his parents had.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted in the Army in April of 1967. After basic training
at Fort Jackson, S.C., and advanced training in infantry tactics in
Georgia, he was began the first of three tours of duty in Vietnam
as a Green Beret, primarily in bases along the Cambodian and
Laotian borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever see the movie `Serpico'? Al Pacino? That was Bill,'' said
Bruce R. Cunningham, who now lives in Texas and was then Bill
Johnson's best buddy in Camp B53 in Long Thanh Province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was a macho sonofabitch,'' said Cunningham, who drank and
raised hell with Johnson during off-duty visits to the barrooms of
Saigon. ``Everything to Bill was black and white. He had a job to
do, and he was dedicated to his beliefs. Bill was a person you
wanted on your side, and he was definitely not a person you wanted
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a radio operator and a weapons specialist, who
participated in air strikes and did damage assessments. Asked once
about the intense stresses of combat, Johnson recalled his mortal
fear that he might stumble and fall while frantically carrying a
villager to safety as mortar shells exploded around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill liked the idea that he was doing a job that was
dangerous,'' Cunningham said. ``He was a remarkable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Revere, Johnson's mother began erecting an in-home
shrine to her soldier-son. His family sent him care packages of
cupcakes and bottles of liquor. He sent home silk kimonos and other
keepsakes from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a hero,'' said Jane Johnson, his sister. ``Everybody
loved him. I remember one year, my mother refused to take down the
Christmas lights on the house for months because she wanted Billy
to come home to see the house all decorated for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson did return to Revere, he found a changed world. He
once told a counselor about being spat upon and called a ``baby
killer'' by war protesters. He felt a nostalgia for Vietnam, missed
the camaraderie of his Army friends, and grew determined to put his
Special Forces training to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy wore his heart on his sleeve. He was the American
flag and apple pie all the way,'' said Robert Cox, who entered the
State Police Academy with Johnson in November 1974 and graduated
with him nearly four months later. ``Duty and honor meant something
to Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Johnson to make a name for himself as a
state trooper. He won a reputation for a street-smart cop, who
relished his undercover work against drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything isn't done by the book, my friend. When you're on
the street, if you don't know your business, you're a dead man.
Billy knew his business,'' said Michael A. ``Mickey'' Casoli, a
retired Revere police officer for whom Johnson worked when Casoli
ran Revere's vice and narcotics squad. ``He was a tremendous street
cop.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of Johnson's two ``trooper of the year,'' or medal of
merit, awards came in 1979 after he pulled an unconscious truck
driver, his clothes aflame, from a burning truck that flipped over
on Interstate 93 in Woburn. The week before he collected that
reward, Johnson was brutally beaten after a minor traffic mishap in
East Boston by a group of men wielding baseball bats.
</P>
<P>
   It was little wonder then that when Johnson won a coveted
assignment at Logan Airport _ where conditions were relatively calm
and the overtime was bountiful _ he relished it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had this famous walk at the airport _ it was kind of like a
strut,'' said Dana Cook, a Massport police officer and a close
friend who worked with Johnson at Logan. ``He would walk with his
head up constantly. He was a proud guy. If you saw him from 100
yards away, you'd know it was him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark-haired and handsome in his dress uniform, Johnson reveled
in his work and was undisputedly good at it. Friends, relatives and
co-workers describe a man who lived by rigid rules. He did not
suffer fools gladly. He could bristle at discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could kill you in 15 different ways,'' his former boss at
Logan, Ed Cronin, now a retired State Police lieutenant colonel,
recalled fondly. ``He didn't take correction well. But once you got
through to him, it was, `Yes, sir. No, sir. Three bags full.'''
</P>
<P>
   He once completely cut off a longtime friendship after a buddy
made a derogatory comment about Johnson's beloved pet, a German
shepherd he named Scout. To his critics, he was condescending and
given to arrogance.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Norman Mordue, a state supreme court justice from
Onondaga County, N.Y., cleared a major Senate hurdle Thursday to
becoming a federal judge for the northern district of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved Mordue for
the post. His nomination now goes to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Lopatto, a committee spokeswoman, said it should pass
easily in the Senate. However, she added that with Congress
expected to adjourn Friday night, the vote may not take place until
the Senate returns next year.
</P>
<P>
   During his confirmation hearing on Monday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., called Mordue ``a great lawyer, a great judge, a great
citizen, a patriarch of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``You're
an example of what a federal judge ought to be and what a human
being ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch added that although he couldn't promise that the full
Senate would approve Mordue's nomination, he believed that ``if
anyone will get through, you've got a pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordue, of Syracuse, N.Y., was born on June 26, 1942, and
received an undergraduate degree in 1966 and a law degree in 1971
from Syracuse University. From 1966 to 1968, he served in the U.S.
Army and received the Purple Heart and other awards for his service
in Vietnam before being discharged as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1982, Mordue served with the district attorney's
office in Onondaga County, first as a clerk, then as an assistant
district attorney. From 1982 to 1985, he was a county court judge
in Onondaga County. Since 1986, Mordue has served on the New York
State Supreme Court in the county.

 UNDATED: ... sizable clump.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _A. ursinum is good in shade and is known as the wood garlic
because it likes damp woodlands. The flowers are pink and the
leaves look like those of lily of the valley. Unlike most alliums,
it has a strong onion smell. Deadhead it or you'll have more than
you want. The seeds have an oil that attracts ants, who drop them
about. If you are overrun, you can fight back by harvesting the
bulbs, which are tasty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
FALL BLOOMERS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are also fall-blooming alliums. These grow from rhizomes
instead of bulbs and must be treated as perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're in active growth all season, their foliage stays
nice and crisp and doesn't turn brown like spring alliums.
Noteworthy among these types:
</P>
<P>
   _A. tuberosum is also called Chinese garlic chives. It's leaves
are edible, while its 2-foot white heads freshen up tired flower
combinations as they weave their way through the late summer
garden. Deadhead it before it goes to seed.
</P>
<P>
   _A. ramosum is Siberian garlic. Its 2-foot purple or white
flower heads bloom in September and October. It will self-seed, but
is a better behaved plant than A. tuberosum.
</P>
<P>
   _A. senescens Glaucum, or German garlic, has blue-gray foliage
twisted into a little whirlpool, like water flowing down the drain.
It has 8-inch tall pink flowers and is often used as an edging
plant, for either perennial or herb gardens.
</P>
<P>
   _A. thunbergii Ozawa is the one to look for because it's the
last to bloom. Its bright violet and red flower heads on 1-foot
stalks contrast memorably with fall foliage. This is the favorite
of Fred and Mary Ann McGourty of Hillside Gardens, a Norfolk,
Conn., nursery that specializes in underappreciated perennials. Its
purplish burgundy flowers with stamens protrude downward. ``In the
bud stage it looks like seven men trying to get out of a boat,''
said Fred McGourty, who plants it in front of euphorbia
amygdaloides rubra, which has purple foliage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BLURRING THE LINE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ornamental allium bulbs are part of the onion genus, the first
plants to be domesticated by man. With these thrifty plants, the
line blurs between the edible and the ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ornamental alliums are palatable, but they're all
edible.
</P>
<P>
   And the genus includes some of our most flavorful vegetables,
including onions and shallots (A. cepa), leeks (A. porrum) and
garlic (A. sativum).
</P>
<P>
   The line gets really blurred with chive (A. schoenoprasum),
perhaps the single food plant with the prettiest flowers. It is at
home in the ornamental, herbal, or vegetable garden. Cultivation is
remarkably easy, even in heavy clay soil. Just divide to propagate.
The standard form is violet but there are many forms selected for
particularly pretty flowers such as clover pink Forescate. Try
dotting it among chartreuse lady's mantle and magenta bloody
cranesbill geraniums, and snip some of the chive leaves for potato
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tastiest ornamental alliums are rosy-flowered garlic
(A. roseum), whose roots are eaten in Mediterranean countries; A.
senescens, which is used as a vegetable in Japan; drumstick allium
(A. sphaerocephalon), which is eaten in Russia; and A. chinense and
A. tuberosum, which are important vegetables in China.
</P>
<P>
   Allium cernuum, or nodding onion, considered one of the most
beautiful rhyzomic alliums, once blanketed the prairies around
Chicago and was a Native American staple. In fact, that city may
have gotten its name from the Ojibwa words ``she-kag-ong,'' meaning
``wild onion place.'' It's easy to grow in sunny locations with
some moisture. The rose-purple, bell-shaped flowers dangle
charmingly in early summer from 1 1/2-foot stalks that lean
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   So give ornamental alliums a chance. They're easy. They're
versatile. And if you don't like them, you can always chop them up
and put them in soup.

STALKING THE ALLIUM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long underappreciated, alliums are finally beginning to get
their due. Most of these fall-planting bulbs are disease-free and
cheap. They don't attract pests, and deer or voles, which love
tulips, usually take a pass on alliums.
</P>
<P>
   The best known is Allium giganteum, which is indeed the giant of
the genus. It produces grapefruit-size globes of purple flowers on
5-foot stalks that give whimsy and height to late spring gardens
and make a big impression.
</P>
<P>
   It's now being rivaled by a new showstopper named Globemaster
with an even larger ball of denser, longer-blooming flowers that
last a month because they're sterile. When they were introduced
several years ago, at about $20 a bulb, you had to take a mortgage
out to purchase enough for an effect. But the price is coming down
rapidly as stock grows, and now Globemaster can be had for less
than $5 per bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Globemaster bulbs often split after the first year, resulting in
smaller subsequent flower heads. You propagate it by digging up and
separating the bulbs after blooming every few years. Or if they
don't thrive for you, renew the planting with new purchases, said
allium expert Mark McDonough of Pepperell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Though these giant early-blooming alliums grab all the
attention, there are many smaller inexpensive alliums, and some
later ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the thousand alliums in the genus aren't bulbs
at all, but perennials growing on roots called rhizomes. Because
these must be bought in pots from perennial nurseries rather than
shipped by bulb companies, they are less common.
</P>
<P>
   Rhizomatous alliums grow in clumps and retain their leaves, so
they can be used like any other perennial. But most bulbous alliums
grow on long, naked stalks with negligible foliage at the base and
require some thought to site. Dotting them through drifts of other
lower-growing perennials is one solution to the problem of bare
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   I use my imposing Globemaster alliums like living topiary. Each
is planted singly in the center of a square of ground covers
surrounded by paving for a formal geometic effect that plays off
the perfect spheres of the alliums.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the alliums you plant in the fall as bulbs bloom in late
May and early June, when a show is needed during the lull between
the end of the tulips and the beginning of flowering perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Most allium bulbs produce globes comprised of hundreds of tiny
flowers on naked stalks with a little fading foliage around their
base. It's that perfect roundness that give them their charm. They
look like lollipops.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of varieties to chose from. Here's some of
the best and most commonly available:
</P>
<P>
   _A. aflatunense Purple Sensation has intense color on 2-foot
stems in early June. Plant them 5 inches deep and a foot apart in
drifts of a dozen or so where day lilies, phlox, yarrows, and other
mid-season plants will take over later. Purple Sensation will
self-seed where it's happy, or the bulbs can be dug up in the fall
and divided.
</P>
<P>
   _A. bulgaricum has exotic clusters of green and white bells
flushed with purple on 3-foot stems. Though a member of alliaceae
family and sold as an allium, it is really a member of a different
genus, nectaroscordum. The seed pods look like something from outer
space.
</P>
<P>
   _A. caeruleum, also known as azureum or blue garlic, has
foot-tall flower stalks that produce their small but true-blue
spheres in May after the foliage has disappeared. They peter out
after a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   _A. christophii _ also known as A. albopilosum, Star, or Persia
_ is widely considered the best ornamental allium, and usually
sells out early from bulb catalogs. The shiny metallic lavender
globes are 10 inches wide though the stalks are only a foot high.
Comprised of hundreds of star-shaped blooms, like the other
``lollipop'' alliums, it adds a touch of magic growing through
other perennials such as sedum Autumn Joy, both when in flower and
after it has dried to a tan skeleton. It prefers a little bit of
moisture and shade; but also makes a wonderful dried flower.
</P>
<P>
   _A. karataviense has 5-inch spheres of white composite flowers
shaded light rose violet on 8-inch stems. The broad glaucous
pleated leaves have reddish edges and are much showier than the
negligible foliage of most bulbous alliums. Like most, however,
they need good drainage and like a sunny hillside.
</P>
<P>
   _A. moly is another very easy allium. It prefers light shade and
tolerates more moisture than most alliums, making it an acceptable
choice for woodland plantings. The gray-green leaves are
attractive, disappearing in late summer, and the buttercup yellow
flowers bloom on foot-high stalks in June. It grows well in dry
part-shade, for instance under oak trees, where few other plants
will thrive.
</P>
<P>
   _A. ostrowskianum is among the easiest alliums to grow,
especially when planted in a dry, sunny spot. This 4-inch-tall
charmer of bright carmine blooms in June. It will bloom well if it
likes its location, shyly if it does not.
</P>
<P>
   _A. spaerocephalon is the popular drumstick allium. Easy to grow
in a sunny spot, it has oval flower heads of reddish-purple on
2-foot stalks in midsummer. As with other ``lollipops,'' it's best
to plant it growing through low perennials such as geraniums so the
stalks don't look too bare. It will build steadily into a sizable
clump.

FINDING THE WIT, LESSONS OF DEPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   The literature of depression is enjoying something of a boom,
which is an odd way of putting it, I suppose. There's no doubt that
depression is proving a rich source of material for memoirists.
</P>
<P>
   Memoir writing in general is taking a lot of heat. There are too
many bad memoirs being published, some critics say, too much
pointless sharing of pain and solipsistic navel-gazing. In some
cases, the criticism is probably valid. But a well-written memoir
that speaks to the reader's experience is a gift. Martha Manning's
``Undercurrents'' is one of these, a beautifully executed account
of the author's descent into depression and her long recovery.
</P>
<P>
   This column is prompted by Mental Health Awareness Week, which
ends today. Of course every week is mental health awareness week
for some of us, whether we like it or not. One of the aims of the
official week is to lift the stigma of mental illness by helping
people understand that it's a disease of the brain, not a character
flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undercurrents'' is particularly appealing because of Manning's
remarkable wit. It may seem unlikely that someone could find
anything funny about depression, but the illness has its absurd
elements, as many who've struggled with it know. Manning, a
psychotherapist and college professor in Washington D.C., kept a
diary. She describes her life unraveling, in small ways at first.
Work piles up on her desk. Her house is so filthy her cleaning
woman is reluctant to tackle it. She can't sleep. She dresses like
a bag lady. She feels overwhelmed by her patients' problems.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, deeply depressed, she checks herself into a
psychiatric unit: ``I sit on my bed, blankly staring into space. A
bassett hound walks by my door. I blink hard. Then two chihuahuas
prance by. A loudspeaker announces that `pet therapy' is beginning
in the lounge. Pet therapy? Jesus Christ, this is worse than I
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's training as a psychotherapist lends a dimension to her
observation of her illness and recovery. The same is true of Lauren
Slater, a psychologist whose recently published ``Prozac Diary'' is
a sharply observed memoir about her 10-year affair with the drug of
the decade. Slater's writing is both eloquent and economical. Her
description of her first responses to Prozac are, as she writes,
``miracle-tinged,'' and she describes them beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Slater's book sheds light on an area that is only beginning to
be explored, the experiences of long-term users of the new
antidepressant drugs. Prozac giveth, but it also taketh away. Those
who use it may lose their depression, but they may also feel that
they have lost all or part of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like Manning, Slater has darkly humorous moments, as when she's
writing about Peter Kramer, author of ``Listening to Prozac,'' and
his notion that Prozac is ``cosmetic psychopharmacology,'' that
makes users ``better than well.'' To Slater, Prozac is, ``the
Elizabeth Arden of psychopharmacology, a veritable chemical
`makeover,''' a word that implies trickery, ``an artful application
of powders and creams to hide unsightly blemishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater has many doubts about the drug that transformed her life,
that enabled her to leave behind depression, anorexia, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. After she began taking Prozac, she
earned graduate degrees from Harvard and Boston University,
married, took a job managing an outpatient clinic in East Boston,
in short, was able to live a ``normal'' life. But she wonders what
happened to her self, her original self, before Prozac. ``How much,
I say to myself, has it cost?'' Her ambivalence about the drug, her
questions about its effect upon her life, make ``Prozac Diary''
fascinating.

HOOKED BY THE Y2K BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines have spilled a lot of ink lately about
the impending ``Year 2000'' crisis _ so much that it's hard to
avoid getting caught up in it. The problem, as you've probably
heard by now, is that many programmers used only six digits to
represent dates in their programs: two digits for the day, two
digits for the month, and two digits for the year. All over the
world there are thousands of computers that think today's date is
981008. Although these programs will work great today and tomorrow,
many of them will mysteriously fail 449 days from now, when the
calendar rolls over to 000101.
</P>
<P>
   Is Y2K a real problem, or is this just another case of
millennial hysteria? When I wrote about the Y2K on Jan. 1 of this
year, I said that the problem was real, but that many businesses
and most home computer users would probably pull through okay.
</P>
<P>
   That column generated a torrent of e-mail from Y2K evangelists _
people who said that I was being irresponsible by failing to sound
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's not much of a problem for the average home PC
user,'' wrote Ed Yourdon, a well-known Y2K consultant, in an e-mail
message to me. ``After all, if the lights are out, the phones are
dead, and the banks are closed, most people won't have time to
worry about whether their PC is compliant or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yourdon isn't an unbiased observer: he's made a lot
of money in recent years writing and speaking about the Year 2000
issue, so he has a reason to play up the potential dangers. On the
other hand, the dangers could very well be real, and Yourdon could
be doing his honest best to try to bring attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yourdon's analysis is pretty straightforward: If there are
sporadic problems, such as a failed power plant here, or a bank
that's gone belly-up over there, then things will probably be okay.
But if problems are widespread or sustained, it could take the
economy a while to get going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's only one or two banks, the FDIC will have no problem
handling it; if it's a couple thousand banks, then it's much more
problematic,'' he says. ``Again, I look at this from a statistical
perspective, and from my experience as a software engineering
consultant. There are 11,000 banks in the US, and they all have a
Y2K project with the same deadline. What percentage of them can we
reasonably expect to be finished in time? Many of these projects
are enormous _ Bank of America, for example, has 1,000 programmers
on its Y2K project. When is the last time you heard of a
thousand-person software project finishing on time? (You can read
more of what Yourdon has to say at http://www.yourdon.com/.)
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, I telephoned Boston Edison and spoke with Jim
Ashkar, the company's Y2K coordinator. Ashkar said that many of
Boston Edison's systems are ``Y2K compliant'' now _ the company's
IBM mainframe computer was recently replaced with a new system that
can handle dates into the next century _ and those systems that
aren't will be up to snuff by July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, one of the most difficult systems to
upgrade was Edison's billing system, hence the need for the new
mainframe. ``We started back in 1993 working on this,'' says
Ashkar. ``We also started restructuring our contracts with our
major business suppliers _ making (Y2K compliance) a condition of
maintenance contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Boston Edison is assuring that its systems will be
Year 2000 compliant by requiring that it suppliers make them Year
2000 complaint. It's then asking the companies to test the systems
and provide the test results as proof that the systems will operate
as expected when the witching hour comes.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison will have extra engineers standing by, if needed,
to man the stations on the night of Dec. 31 ``in the event that we
need to take some additional action,'' says Mike Monahan, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not instead of being ready,'' Monahan stresses. ``And
I would add that, for all of our critical systems, we have made a
commitment not to accept anyone's word for readiness: we will do
(our own) physical testing.''
</P>
<P>
   More information about the region's electrical outlook for the
Year 2000 can be found on the home page of the New England Power
Pool, at http://www.nepool.com/.
</P>
<P>
   The devilish thing about this Year 2000 business, though, is
that what happens over the next 14 months will depend upon people's
perceptions just as much as on the underlying physical reality. If
large numbers of people think that the Year 2000 problem will make
banks fail, and if they withdraw their money as a preventative
measure, then banks will suffer _ no matter whether there is a Year
2000 problem or not. People's reaction to the potential crisis
might cause as many problems as the crisis itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering the era of unpredictability,'' says Peter G.
Neumann, a scientist at SRI who has made a carrier studying the
Year 2000 problem and other computer-related risks. ``The folks who
say everything is under control, trust us, don't worry, are likely
to have egg on their collective faces. The doomsayers also. There
will be lots of problems.... Railroads are reportedly in trouble
because there is no manual backup system and all automatic control
is centralized in a single system.... Air traffic control could
have problems _ (there's) lots of very old legacy software.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann thinks that most banks will probably survive ``because
money is at stake, and money talks.'' But we are in for surprises,
he says, as various Y2K projects are completed and people discover
that different strategies for dealing with the problem don't work
in concert. ``Things that work locally often don't work when they
are linked together with other systems,'' he says.

UNITED WINS REPRIEVE FROM SAN FRANCISCO BENEFITS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge has ruled that the city of San
Francisco cannot force United Airlines to comply with the city's
domestic partners law.
</P>
<P>
   The city had been threatening to end United's lease for a
kitchen and maintenance facility at San Francisco International
Airport unless the airline agreed to provide its employees who have
unmarried domestic partners the same benefits its married workers
get.
</P>
<P>
   United went to U.S. District Court last week to block the action
through a preliminary injunction. On Tuesday, Judge Claudia Wilken
agreed to the company's request.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means that, for now, United can continue operating
out of the facility until the issues surrounding the lawfulness of
the ordinance are resolved. A hearing on the matter is scheduled
for January.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave us exactly what we asked for,'' United attorney
Brendan Dolan said Wednesday. ``We think her action is absolutely
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Aftergut, an assistant city attorney, said he was
disappointed with the decision. Eventually, he said, ``We expect to
prevail. At that point United will have to do what the law
requires.''
</P>
<P>
   City Supervisor Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor of the ordinance,
also wasn't ready to concede defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a skirmish in the battle,'' he said. ``And I think
it's shameful of United to deny bereavement benefits to people who
are deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect June 1, 1997, requires companies
doing business with San Francisco to provide the same benefits to
workers with domestic partners as they give to married employees.
</P>
<P>
   United had a temporary lease with the airport that was set to
expire Monday. The city and United struck a deal in February 1997
that said if the airline complied with the domestic partners law,
the city would extend the $25 million lease for another 23 years.
If United did not meet the requirements, the lease could be
canceled, forcing the airline to find another site off city
property.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge didn't force the city to extend the lease, the
status quo remains until there is a ruling on the larger issue of
whether the law is valid.
</P>
<P>
   United joined a 17-month-old lawsuit by the Air Transport
Association, an industry group that represents the nation's major
airlines. It wants to prevent San Francisco from requiring airlines
to comply with the ordinance. The association contends that only
federal regulators, not a local jurisdiction, can apply mandates on
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wilken issued a complex opinion on the case in April that sided
with the city on some provisions and the airlines on others. For
example, she said that federal law exempts air carriers from the
health and pension provisions of the equal benefits ordinance. The
city, however, contends that the airlines still must provide other
such benefits as bereavement and family medical leave, discounts
and free flights provided married employees.
</P>
<P>
   Those and several other outstanding issues have been subject to
additional litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilken's April opinion did not exempt businesses from other
industries from complying with the law, and this week's ruling on
the United issue doesn't change that. Since the law was imposed,
hundreds of city contractors have begun to offer benefits to
domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   United is the largest tenant at the San Francisco airport and
has more than 50 percent of the passenger traffic there.
</P>
<P>
   United employs 20,000 people in the San Francisco area and
71,000 elsewhere. The company could provide no specific figure for
the number of employees who would be affected by the city's
domestic partners law.

SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES NOMINATION OF NORMAN MORDUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Norman Mordue, a state supreme court justice from
Onondaga County, N.Y., cleared a major Senate hurdle Thursday to
becoming a federal judge for the northern district of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved Mordue for
the post. His nomination now goes to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Lopatto, a committee spokeswoman, said it should pass
easily in the Senate. However, she added that with Congress
expected to adjourn Friday night, the vote may not take place until
the Senate returns next year.
</P>
<P>
   During his confirmation hearing on Monday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., called Mordue ``a great lawyer, a great judge, a great
citizen, a patriarch of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``You're
an example of what a federal judge ought to be and what a human
being ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch added that although he couldn't promise that the full
Senate would approve Mordue's nomination, he believed that ``if
anyone will get through, you've got a pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mordue, of Syracuse, N.Y., was born on June 26, 1942, and
received an undergraduate degree in 1966 and a law degree in 1971
from Syracuse University. From 1966 to 1968, he served in the U.S.
Army and received the Purple Heart and other awards for his service
in Vietnam before being discharged as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1982, Mordue served with the district attorney's
office in Onondaga County, first as a clerk, then as an assistant
district attorney. From 1982 to 1985, he was a county court judge
in Onondaga County. Since 1986, Mordue has served on the New York
State Supreme Court in the county.

SOME `MIGHTY' PERFORMANCES
</HEADLINE>
 - REVIEW-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Mighty'' is a movie that tries to combine
handicapped-child pathos, murderously dysfunctional family
dynamics, knights-on-horseback fantasy, gritty urban realism and
Gillian Anderson in fright makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, tonal consistency is not ``The Mighty's''
strong point. The film does have some nice things going for it,
like a good bead on what friendship can mean to kids who don't fit
in and a surprisingly effective Sharon Stone in a limited but
tricky single-mom part. Even the mildly mystical elements make a
certain psychological sense; young people should read and imagine
more, the film persuasively states.
</P>
<P>
   But despite some finely etched characterizations _ or maybe
because of them _ ``Mighty'' frustrates, well, mightily as hokey
and horrific elements increase toward the end. Amiably odd is one
thing; wackily weird belongs somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the novel ``Freak the Mighty'' by Rodman Philbrick, the
movie unfolds through the eyes of Maxwell Kane. Played by
20-year-old Elden Henson, Max is a junior high giant who,
traumatized when his father murdered his mother, has retreated into
a kind of social catatonia. He rarely speaks, is failing every
class and permits his imposing self to be bullied by punks half his
size.
</P>
<P>
   Max lives in the basement of his grandparents' (Gena Rowlands
and Harry Dean Stanton) low-rent Cincinnati row house. Then Gwen
Dillon (Stone) and her bright, inventive son, Kevin (Kieran
Culkin), move in next door. Diminutive Kevin has Morquio's
syndrome, a condition that retards bone growth. Kevin's legs are in
braces, and his back is bent, but this has encouraged him to let
his imagination fly.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin soon infects mopey Max with his enthusiasms, most notably
a King Arthur fantasy that bonds the unlikely pair through a
transcendent sense of nobility. With Kevin perched atop Max's
massive shoulders, they become towering heroes in their own minds.
But they're still just kids, and when awful reality re-enters their
world, their courage is tested in ways even they couldn't have
dreamt.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could have gotten obnoxiously precious, as it did in
the recent sap celebration ``Simon Birch.'' But Peter Chelsom, the
congenitally eccentric English director of ``Hear My Song'' and
``Funny Bones,'' keeps sentimentality to a remarkable minimum here.
Remarkable because Culkin's motor-mouth performance could easily
have accelerated from puckishly amusing to insufferably plucky. But
even as Kevin's health worsens, the young actor maintains a
psychologically sound balance of self-delusion informed by just the
right, subtle strain of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Henson, likewise, charts Max's emotional and mental blossoming
with convincing vulnerability. He also knows what's funny about the
big lug _ and what makes him dangerous to himself and to others.
</P>
<P>
   Stone takes the adult acting honors. She gets all of Gwen's
understandable angst across in short, deft strokes that leave
little space for self-pity. And there's a genuinely admirable
quality to the way she manages Gwen's conflicting impulses to
overprotect her son and encourage his eager inquisitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   With all this fine work on display, one wonders what Anderson's
sideshow drunk is doing in the mix. And she's just the leading edge
of clashing elements that ultimately upset ``The Mighty's''
delicate, thoughtful balance.

<HEADLINE>
TO BIOGRAPHER, LINDBERGH WAS HERO, VICTIM AND VILLIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A. Scott Berg had accomplished what many biographers before had
failed to do: Secure permission from Anne Morrow Lindbergh to
examine the long-sealed papers of aviator Charles A. Lindbergh and
her own papers, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when Berg first visited the Lindbergh archives at Yale
University, the National Book Award-winning biographer briefly
surveyed the large room packed with materials, then promptly strode
back outside and sat down on a park bench and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God! Oh my God!'' Berg thought to himself. He expected
there would be a great deal of Lindbergh material, but certainly
not that much, and he was overcome by the knowledge that he would
have to examine all that material by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just reading it would consume two years of his life. But not far
into the process, Berg's gloom was replaced by a growing sense that
he was witness to ``certainly the most interesting 20th century
American life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindbergh's life has got everything,'' Berg said in an
interview. ``He was the hero, he was the victim, he was the
villain. And then there was the great mystery about what happens to
Lindbergh after Pearl Harbor, how the most famous person in the
world seems to fall off the face of the Earth. And then there's
also this incredible love story and marriage _ how much more could
you want?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember calling my publisher one day and saying, `I've got
the stuff of a great book, even without mentioning Lindbergh's solo
flight to Paris, or the Lindbergh kidnapping, or Lindbergh's
politics _ just Lindbergh, the man, the husband, the father, the
child.' I still believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg's monumental new biography is the definitive match for this
great material. After almost a decade of diligent research and
writing by Berg, ``Lindbergh'' (Putnam, 628 pages, $30) is a richly
detailed and deeply nuanced examination of a historic life in all
its complexity.
</P>
<P>
   This is this fall's must-read biography, an all-but-certain
prize winner in non-fiction that already is climbing best-seller
lists. Film rights have been sold to director Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Berg refers to Lindbergh as ``a true American hero,'' ``a man of
conviction and purpose and integrity'' who managed to live a life
of accomplishment and consequence right up until his death in 1974
at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who has written biographies of editor Maxwell Perkins and
movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn, knows great lives often have no second
acts, just one singular time that dwarfs all that preceded it and
all that followed. Lindbergh's life, in contrast, is a four-act
drama, with illustrious elements in each.
</P>
<P>
   What Berg is proudest of capturing with this biography is ``the
breadth and depth of Lindbergh's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 48-year-old, Princeton-educated biographer said, ``This
was not just some flyboy who got himself to Paris. This is somebody
who went on to develop commercial aviation, to launch the American
rocket program, to pursue sophisticated medical research. He also
did important work in anthropology and archaeology. Lindbergh is
also someone who took bold, sometimes wrong-headed political
stances, someone who became a superb writer who deservedly won the
Pulitzer Prize and also became one of the most important
conservationists of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lindbergh's luminescent reputation is forever dimmed by
what he said and what he did in the days leading to World War II.
Lindbergh seemed to squander the vast reservoirs of public hero
worship brought on by his first flight across the Atlantic in 1927
and public sympathy brought on by the horrific kidnapping and
murder of his golden-locked infant son, Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.,
in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   This century's first worldwide media celebrity suddenly seemed,
in deeds and statements, both soft on Hitler's Nazi Germany and
prejudiced against Jews, even anti-Semitic. This was the part of
his research that Berg, who is Jewish, approached with considerable
apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I want to spend a decade of my life with someone if he was
anti-Semitic?'' Berg recalled asking himself. ``Will I be able to
wake up every morning to someone who would have hated me, somebody
who would not have allowed me into his house?''
</P>
<P>
   What Berg discovered about Lindbergh was incriminating in some
ways on these matters, but also far more complex than public
perception.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's early admiration for Nazi Germany was the result of
inspection missions undertaken at the request of the U.S.
government to ascertain that country's growing aeronautical
capabilities. He was impressed by Germany's amazing resurgence from
the ruins of World War I, plus the purpose and industriousness
abroad in the land that seemed in such marked contrast from what he
saw in France, Britain and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   So that prompted Lindbergh to conclude (in a 1936 letter) that
Hitler was ``undoubtedly a great man'' who ``has done much for the
German people,'' although ``he is a fanatic in many ways.''
Observations like this got Lindbergh in much trouble later,
especially when coupled with his acceptance of a Nazi medal for his
Spirit of St. Louis flight that was presented in a surprise
ceremony at the American embassy by Hitler's notorious deputy,
Hermann Goering.
</P>
<P>
   Berg believes Lindbergh had no option but to accept the medal,
although he could and should have returned it later, especially
once World War II broke out. But Lindbergh never returned any medal
he received in his life because, as Berg observed, ``he was too
thick-headed, just plain Swedish stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's views of the Jews also caused problems, especially
after a controversial 1941 speech in Des Moines, Iowa. Lindbergh
was the most prominent member of the growing America First
movement, which hoped to keep the United States out of World War
II, a position supported by a vast majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's Des Moines speech included just three paragraphs
about Jews, his only comments on them during months of contentious
debate over whether the United States should enter the war.
Lindbergh thought his comments on Jews were sympathetic, but they
were deeply offensive, including suggestions that Jews were ``not
American'' and were ``other peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg concluded that Lindbergh viewed Jews through a lens shared
by many others at the time, especially those with his Midwestern
upbringing. By some standards, Lindbergh was anti-Semitic, by some
he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to define anti-Semitism,'' Berg emphasized. ``If that
means someone who hates Jews, Lindbergh was not. He had Jewish
friends; he tried to help Jews escape from Nazi Germany. But if
anti-Semitism means someone who segregates, in his mind or
otherwise, Jews from others or from Americans, or someone who
believed the mantra of the day that Jews controlled the media and
had undue influence, then, yes, Lindbergh was anti-Semitic. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased to find Lindbergh was not a Jew-hater. He was
just an old-fashioned, middle-of-the-road, mid-century gentile
anti-Semite.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg's portrait of Lindbergh is full of such challenging
complexities. Here is a great, yet flawed man who overcame a
distant and difficult family; who failed at school and was largely
self-taught; who married a remarkable woman and remained with her
despite their great differences in personality; who was a loving,
if sometimes-harsh father to five children who grew into remarkable
adults; and who always drove himself tirelessly to challenges
beyond the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's worthy life is one that truly teaches by example.
</P>
<P>
   As Berg stressed, ``I cannot think of a single person who packed
as much living into a single lifetime as Charles Lindbergh. I think
one lesson that can be learned from him is the importance of making
the most of our days and making them purposeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other great lesson of Lindbergh's life, and this is
especially timely today, is that here is a man who, right or wrong,
always took responsibility for his actions and his words. That
sometimes got him branded a hero, sometimes a villain, but he
always stood by what he said and did.''

LEARY DISAPPOINTS IN `MONUMENT AVE.'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every city has one, intones the trailer for ``Monument Ave.,''
the new film starring Denis Leary. I'm not sure about that, but I
know that every aisle of Blockbuster has one: a gritty, low-budget
film about a band of small-time hoods trying to keep it together,
their days dissolving into a mixture of alcohol, drugs, fights and
woman-chasing. Directed by Ted Demme, ``Monument'' at least takes
advantage of its Boston location. The tiny, cramped streets, with
the brick row houses, give it a look unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is also the home of the Irish hoods who pounce from one
meaningless petty crime to another _ ``Ladz in the Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   This Irish area of Boston is Leary's stamping grounds (the
comedian grew up on its streets). Sporting projects-trash
muttonchops and looking as if he hasn't had a good night's sleep in
weeks, he cruises the city with a pack of pals, including a cousin
who shipped over from Ireland. Dazed and bleary-eyed, Leary's
cousin doesn't understand the code of the Boston streets: Never rat
out anyone, no matter how much you hate him. It's a plot device,
sure; apparently, in Ireland, the streets abound with innocent
kids.
</P>
<P>
   But Leary's cousin, in his early 20s, is confused, particularly
when one of Leary's buddies is shot down by the local mob boss (the
able Colm Meaney) in front of a bar full of witnesses. And none of
them has a word to say to the detective (Martin Sheen) who rolls
into the crime scene and muses that Boston's bars must have the
biggest johns in the world, since everyone seems to be relieving
themselves in them when a shooting takes place.
</P>
<P>
   It might have made more sense if the kid were bewildered by the
easy violence on American streets, violence that pops out of
nowhere. Instead, he _ and much of ``Monument Ave.'' _ seems to
have been lifted from some old Warner Bros. social-conscience
picture, like ``Angels With Dirty Faces.'' The kid's death is
supposed to rouse Leary from his apathy, but Leary seems almost the
same before as after. Leary works without falling back on his
counterpunching comic rhythms here. He tries to give a
``performance,'' trying to portray a man exhausted from running
around the same track all his life. His aim is touching: He wants
to be taken seriously as an actor, not just as someone who rattles
off wisecracks. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the skills to pull
it off. So a scene in which Leary dares a chowderhead racist to
follow through on the courage of his convictions just comes off as
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad, because Leary's comic persona came as an undeniable
response to those streets; growing up among guys like the hostile,
dim thugs depicted here made him what he is. ``Monument Ave.'' is
at its best when Leary, sitting around and running lines of coke
with his squad, does a speedy enumeration of all the celebrity
babes he'd like to do, and spews out all the reasons he wouldn't
stand a chance with them. The movie damages its own logic by making
the fabulous Famke Jannsen chase him around (although she's
believably angry). Leary and Demme scored before, in ``The Ref,'' a
devious comedy that Leary dominated by sheer performance technique.
By trying to be true to this lackluster story, he commits a crime _
he robs himself of importance.
</P>

CHILI LOVERS WILL BE TEMPTED ... TO SCREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What you're about to read could cause eye irritation, swelling,
certainly tears.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Texas chili lover, you could end up on the floor,
bawling your heart out, grief-stricken as though your pet Chia had
just been hit by a moving van.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to tell you about people who make chili, but not your
normal chili. No, these folks not only put beans in their pot, but
also tomatoes and tofu and ``textured vegetable protein.'' There
are some other things in there, too, but we'll get to those later.
</P>
<P>
   Take a moment to collect yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Sunday, the Fort Worth Vegetarian Society will sponsor
the 10th Annual Vegetarian Chili Cook-off at the Trinity Park Arts
Shelter, otherwise known as the site of Shakespeare in the Park.
Everyone is invited.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $5 to sample the chili. Children are free _ not to
sample, but to take. There will be music, dancing and entertainment
for the kids. There are 20 teams competing in the cook-off. They
have to make 5 gallons of the spicy brew and it must be made
without any animal or dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Take a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this cook-off every year in a different city,'' said
Liz Hutchinson, secretary of the local veggie society. ``Over the
years it has been hosted in Austin, El Paso, Corpus Christi, San
Antonio and Houston. Some cities have had it more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, who went meatless 13 years ago, swears that the
chili is tasty. She is defiant when it comes to putting beans in
the chili. She says there is ``absolutely not'' anything wrong with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, most people say they don't even notice there
isn't any meat in the chili,'' she said. ``Some of the cooks use
meat substitutes, some don't.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the beans: ``I do want to say that chili is just chili.
If you put meat in it, it's called chili con carne. You have to say
it has beef in it because it doesn't come with beef.''
</P>
<P>
   She does have a point. I've never heard of chili con frijoles,
but then I've never heard of chili con tofu either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think chili originated in Mexico,'' she continued. ``I think
they came up with it because they had to do something to season the
beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Hutchinson is right when she trumpets the
health value of meatless chili. No meat means no animal fat, and
that's important to a lot of people. The beans provide the protein.
</P>
<P>
   But about the other stuff these folks put in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they use tomatoes, all sorts of things,'' Hutchinson
said, somewhat reluctantly. ``They use all kinds of vegetables. And
I'm not supposed to say anything about it, but one team I know uses
spinach.''
</P>
<P>
   Good God!
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Hutchinson really didn't want to say it, I think.
But she's a nice woman and I asked. ``What else do they use?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanut butter,'' she answered. ``Isn't that incredible? A
woman used peanut butter, and she won. She's coming again this
year, and she's bringing the peanut butter again.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that it can be done, Hutchinson offered the
following recipe. Try it if you wish. But it might be wiser to go
to the vegetarian chili cook-off and get professional help before
attempting it on your own.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, for example, doesn't specify chunky or creamy.

`WITHOUT LIMITS' IS LATEST FILM BIO OF RUNNER STEVE PREFONTAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oregon long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine broke a number of
records in the late '60s and early '70s, made a strong showing (but
didn't place) in the ill-fated 1972 Munich Olympics and died in an
alcohol-related automobile accident in 1975 at age 24.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a special star quality, he attracted a huge fan
following during his life and his legend has inspired a noted
television documentary and last year's Disney-produced biopic,
``Prefontaine,'' which was filmed partly in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' is yet another movie biography, and its
credentials are a bit more impressive. It was co-produced by
superstar Tom Cruise and written and directed by Robert Towne, who
is generally regarded as the most important Hollywood screenwriter
of the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this second Prefontaine biopic is the better
of the two features. The performances are strong, the running
sequences are gripping (even when you know the outcome), and many
of the scenes sparkle with the celebrated Towne wit and subtext.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it fails to be a great sports drama. In the end, it's not
too much more successful than its predecessor in communicating why
this cocky runner _ who stubbornly refused to take coaching, who
never even won a bronze medal _ is so worthy of our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Towne's script (co-written with Olympic runner Kenny Moore)
tells basically the same story as the last film: a confident boy
from a lower-middle-class, German-speaking Coos Bay, Ore., family
becomes the crowd-pleasing, record-setting star of the University
of Oregon's track team, comes up empty-handed in the '72 Olympics,
develops some valuable self-awareness but dies young.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the drama of Towne's script rises out of the conflict
between Pre's insistence on ``front-running'' or maintaining the
lead of the pack of runners _ always giving his utmost _ and his
coach's efforts to teach him that it's often possible to win a
race, with a smarter, more calculated effort. It's a conflict
that's never quite resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The film benefits from an unusual and highly charismatic
performance by Billy Crudup as Prefontaine. Because he's a terrific
actor and a strong star presence, and because's he's not well
known, he's able to uncannily blend into the role and become one
with the character. When, in his best scene, he calmly tells his
coach that running is ``an art form'' it's genuinely thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Equally moving is Donald Sutherland as his long-suffering coach,
the famous Bill Bowerman, who would become even better known as the
founder of Nike running shoes. Sutherland's range of feelings about
Pre _ affronted dignity, grudging admiration, fatherly love _ are
subtly but perfectly expressed, and his final eulogy scene is a
masterful piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the film's numerous running scenes are always well
handled; as is the touching, unconsummated love story between Pre
and the Oregon co-ed (Monica Potter) who strains to understand him.
It also scores some emotional points against the hypocrisy of
``amateur'' sports, and the exploitation of the AAU in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But, as good as it is in places, ``Without Limits'' fails to be
a totally satisfying biography or a riveting competition drama. It
never communicates a clear vision of its hero's existential
mind-set or makes a clear case for his unique contribution to his
sport. It's hard to even know, from the evidence of the film, if
its title is ironic or not.
</P>
<P>
   Since these were some of the failings of the first Prefontaine
film, one wonders why Towne and Cruise would go to the trouble to
make another film and not do a better job of filling in the blanks.
In the end, neither of the films is half as informative or
effective as ``Fire on the Track'' _ the stirring TV documentary
that reportedly inspired both films, but was credited by neither.
</P>
<P>
   Without Limits. Directed by Robert Towne. Written by Robert
Towwne and Kenny Moore. Produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner.
Cast: Billy Crudup, Donald Sutherland, Monica Potter. Warner Bros.
118 minutes. Rated PG-13 for brief sexual material and brief strong
language.

CLINTON'S NOT ALONE IN WORK-PLACE DALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently, President Clinton isn't the only one caught in an
office romance.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic encounters at the office are at an all-time high, which
may explain why some Americans aren't shocked by Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   With the huge increase in women in the work force, the
increasing time spent at the office and a loosening of relationship
rules in corporate America, office affairs number in the millions,
attorney Dennis M. Powers says.
</P>
<P>
   He discusses the trend and its implications, especially in
respect to sexual harassment laws, in ``The Office Romance: Playing
With Fire Without Getting Burned'' (Amacom, 316 pages, $22.95.)
</P>
<P>
   How big are the numbers? Huge.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1994 American Management Association study, 80
percent of managers surveyed have had or known of an office
romance. Other surveys suggest that between 25 percent and 33
percent of employees have had an office romance. A study by the
Bureau of National Affairs suggests that one-third of all
relationships started at or from work. And that study was conducted
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those number are astounding considering that 20 years ago, most
companies had nepotism and favoritism rules to keep married couples
from working together, Powers writes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 84 percent of companies surveyed said they allow
husband-wife teams. Some companies even encourage the policy. A
whopping 98 percent of companies surveyed permit workers to date.
</P>
<P>
   Powers sees the trend as natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge time demands placed on everyone by their employers
have made work the only place to meet people for vast numbers of
Americans,'' Powers writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add in the opportunity to work closely with someone
at no risk, view them in all types of settings, and be with someone
of similar expectations and education, then you can easily see why
work has become the meeting and dating place of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many office encounters are more than just sexual flings.
One-half of survey respondents who acknowledged having an office
romance said they ended up in a marriage or long-term relationship,
according to the management association study. That beats the
overall divorce rate, which is up to 60 percent, according to the
Council on Families in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats singles bars, blind dates and personal ads, and any
chemistry is given the time to become hotly seasoned,'' Powers
writes. ``These benefits are not one-sided: businesses now are
recognizing the direct link between employee job satisfaction and
company profits with prointeractive policies.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside to such romantic encounters, and Powers
includes chapters on sexual harassment laws and what happens when a
relationship ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the former, however, Powers argues that most office
relationships never see the light of an Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission file.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 54,000 sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC
over the past six years, less than 5 percent involved a failed
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Yet dangers do exist, and Powers has identified 10, from damaged
professional reputations to conflicts of interest to facing your
ex-lover at work every day. The author draws not only from surveys
and studies, but also extensively quotes the experiences of
individuals, using first names only.
</P>
<P>
   Powers also scrutinizes what companies are doing about the
trend. In some respects, companies dance on a tight rope.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, said Burke Stinson, AT&AMP;T's senior public relations
manager:
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to lose your best employees because they're
having a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other, companies don't want to be involved in sexual
harassment cases or other illegal issues, or in tense and therefore
unproductive environments resulting from failed affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Powers suggests office policies that do not stand in the way of
the inevitable relationships, yet carefully spell out what is
acceptable and what is not.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Powers skillfully guides readers through the land mines
and windfalls of a trend that is clearly permanent.

DERIVATIVE `MONUMENT AVE.' IS A DEAD END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The air of deja vu is so heavy in ``Monument Ave.'' that it
often plays like a caricature of that most overworked formula of
the American Independent Cinema: the ``Mean Streets'' clone.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old story about a group of boyhood pals who grow up
together in some troubled inner-city neighborhood, move inevitably
into crime and the underworld as adolescents, and end up badly as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the streets are in the Irish American ghetto of South
Boston, and the hero is Bobby (Denis Leary), a thirtysomething car
thief and low-level hoodlum who still lives at home with his mother
(Marilyn Murphy Meardon).
</P>
<P>
   His pals are: Mouse (Ian Hart), a burglar so lazy and stupid he
tends to fall asleep in the apartments he robs; Digger (John
Diehl), a seedy taxi driver who chaufeurs the rest of the guys
around; and Teddy (Billy Crudup), a speed freak just out of stir.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the stock characters are Jackie (Colm Meaney), the
affable but deadly leader of the local Irish mafia; Hanlon (Martin
Sheen), the Irish cop who tries to help the boys go straight; and
Katy (Famke Janssen), the tough girl with a heart of gold who loves
Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackie has Teddy gunned down (because he may have ratted on
Jackie in prison), it brings a crisis into Bobby's life. Is he
going to swallow the death of his pal and stay safe, or is he going
to make a stand against the vicious gang leader?
</P>
<P>
   The script never makes us care one way or another. Anyway, it's
too busy entertaining us with offensive macho humor and
Tarantino-esque torture scenes, as when Bobby and the guys kidnap,
brutalize and nearly murder an innocent black man who happens to
inadvertently wander into their all-white neighborhood one night.
</P>
<P>
   In the lead, Denis Leary _ unappealing in the best of times _ is
like so much dead air on the screen. His character not only has no
redeeming qualities at the start, he displays no spiritual growth
in the course of the film. There's nothing about the guy to make
anyone want to invest an ounce of interest or sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Even more glaring, director Ted Demme (``Beautiful Girls'')
seems to have no special ``feel'' for this milieu; he never gives
his audience the sense it's getting a privileged look inside a
brutal world that he knows very well. Instead, ``Monument Ave.'' (a
title that goes unexplained in the film) always comes across as a
compilation of regurgitated moments from other, better movies.
</P>
<P>
   Monument Ave. Directed by Ted Demme. Screenplay by Mike
Armstrong. Cast: Denis Leary, Ian Hart, Famke Janssen, Billy
Crudup, Martin Sheen, Colm Meaney. Lions Gate Films. 90 minutes.
Unrated.

A POWERFUL TALE OF OLYMPIAN ARROGANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' chronicles an aspect of American life we
don't often see in the movies: the quality of earned arrogance.
Steve Prefontaine, as played by Billy Crudup, has a brand of
spiritual superiority that manifests itself as a physical
arrogance: His proud walk, which shows off his supreme belief in
himself. As the premier U.S. long-distance runner of the early
1970s, Pre, as he's called, believes the world is his oyster _ his
plate of oysters _ and he downs them at his leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup makes the cockiness winning, a simple reflection of Pre's
absorption in his athletic performance. He may be arrogant, but
he's a generous guy. As we see in his courtship of the student
played by Monica Potter, he can even be old-fashioned and courtly.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Robert Towne is more interested in the tests
that Pre subjects himself to than the races in which he competes.
This may not make for the fiercest melodrama, but it does serve as
an ingenious way to set his actors loose. Especially Donald
Sutherland, who has spent most of the past two decades playing
oversensitive sufferers. As Pre's coach, Bill Bowerman, Sutherland
holds his head up and regards the world as his oyster, too, and
plucks Pre as his pearl. It's a battle of arrogance, and
Sutherland's casual preening is devastating. He shows a control
that's been missing from his work.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Pre and Bowerman wrestle for psychological supremacy is
funny, because both men have towering levels of eccentricity.
Bowerman, at work on what would become the standard in running
shoes _ he was out to design a sole that didn't need metal spikes,
so that it would be lighter and faster _ turns his kitchen into a
novelty store, pouring up batches of rubber into waffle irons and
slapping the homemade soles on shoes; the place looks like some
peculiar cobbler elf's factory.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, though, the material feels underdramatized. However,
Towne outdoes himself as a writer. He has directed two previous
movies, ``Personal Best,'' which also followed athletes in their
downtime, and ``Tequila Sunrise,'' a romantic melodrama. Those
movies captured a kind of arrested adolescence, and it was less
forgivable in ``Sunrise.'' In ``Without Limits,'' by dealing with
so many themes, he doesn't take the time to explicate them properly
and play them out throughout the film. Had he made the struggle
between Bowerman and Pre a little harder and sharper, he might have
given the movie more focus.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, though, that he was hamstrung partially by
choosing a living subject in Bowerman and not wanting to cause him
any pain. (In some ways, with his cool curiosity, Sutherland seems
to be playing Towne.) The performances have a lithe, muscular
power. And there's a funny edginess that Towne has given to the
mating match between Potter and Crudup. He's tickled by her
independence _ she has a strong sense of morality, and of herself _
and it draws him to her. Like a number of other things in the film,
their relationship doesn't quite pay off (she, too, plays someone
who's still living, which must have presented a problem in her
depiction). But Towne shows such a savvy and delicate touch as a
director that stuff from the movie sticks with you, like lines from
a great pop song.

`HOLY MAN' CONTINUES EDDIE MURPHY SUCCESS WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy continues to ride his recent success wave with
``Holy Man.'' It's a better-than-average comedy that actually has a
lot to say about how we live (or how we think we should live).
</P>
<P>
   In an odd way, it's an apt companion to the recent ``The Truman
Show'' in that its protagonist spends much of his life with
television and comes to find chronic dissatisfaction with old
habits when faced with real love and responsibility. In this case,
the conduit to a better future is an itinerant holy man named ``G''
(Eddie Murphy).
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Hayman (Jeff Goldblum) was once the top sales executive
for the Good Buy Shopping Network (GBSN) but he's taken a down turn
in the past ``27 months of flatness'' and his new boss, Mr.
McBainbridge (Robert Loggia) is scouting for new blood. Ricky is up
to his ears in debt and the bank is calling daily because his car
payment bounced and he hasn't enough money to pay the mortgage on
his tony Miami pad.
</P>
<P>
   McBainbridge hires a media analyst, Kate Newell (Kelly Preston),
to weigh the station's financial woes and Ricky, who is aware he
may soon be unemployed, makes his play. But Kate's too savvy. One
day, while driving back from lunch, they have a flat tire. Out of
nowhere comes a ``guy wearing his pajamas'' named G, who is on a
spiritual pilgrimage and who realizes Ricky is on a spiritual
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, G and Kate have become good friends, and the guru
has moved into Ricky's home. Ricky has an idea to put the prophet
on the air to boost sales and make a different kind of profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about making people feel they have to have things even
when they don't want them,'' Ricky tells G. But G has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the conflict of innocence and spiritual inner peace
versus the emptiness of money and greed, ``Holy Man'' sidles
through several shifts in tone before it settles for a maudlin
ending that undercuts the potency of its earlier message. It's a
shame the film fumbles at times, and wavers in what it wants to
convey _ ultimately, its payoff is flimsy after such an
enlightening lesson in values.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the idea of a drowning man who is all too aware that
``everybody is anxious and scared; we acquire and waste,'' and who
can't save himself, has been a staple in the movies. ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' and Disney movies like ``Down and Out In Beverly
Hills'' used angels and bums, respectively, to rescue their
floundering film heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Man'' was written by Tom Schulman, who also wrote ``Dead
Poet's Society,'' and his strength as a screenwriter is the ability
to show the vulnerability in his all-too-human protagonists.
Goldblum has just the right mix of strength and weakness to allow
us to initially dislike Ricky's fake, oozy charm, but to see the
growth that comes after meeting G.
</P>
<P>
   Preston's Kate is really the catalyst for Ricky's change because
she's already in tune with her own spirituality; and Murphy, who is
calmly charismatic, imbues his holy man with a weird dignity that
balances the scales between Ricky's pain and Kate's peace.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Man. Directed by Stephen Herek. Written by Tom Schulman.

`THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS': BONDS THAT FLOURISH IN THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
(kd) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This year's New York Film Festival concludes on a
note of uncommon grace. ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' to be shown on
Sunday night at 8:30, begins simply and becomes a glimpse into an
unexpected world. Though its two main characters, young Frenchwomen
adrift and living hand to mouth, are rough-edged and scrappy, they
wind up forming a bond of enormous delicacy. As that bond frays,
this impassioned first feature by Erick Zonc reveals a soulful,
moving vision of our shared responsibility for one another's lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a film whose two stars jointly won best actress honors at
Cannes this year, the most immediately unforgettable figure is
Elodie Bouchez's Isa (short for Isabelle). At 21, she's a scruffy
opportunist toting her backpack through Lille, raising pocket money
by hustling religious pictures to passers-by. She takes a factory
job as a seamstress, failing dismally but winding up with a fellow
worker, Marie (Natacha Regnier) as her new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Marie couldn't care less about being a seamstress either. In a
film that easily incorporates class struggle into its story and
cares more about working-class experience than many a more openly
political drama, she too lives strictly in the moment. Both woman
are at an adventurous age, looking for opportunity wherever they
find it and working only because they must. Then with the lovelorn
blindness of a Dreiser heroine, Marie hitches her hopes to a
wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   Zonca, who cares more about emotional fire than social realism,
depicts Marie's love affair with furious intimacy. It begins in a
most unexpected way. Isa and Marie have been happily taunting
bouncers at a club, mostly just for sport; Marie even has an affair
with one of them (a hefty biker, played with incongruous tenderness
by Patrick Mercado). The women have also harassed smug-looking
Chris (Gregoire Colin), without realizing that he is the club's
owner. One day Chris spots slim, pretty Marie while she is
shoplifting a jacket and saves her from arrest. Rebellious but also
secretly impressed, Marie lets Chris buy the jacket and buy her,
too.
</P>
<P>
   With her big, toothy grin and rough features, Ms. Bouchez's Isa
looks like the plainer of the two women at first. But as she rises
to the occasion of befriending the badly confused Marie, she takes
on an astonishing radiance, a glow of stirring compassion. ``She
gave out an impression of serenity, grace and absolute confidence
in life,'' Zonca has said of the young woman who inspired this
story, and the luminous Ms. Bouchez (whose credits include Andre
Techine's ``Wild Reeds'') summons that same spirit magnificently
here. In the subplot from which the title comes, Isa learns of a
comatose young girl (whose apartment she and Marie happen to be
sharing) and avidly makes herself the girl's guardian, sharing in
her fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' escalates with frightening urgency
as Marie loses her bearings. Wise in the ways of stubbornly
wrongheaded love affairs, Zonca shows how sexually responsive she
is to Chris' cruelty, and how easily sexual desperation drives a
wedge between the friends when Isa counsels caution. In scenes of
tumultuous intimacy, he watches the two feisty heroines fight out
their differences. The two actresses perform with overwhelming
naturalness, as if utterly locked into this conflict. Zonca had
them live together while making the film, and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this beautifully acted drama, as raw and immediate
as it is heartfelt, describes much more than the fallout from
friendship or a headstrong love affair. It leaves behind what Isa
has discovered: the profound ties among the lives that are seen
here, and the way those ties make sense of our world.

`THE MIGHTY': TALENTS TO MAKE BUDDIES _ WALKING AND WISECRACKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review.) 
(kd) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   The young-adult novel ``Freak the
Mighty'' by Rodman Philbrick has been renamed ``The Mighty'' for a
more inspirational effect on screen. Still, it's mostly a story for
the age group that would find ``Freak'' the most enticing word in
the title. In this fanciful but tragic tale, the outsider status of
two boys is what creates their sense of specialness, helps them
defeat obstacles and gives them a proudly medieval way of dealing
with the world. Only when that world looks bleak does the story
earn its hankies for adults in the crowd.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The odd-couple union between big, hulking Maxwell Kane (Elden
Henson) and his disabled next-door neighbor, Kevin Dillon (Kieran
Culkin) is at the heart of the story. By the standards of quirky
tales like ``Freak the Mighty,'' this is not an unlikely pairing.
It's pure kismet when these two find each other, since Kevin is
smart and wisecracking in ways that make Max feel less obtuse, and
Max can walk. Kevin is locked in leg braces and has a disease that
will shorten his life. A friend of Philbrick's had a son born with
Morquio's syndrome, the degenerative condition described here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mighty'' doesn't dwell on the morbid, since it is directed
by Peter Chelsom (``Hear My Song,'' ``Funny Bones'') and Sharon
Stone is Kevin's noble mom. Dressed as just folks, Ms. Stone
brightens the movie without seeming like anyone who would cook a
Christmas turkey with Pat Boone singing ``Jingle Bells'' in the
background. (Songs on the soundtrack are sometimes intrusive.) Ms.
Stone gives a game, down-to-earth performance until the dialogue
protests too much. (``Kevin lives in this world of books and words
and ideas, things I don't even understand!'')
</P>
<P>
   The boys themselves are played likably and well, although some
of the adult roles pose more of a problem. While Gena Rowlands and
Harry Dean Stanton appear amusingly as grandparents a la ``American
Gothic,'' Gillian Anderson plays a floozy named Loretta and does
what can most flatteringly be described as a stretch. Meat Loaf and
James Gandolfini figure in a menacing, trumped-up subplot about
Max's past.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsom makes his first American film without as much sweet
whimsy as his earlier films displayed. But his sense of visual
enchantment easily accommodates the boys' preoccupation with all
thing Arthurian and the story's way of letting dreams of knighthood
loom large and literal from time to time. From the directorial
standpoint, this was no easy task.
 &UR; PRODUCTION NOTES: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mighty'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes profanity and mild violence

`BAD MANNERS': MAKES A VIPERS' NEST LOOK DOWNRIGHT COZY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review.)

 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't allow smoking in my house, and I don't appreciate
having an antique incense burner used as an ashtray,'' snaps Wes
Westlund (David Strathairn), an embittered, prissy academic, to Kim
Matthews (Caroleen Feeney), his seductive chain-smoking house
guest, in Jonathan Kaufer's pitch-black comedy ``Bad Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim is a piece of work by any definition. A game theorist and
computer scientist accompanying her musicologist-boyfriend, Matt
Carroll (Saul Rubinek), to Cambridge, Mass., she sees all human
relations as a diabolical power game. It isn't long before she is
cruelly pelting Wes and his sexually unfulfilled wife, Nancy
(Bonnie Bedelia), with humiliating questions about why they don't
have any children.
</P>
<P>
   What are these four people doing in the same house together?
Well, many years ago, Matt and Nancy were a couple. Now Matt, who
has since gained 40 pounds, has returned to Cambridge with Kim to
give a lecture and meet with an editor about the publication of his
exciting new research on the work of a Vietnamese electronic
composer.
</P>
<P>
   Matt is beside himself with excitement after having discovered a
fragment of ``A Mighty Fortress Is Our God'' buried in the fabric
of one of his pet composer's randomly determined electronic
compositions. How did it get there? Was it an accident? Did God
miraculously place it there? Or was the software program used to
produce the piece somehow tampered with?
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of the hidden musical quote coincides with a more
mundane and mean-spirited drama that torments this unhappy foursome
during their weekend in hell together. After his first clash with
Kim, Wes discovers a $50 bill missing from his wallet. He is so
certain that she stole it that he pressures his wife to rummage
through Kim's luggage, where Nancy indeed discovers such a bill
secreted in a compact. But is it the same bill? That's only the
beginning of the sophisticated truth-or-dare inspired games of
accusation and denial that the two couples play with the intensity
of high-stakes poker players.
</P>
<P>
   Why these people would choose to spend more than half an hour,
let alone an entire weekend, in one another's company after the
first salvos have been fired is anybody's guess. But if they didn't
obsessively try to outsmart one another, there would be no movie.
By the end of the film, the stakes escalate from stolen $50 bills
to the very foundations of trust on which their relationships are
based.
</P>
<P>
   Comic viciousness and sexual and intellectual humiliation and
one-upmanship are the sum and substance of this nasty parlor game
of a film, adapted by David Gilman from his play ``Ghost in the
Machine.'' Although the movie aspires to be a late-90's cyber-wise
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' it lacks the overriding
humanity of Edward Albee's scabrous orgy of booze-fueled insults
and anguished truth-telling. People, not even those who spend 12
hours a day straining their eyes in front of a computer screen
analyzing game theory, aren't this gratuitously vicious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad Manners'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or guardian). It has sexual situations, nudity and strong
language.

LISTENING TO THE SPEWINGS OF BROTHER MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just for the irony of it, I have rechristened the anonymous
caller ``Brother Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I must have received hundreds of calls like the
one Brother Man left on my voice mail, and I've learned to dismiss
them as the putrid waste products of disadvantaged minds that they
are.
</P>
<P>
   When an old-style crude bigot (not one of the more sophisticated
post-Reagan-era types) starts in laying that ludicrous spiel on me,
I usually either hang up abruptly or find a way to put the creep in
his or her place with humor.
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail has become a really handy device for pusillanimous
bigots. They can put in test calls to determine if the callee is
available. If not, they then regurgitate into one's recording
device.
</P>
<P>
   Usually I just erase the stuff after the opening flatulence. But
in Brother Man's case, I listened to the whole odious oration. I
suppose I did that because I hadn't heard anything quite like it in
a while, and I was amazed to find that there were still some of
those old-fashioned hate-mongers around who let fly with
unvarnished racial malice.
</P>
<P>
   These days, most people who really feel the way Brother Man does
usually coat their vocalized feelings with a thin veneer of
civility. But those are the educated or semi-educated ones.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could have been that Brother Man was not as
ignorant as I first presumed. Maybe he was a fairly well-schooled
person who became so incensed at my column of that day, which
lambasted one of his favorite far-right ideologue politicians, that
he decided to cast civility to the winds and let it all hang out
... to my machine.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, I surmised, he is a good friend, close associate or
strong supporter of that politician, and he felt an obligation to
put my swarthy posterior in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Brother Man hooked me with his classic opening
salutation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil Johnson, you ignorant, half-breed n__ ...''
</P>
<P>
   And it went downhill from there. For three minutes, Brother Man
let fly with every stereotypical aspersion against
African-Americans and Mexican-Americans you ever heard. Of course,
he didn't use those hyphenated ethnic classifications. And he
embellished the nouns he did use with stark, poisonous epithets.
</P>
<P>
   In Brother Man's view, white people had created the greatest
society on earth, and ``since Lyndon Johnson gave you your
freedom,'' African-Americans and Mexican-Americans have messed it
up. He blamed the two ethnic groups for crime, the drug problem,
high taxes, the decline in morals and the ``dumbing down of our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly incensed about increasing interracial dating
and mixed marriages, declaring that ``black men want white women
because they know they are mentally inferior and they want their
children to be smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. He actually said that. Although I had heard all of
the other stuff before, that was a new one on me.
</P>
<P>
   I really didn't keep listening to Brother Man because of what he
said. It was the way he said it. He spoke with a fascinating kind
of windup toy inflection and rhythm. It was clear that he was
reading from a prepared text.
</P>
<P>
   I assumed at first that he was simply giving out the official
line of some hate group. But upon reflection I concluded that this
was his personal eruption of venom and that he took great pride in
his authorship.
</P>
<P>
   This was a big moment for Brother Man _ an opportunity to
release something that had been building up in him for years, a
chance to lash out at the source of his life's discontent and
frustration. He perhaps had not become the best that he could be or
grabbed his share of the American dream because, in his view, the
dream had become distorted.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of that distortion, according to Brother Man, were
the hyphenated Americans. It was as simple as that, and Brother Man
craved simplicity to put his unfulfilled aspirations into bearable
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment of understanding, my heart reached out to Brother
Man, and I felt his pain. I prayed then for him _ prayed that
Brother Man would search his heart and mind and appeal to his
Creator for a clearer vision of the purpose of human life and a
better appreciation of what he possesses and what he has done that
is of value.
</P>
<P>
   I prayed further for the relief of Brother Man's existential
anguish and for him to find some meaning in life to replace his
need to take solace in hatred.

`ONE TOUGH COP': A COP DISOBEYS ORDERS, AND PAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review.)

   When it comes to staying on the cutting edge of urban realism,
police movies have increasingly fallen behind television drama in
evoking the texture of urban life. And Bruno Barreto's film ``One
Tough Cop,'' although strongly acted and pungently written (by
Jeremy Iacone), is no exception. Despite a hearty two-fisted
performance by Stephen Baldwin as the tattooed lug of a main
character, the movie feels faintly old hat as well as mechanically
contrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Tough Cop'' is adapted from an autobiographical novel by
Bo Dietl, a highly decorated New York City police detective who
fancied himself a kind of Dirty Harry in the 1980s and was
eventually punished for bending the rules by being exiled from
Manhattan to a remote section of Brooklyn. He was only 35 when he
retired in discouragement from the force.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes off from a notorious 1981 crime in which two men
broke into an East Harlem convent school and raped and tortured a
young schoolteacher. The movie isn't so much about how the
fictionalized Bo helped solve that crime only to be denied official
credit as about its impact on his professional and personal
relationships. The East Harlem incident (in the movie the rape and
torture culminate in the nun's murder after 47 crosses have been
carved into her body) is so highly publicized that a special police
task force is assigned to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Disobeying orders, Bo and his loyal partner Duke Finnerty (Chris
Penn) continue to work on the case, based on a tip from Rickie La
Cassa (Mike McGlone), Bo's oldest and closest friend, a petty
mafioso whose restaurant is officially off-limits to Bo. Bo
nevertheless visits the place regularly, and it is there that he
and Duke brutally grill an informant Rickie has dug up through the
underworld grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Bo's relationship with Rickie, whom he loves as
a brother, is being scrutinized by a pair of icy federal agents who
issue Bo a blunt threat: either he installs a recording device in
Rickie's car or they destroy his career with surveillance
information they have gathered.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Duke, a compulsive gambler and alcoholic who
once saved Bo's life, is accruing thousands of dollars in gambling
debts to Rickie's underworld friends. To cap things off (most
improbably), Bo begins an affair with Rickie's ex-girlfriend Joey
(Gina Gershon), who left Rickie after giving up hope of his ever
leaving his wife and family.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Baretto chose this material. The Brazilian
director, whose last movie ``Four Days in September,'' examined the
moral ambiguities of radical terrorism in Brazil in the late 1960s,
is fascinated by the excruciating choices facing people in extreme
circumstances. In this movie, the director is unambiguously pro-Bo
and against the manipulative bureaucracies that he lashes out
against.
</P>
<P>
   But ``One Tough Cop'' has more story than it can comfortably
handle, and as it goes along it grows progressively less
believable. So much screen time is devoted to setting up the
conflicts that when things finally unravel, the denouement feels
rushed and anticlimactic. While officially tying up the loose ends,
it leaves you emotionally hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Tough Cop'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence, profanity and
sexual situations.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Sharon Stone, Kieran
Culkin and other actors in scenes from ``The Mighty.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Interviewing Sharon Stone these days comes with a built-in
warning _ not to mention a beefy bodyguard and a publicist poised
at her shoulder.
 &HT;    Three hours before Stone showed up for our interview at Beverly
Hills' Four Seasons Hotel her publicist marched into the room,
denied published stories that said Sharon was pregnant and warned,
``If you ask any questions about the pregnancy or her marriage the
interview will end right there. ''
 &HT;    When Sharon eventually showed up she looked gorgeous as always
but seemed something less than exuberant, admitting, ``I'm tired.
I'm fighting a cold. I always get this way when I do publicity
tours.''
 &HT;    Stone's mission was to talk up a storm about ``The Mighty,'' a
film in which she plays the unglamorous mother of a severely
handicapped young son, played by 15-year-old Kieran Culkin, younger
brother of McCauley Culkin.
 &HT;    It's a warm, sad tale about two boys handicapped in different
ways who use their imaginations and fondness for the legend of King
Arthur to forge a remarkable friendship.
 &HT;    The picture _ a hit at Cannes this spring, also stars Gena
Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton and ``X-Files''' Gillian Anderson in
an offbeat role as a loose, boozy broad.
 &HT;    But it's Stone who must sell the picture. She talks slowly and
without much fire, but looks pretty sensational in a gray cashmere
sweater and knee-high blue denim skirt, her blonde hair cut ultra
short _ ``I chopped it all off myself in a wild moment,'' she
explains.
 &HT;    ``Mighty'' director Peter Chelsom (``Hear My Song,'' 1991) says
when Stone read the script and agreed to play the plain-Jane role
he cautioned, ``Are you prepared to come as you are? You don't get
any special lighting or foggy filters for your shots.''
 &HT;    Stone, who also produced the picture, agreed; Chelsom says, ``It
was a commendable, noble ... and very intelligent thing for her to
do.''
 &HT;    The star herself makes light of the fact that Sharon Stone,
reigning Hollywood sex symbol should play a working-class mom. The
sexy image, she insists, is something male journalists have stuck
her with.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't exactly glamorous in `Last Dance,' was I?'' she
challenges, and indeed she did play a death row inmate in that 1996
picture. But it's difficult to forget that she zoomed her way to
the top of Hollywood's must-hire list after her role as the
psychopathic seductress opposite Michael Douglas in ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992).
 &HT;    Making ``The Mighty'' was different: ``I was impaled by the
emotion of this film,'' she says.
 &HT;    There have of course been big changes in her life in the last
year. For starters she got married, last Valentine's Day, to San
Francisco newspaper editor Phil Bronstein which caused her, she
says, to put less emphasis on her career.
 &HT;    It also brought her another home. In addition to the house she
owns in an upscale Los Angeles suburb, she now lives with her
husband in a high-rise apartment in San Francisco. And while Stone
wants to avoid motherhood and marriage topics, she did recount a
scary incident which took place a few weeks ago in the skyscraper
in the city by the bay.
 &HT;    The actress was trapped in an elevator for two hours between the
20th and 21st floors. She used her cell phone to call Bronstein,
who rushed to the building and talked her through the ordeal before
emergency rescue crews smashed their way to her from the adjacent
building and pulled her to safety.
 &HT;    ``The day after the rescue,'' Stone recalls, ``I fell apart when
I realized that the elevator could have crashed to earth and I
would have ended up an oil stain on the concrete. But strangely,
going through something like that brought Phil and I much closer
together. The rescue people were telling me to do one thing that
went against my gut instinct _ and Phil supported me by saying, 'Do
what you think is right.'''
 &HT;    Stone says she has become a regular housefrau and likes nothing
better than to bake up batches of cookies for her husband to take
to the guys on the paper. She's also developed a liking for writing
and has penned several short stories. ``I took a few lessons on how
to use a computer and finally was able to shop for three pairs of
jeans on the Internet. But it's not for me so Phil finally bought
me an old-fashioned typewriter.''
 &HT;    Besides ``The Mighty,'' she also stars opposite Woody Allen as
the voice of the princess in Dreamworks' new hit movie ``Antz.''
 &HT;    ``That was great,'' she says. ``I was able to do the voice-over
work in San Francisco without having to dress up in costume or
spend hours in a makeup chair.''
 &HT;    Her re-marriage and the fact that she hopes to become a mother,
says Stone, helped her weather turning 40 in March. (Her marriage
to producer Michael Greenberg ended after three years in l987.)
 &HT;    ``I often picked the wrong guy,'' she admits. ``I had problems
finding the right man simply because I never considered myself very
lovable. When boys came to my house when I was growing up it was to
see my younger sister Kelly. I was the ugly duckling in our family,
a real geek at high school. I had no sense of myself as a woman.''
 &HT;    But all that has changed since she met the macho Bronstein after
coming to San Francisco to star in this year's science fiction
movie ``Sphere.'' The film flopped but the romance blossomed.
Bronstein, say his friends, is a confident man with a strong sense
of his own identity who doesn't worry about becoming Mr. Sharon
Stone.
 &HT;    And he has certainly changed her perspective. ``I used to be in
love with my job _ and now I'm in love with my life and like my
job,'' says Stone. ``Stardom isn't the fuel of my soul any more.''

`HOLY MAN': RAISING CONSCIOUSNESS, LIGHTENING WALLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review.) 
(kd) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Widening the dewiest eyes this side of Bambi, Eddie Murphy turns
up bald and beatific in ``Holy Man.'' Is he or isn't he the purest
of beings, a sacred and unselfish soul? And what is his mission in
this movie? If he is mostly here to provide much-needed wisdom to
the crass television executive played by Jeff Goldblum, who has
crassness down to a science, then ``Holy Man'' needs some spiritual
enlightenment of its own.
</P>
<P>
   For all the funny possibilities of Murphy's neat transformation
here, the latest comedy from Stephen Herek (``Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure,'' ``The Mighty Ducks'') doesn't know what to
do with him. After letting him carry on wittily in divine mode for
a while, the film reduces him to a sunny sight gag and a catalyst
for its other characters. When Eddie Murphy is on hand with as
potentially inspired a bit as he's got here, losing track of him is
a cardinal sin.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, ``Holy Man'' is intended as a satirical view of
home-shopping sales pitches on television, the barn-size target
that achieves satire so nicely all by itself. So once the slick
yuppie Ricky Hayman (Goldblum) literally runs into Murphy with his
sports car (one of endless product plugs in a movie about forsaking
materialism), it's inevitable that the wise man and the wisenheimer
will intersect on the airwaves. When Murphy's character, simply
called G, starts imparting his thoughts to home shoppers, he
somehow raises their consciousness while also encouraging them to
buy. The screenplay by Tom Schulman, who wrote and directed ``Eight
Heads in a Duffel Bag,'' hasn't a prayer of making sense of this.
</P>
<P>
   The home shopping snippets feature familiar pitch people
(Willard Scott, Morgan Fairchild) and deliver dopey, winking gags.
The quest for laughs doesn't take this material to a terribly high
plane. Meanwhile, there's a cubic zirconium of a romance going on
between Ricky and Kate Newell, another executive, that G is on hand
to encourage. Kelly Preston plays Kate crisply enough to transcend
the film's garish costumes and harsh lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy arrives enjoyably at the start of the film, full of
surprises. And he's able to create relative bliss under even the
oddest circumstances. (For no discernible reason, a long scene at a
party has him hypnotizing the clothing designer Nino Cerruti.) As G
moves into Ricky's life, sleeping happily on the floor and
dispensing advice, the audience had best not wait for the other
shoe to drop. There isn't any. The film never really explains where
G came from or where he's going. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Man'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It
includes profanity, a brief sexual situation and smutty
double-entendres on the home shopping front.

STONE-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ At 40 and recently married, Sharon
Stone seems to be relaxing her tenacious pursuit of stardom and
trying to move away from her femme fatale image. Ironically, she's
finding the diversity of work she's doing more rewarding than ever.
By Bob Strauss. 
. 
IMMIGRANTS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Life in the big city can be cold,
lonely and debilitating to the human spirit, even more so for the
modern immigrants who arrive in New York with expectations that the
streets are paved with prosperity. David Riker, a
still-photographer-turned-cinematographer, offers a compelling
dramatization of their existence in his fictional ``La Ciudad,''
which has been chosen to close the Los Angeles Latino International
Film Festival on Sunday. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
DEVIL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Bad dialogue plagues ``Love Is the
Devil,'' a portrait of Francis Bacon, the British painter with the
infernally fertile imagination for depicting souls in agony who was
a pretty nasty piece of work himself. What is shocking, at least in
the way writer-director John Maybury presents it in his movie, is
that Bacon was such a lame sadist. 1 { Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
DETROIT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Detroit 9000'' (it's the code for
``officer needs assistance'') plays like an entertaining episode of
``Mannix'' with a funky Motown soundtrack. It's not a very good
movie, but it certainly has its share of camp value with its
mushrooming Afros, cheesy chase scenes and outdated lingo. 2 Stars.
By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
MIGHTY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``The Mighty'' tries to combine
handicapped-child pathos, murderously dysfunctional family
dynamics, knights-on-horseback fantasy and gritty urban realism _
not always successfully. The film does have some nice things going
for it, like a good bead on what friendship can mean to kids who
don't fit in and a surprisingly effective Sharon Stone in a limited
but tricky single-mom part. 2 1/2 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
HOLY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ A jumbled mess of conflicting messages,
``Holy Man,'' starring Jeff Goldblum, Eddie Murphy and Kelly
Preston, means to take both a comic and thoughtful look at
Americans' shop-till-you-drop mentality. But a shortage of material
combined with a syrupy presentation leaves the viewer with a bad
case of brain decay. 1 Star. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
COP-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Supposedly taken from the autobiography
of real ex-New York supercop Bo Dietl, ``One Tough Cop''
nonetheless plays like a formula TV episode. 2 Stars. By Bob
Strauss. 
. 
TOUCH-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Although it never overcomes a kind of
narrative ungainliness, ``Touch Me'' gets better as it goes along.
Bridgette (Amanda Peet) is an aspiring actress who makes ends meet
teaching some kind of yogaerobics at a Marina del Rey fitness club.
Before you can say sexual harassment, she's happily hit on by the
club's playboy manager Adam (Michael Vartan). 2 1/2 Stars. By Bob
Strauss. 
. 
LOH-THEATER (Johnson) _ ``Bad Sex With Bud Kemp'' is Sandra Tsing
Loh's Wonderland trip through the perils of dating in the '90s for
a single woman in her 30s. Sometimes the action on stage is a bit
too frantic, and cultural references fly off her tongue at a
dizzying rate, sometimes unnecessarily so. But those are minor
quibbles. By Rob Lowman. 
. 
DEAR-STAGE (Los Angeles) _  War has a funny way of turning
strangers into family, both on the battlefield and the home front.
Even Vietnam, the most rawly divisive conflict of this century, now
and then united Americans across sexual, age and ethnic boundaries
in a network of shared compassion, grief and courage. By Reed
Johnson. 
. 
COUNTRY-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Country stars Wynonna, Travis Tritt,
Tanya Tucker and Trace Adkins join forces at Sunday's ``Hollywood
Park Goes Country'' concert that will benefit the Shoemaker
Foundation, a nonprofit organization named for paralyzed jockey
Bill Shoemaker that helps those in the horse-racing industry who've
suffered catastrophic injury. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ You can't go anywhere in the record
business these days without hearing that '80s hair bands are surely
going to be the next big thing. Of course, these Prada-clad seers
were all wrong just two years ago when they predicted techno or
electronica was going to sweep the nation. That bleating,
one-dimensional Euro-noise got swept right out the back door
without selling many records at all. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ For her latest collection of tuneless
wanderings and cliche-ridden musings, Joni Mitchell, the once
mighty singer-songwriter mines the jazz-fusion hybrid that served
so well on landmark '70s albums like ``Hejira.'' Mitchell sings in
a voice that seems to come and go out of a rainstorm, offers
semi-coherent diary jottings that make Tori Amos look like
Hemingway. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
MURDER-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ This week on video we have two prime
examples of where today's Hollywood is finding its ``inspiration'':
``A Perfect Murder,'' which was based on the 1954 Hitchcock movie
``Dial M for Murder,'' which was based on the stage play of the
same name; and ``Lost in Space'' (New Line), which was based on the
campy 1960s television series, which was, of course, based on ``The
Swiss Family Robinson.'' By Rob Lowman.

`HOLY MAN' FAILS TO DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
 - REVIEW-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1 Star 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When I saw the trailer for the schmaltzy new stink
bomb ``Holy Man,'' I had a bad feeling. Here's why: When a
commercial has to show the same gag twice in a 30-second spot _ and
a stupid joke at that _ it's a certain sign that there's a paucity
of material.
</P>
<P>
   My fears were confirmed when I sat through this near two-hour
endurance test, a movie that makes a major case for the necessity
of truth in advertising. ``Holy Man'' is billed as an Eddie Murphy
movie, but we see more of Jeff Goldblum than Murphy. It's also
advertised as a comedy, but director Stephen Herek pours on the
syrupy sweet hokum so thick that you leave the theater with a bad
case of brain decay.
</P>
<P>
   A jumbled mess of conflicting messages, ``Holy Man'' means to
take both a comic and thoughtful look at Americans'
shop-till-you-drop mentality. Goldblum plays Ricky, a self-absorbed
executive at the Good Buy Shopping Network, a television channel
that hawks QVC-reject merchandise. Sales are down and the loudmouth
network owner (Robert Loggia) brings in a media analyst, Kate,
(Kelly Preston) to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky and Kate don't have much luck until they meet the beatific
G (Murphy), a pajama-clad pilgrim wandering the causeways of Miami.
G has a natural aptitude for sales and he's soon pitching ceramics
and chain saws on Good Buy, mixing in hokey spiritual platitudes
for good measure. Sales skyrocket, Kate and Ricky suddenly turn
into nice people, and buyers learn that a spoonful of Chopra-esque
sentiments helps ease the pain of ballooning credit bills.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hollywood at its hollowest. At one point, Kate tells
Ricky, ``I'm beginning to think of you as a real person.'' That's a
howler. ``Holy Man'' doesn't contain one true note or believable
character. Herek's ham-fisted direction of Tom Schulman's trite
script orchestrates every moment, and if you're not sure how you're
supposed to feel, Alan Silvestri's cloying score will nudge you
(with the gentle force of an electric cattle prod) right along.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a few funny moments amid the many missed
opportunities _ a couple of which actually aren't in the trailer.
Seeing the subdued Murphy wreaking havoc at the Good Buy Network is
good fun. But G's insipid spirituality is so cliched that only a
studio executive could consider it profound. Goldblum's gift for
obsequiousness makes him perfect for his role, but the material
sells him short.
</P>
<P>
   The film's final image did have some resonance for me _
unintentionally, of course. We see G walking off into the sunset
and then bending down to kiss the earth. After spending two hours
trapped to this toothless movie, I did the same thing on my way out
of the theater.

HOME VIDEO: A 1915 HORROR CLASSIC; NEW RELEASES

   Artistically, the film is a masterpiece. Commercially, however,
there's a bit of risk. ``People have to decide to commit seven
hours,'' said David Shepard, the preservation expert who restored
it. ``That's the roll of the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   This month Water Bearer Films, a New York distributor, is
offering Shepard's new edition of ``Les Vampires,'' Louis
Feuillade's 1915 surrealist silent classic about a band of
murderous brigands, called the Vampires, who assault the
bourgeoisie of Paris not only to gain money and power but also for
the pure kick of terrorizing the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, as was the case when ``Les Vampires'' originally
played in serial form, the production comes in 10 self-contained
episodes, making it possible to start and stop. Taken one by one,
each is a fascinating window on a director with a particular genius
for mixing the fantastic with the realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Feuillade's Paris and environs are cold and leafless, devoid of
the vibrancy the city is famous for, and hibernating in sterile,
crushingly oppressive propriety. In their very emptiness, the
streets throb with menace, perfect settings for the dark deeds that
Feuillade fully expected in life.
</P>
<P>
   Vampires kill without compunction, and employ every weapon from
sexual domination to heavy artillery in what amounts to an all-out
war against the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are lithe black-clad types in the hooded
terrorist mode, stand-outs in the bland, gray dream world of their
ripe, complacent victims. Just as often, though, they are
innocuous-looking tradespeople and other ordinary citizens fitting
craftily into mundane goings-on, the better to foment conspiracy
and wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Poisoner,'' for example, the Vampire called Venomous, a
chemical warfare expert, and his sexy henchwoman, the first Irma
Vep (the French actress Musidora), infiltrate the household of the
reporter and Vampire-fighter Philippe Guerande, who is about to put
on his own engagement party. Wrapped in white aprons and setting
the table with bored nonchalance, the Vampires cater the event,
lacing the champagne and killing a concierge. As he lies dying, the
man calls out a warning and Guerande packs his family off to a safe
haven (safe for how long?).
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly for an 83-year-old film, ``Les Vampires'' has
survived many perils itself. In 1938, much of it was thrown out and
was actually awaiting trash collection on the street when it was
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the film is in the public domain. Shepard, who did
the restoration work on the acclaimed ``The Art of Buster Keaton,''
released last year, undertook this project with the blessing of
Gaumont, the French company that owned the trademark and some of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's digital restoration cleaned up many imperfections and
corrected the film's pacing. Tints have been reapplied (many were
lost during various incarnations), titles have been redone and a
symphony orchestra takes over from a lone piano player (who at some
showings was known to hammer away for the entire seven hours) to
provide accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   On four cassettes, ``Les Vampires'' is $99.95. Information:

   The X-Files
</P>
<P>
   Despite a flood of Internet hype about how it would enhance the
television X-plot, Rob Bowman's film goes wandering in other
directions. Having devastated Early Man 37,000 years ago, aliens
are back in business; they've even subverted the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. That brings out agents Mulder (David Duchovny)
and Scully (Gillian Anderson), but by broadening itself for a
general audience, the movie only dilutes the cult intensity. As
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, that leaves it to the
Mulder-Scully relationship (ever unfulfilled but promising) to
carry ``a middling, unfocused action-adventure with brand-name
appeal.''

   The Last Days of Disco
</P>
<P>
   In his usual high style, Whit Stillman captures a particular
breed of privileged young woman in that brief time of
free-spiritedness between college and career. ``We look really good
tonight,'' Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) tells Alice (Chloe Sevigny)
as they approach a disco entrance. ``I'm sure we're going to get
in.'' These aren't wild characters, just tame ones looking for some
fun while they begin their strivings in New York. Once again,
Stillman ``renders his characters' fretfulness in deft, funny and
improbably touching ways'' (Maslin).

   The Big One
</P>
<P>
   If Michael Moore had his way, the national anthem for ``The Big
One,'' as he calls the United States, would be ``We Will Rock
You.'' As he's done since his documentary ``Roger and Me'' (1989),
Moore continues to ambush corporate executives with aggressive
questions about their business practices. Is it decent to close
American plants so they can pay Mexican laborers 85 cents an hour?
Why does TWA use prison inmates to make flight reservations? Why
doesn't Steve Forbes ever blink? Moore brings in an eye specialist
to consider that question. ``Do not threaten to call the police or
have him thrown out,'' a company warned its employees in a memo
about him. He's done it all before, but once again he spins ``an
entertaining film out of these same tactics.'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1997. Miramax. $104.16. 96 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide Kings
</P>
<P>
   Four prep school boys (Sean Patrick Flannery, Henry Thomas,
Jeremy Sisto and Jay Mohr) and a friend (Johnny Galecki) kidnap a
Mafia boss (Christopher Walken) in the hope that in return for his
own freedom, he will quickly raise the $2 million needed to release
the recently kidnapped sister of one of the boys. But only Walken
stays cool in a film that desperately wants to be hip. Though
there's nothing wrong with the performances, other principal
characters seem out of step with an ``uneven comic suspense film''
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1997. Artisan. $83.33. 106 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time or appeared on television.
</P>
<P>
   PENALTY. After a young boy's legs are amputated by an
incompetent doctor, he grows up to become the sadistic Blizzard, a
criminal mastermind portrayed by Lon Chaney, who spends the entire
film with a crazed look on his face. Some silent film fans
attribute the intensity of Blizzard's nasty demeanor to the fact
that Chaney's legs were painfully doubled up for the role and
encased in leather stumps. 1920. Kino. $19.98. 93 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD and CYRANO. Two productions from
Globalstage, a San Francisco distributor, present theater
productions designed for children age 7 and up. Thomas Hardy's
``Far From the Madding Crowd'' (1998, 132 minutes) about the
attractive Bathsheba Everdene, who runs her farming estate in
19th-century Wessex with fierce independence and who is courted by
many before falling in love with the wrong man, was performed in
England by the Snap Theater. Filmed in Antwerp, ``Cyrano'' (1998,
100 minutes) was performed by the Blauw Vier theater company. Both
productions were made by BBC Resources, a part of the British
Broadcasting Corp. $27 each. Information: (888) 324-5623.

STONE TRADES POWER FOR LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 - MOVIE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a while, the big stuff just isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is so different for me now,'' Sharon Stone explains.
``It used to be about sex and money and power and love and life and
death. A character like Catherine Tramell (`Basic Instinct's'
icepick princess, the role that made Stone a superstar in 1992) was
a power character for me at that time. But if I played her now, she
would have to be a love character, because it's all that now for
me.'' Now 40 and married earlier this year to San Francisco
Examiner executive editor Phil Bronstein, Stone uses the L-word a
lot in conversation these days.
</P>
<P>
   Loves old pals Woody Allen (``Stardust Memories,'' Stone's first
film) and Sylvester Stallone (``The Specialist''), with whom she
shared vocal duty on the hit computer animated comedy ``Antz.''
Loves writer-director-actor Albert Brooks, whose obsessive comedy
``The Muse'' she's just wrapped. Loves Kieran Culkin and Elden
Henson, the young stars of her latest release ``The Mighty,'' which
opens today.
</P>
<P>
   It shows on the screen, too. At least in ``Antz'' and
``Mighty,'' there's very little of the bad girl act that Stone has
astutely exploited in both her popcorn (``Sliver,'' ``The
Specialist,'' ``The Quick and the Dead'') and her serious
(``Casino,'' which earned her a Golden Globe award and Oscar
nomination, ``Last Dance'') work.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means, however, that Stone's gone completely
marshmallow. She's just, as always, defying expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many rules are made for so many stupid reasons,'' says
Stone, who indulges such anti-movie star activities as turning down
lucrative sequels (``If they make `Basic Instinct 2,' it won't be
with me'') and cutting her own hair. ``And to follow a rule instead
of following the joy of life is so disturbing. But it's a very
complicated thing, because rules are made so that people don't get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of several knotty themes addressed in ``The Mighty,''
which Stone co-executive produced and has a supporting role in as
the strong, supportive single mother of a handicapped child with an
empowering imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Rodman Philbrick's novel for young adults ``Freak the
Mighty,'' the film charts the nurturing relationship of two junior
high outcasts _ Kevin Dillon (Culkin), who suffers from the
growth-inhibiting, degenerative Morquio's syndrome, and Maxwell
Kane (Henson), a socially inhibited giant of a boy from a
criminally dysfunctional home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the script and I was impaled by the emotion of it,''
Stone says. ``I'm glad that I got to do it because it evoked so
much in me emotionally that I really needed a place to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding this admission from one of Hollywood's toughest
cookies was the requirement that ``Mighty's'' Gwen Dillon always
wear the most reassuring face for her doomed son and his
uncomprehending friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part was much more about controlling the emotions I felt
than finding the emotions of it,'' she says. ``She has to allow him
quality of life, as much as she possibly can, without risking the
length of his life. She has a big juggling act to do. She has to be
his friend, be his mom, be his dad, be there for him without
suffocating him. It's a fine line.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to play a subtler character. OK, it's true not
everyone can do opera. I can hit the high notes; in fact, that's
probably my specialty, playing erratic, intense characters. But
it's like, every time I do something, everyone says, `Why'd you do
that?' or `That's not like anything you ever did before.' I really
want to do something different every time because I want to be the
best artist I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Mighty'' director Peter Chelsom, the operatically
inclined star arrived at the movie's freezing, Toronto location
without diva baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a film like this, where everyone is doing it for
the one reason only that they believe it's a story they want to
tell, there's a kind of dispersing of the hierarchy,'' says the
British Chelsom (``Hear My Song''). ``It's easier; life is not
about trailers and how long it takes to get them out of the
trailers.''
</P>
<P>
   That looks like the pattern for the foreseeable future. Besides
having already shot Brooks' independently produced ``Muse'' and a
Sidney Lumet-directed remake of John Cassavetes' odd mix of violent
gunplay and adult-child bonding ``Gloria,'' Stone is set to do two
scenes for ``Simpatico,'' a film based on a Sam Shepard play. Then
she'll star in a San Francisco-set romantic comedy by a first-time
director; Stone returned part of her salary in exchange for filming
the movie in her new hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be on the road all the time and expect my marriage to
be growing, too,'' says Stone, who permits herself an occasional
weekend in the L.A. sun when the Bay Area fog gets too oppressive.
``If they hadn't agreed to make it there, I wouldn't have done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the security of a solid relationship has had a
profound impact on every aspect of Stone's life (she was briefly
married before, when she was in her 20s).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very much like a lone warrior for a long time, and
so I didn't have anything to risk,'' she reckons, adding, with an
ironic smile, ``Of course, now I have less to risk because he can
take care of me. Boy, there's a lot of comfort in that. Who knew?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stone is happily hurling herself toward demure
domesticity. Recent false rumors that she was pregnant annoyed her
so much that, after issuing a categorical denial, she refused to
discuss the subject. And maturity seems to be ruling her decisions
as much as romance is these days. She is, after all, remarkably
seasoned, having achieved the worldwide celebrity and Hollywood
respect she so longed for ... while constantly being reminded that
those are rarely sure, solid things, and that disappointment is
part of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I'm wiser or just tired,'' she says.
``You know how aging goes. You become much more selective day to
day: what you go through, what you deal with, what you look at,
what you listen to, what you answer, who you hang out with. I don't
know whether it's because you have enough experience to know what's
a waste of time and what isn't, or it's because you're just tired
and don't want to deal with it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Stone has not been able to repeat the
commercial/pop-cultural success of ``Basic Instinct.'' Even when
she has tried to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' she muses. ``I'm really surprised that
`Sphere' wasn't a big blockbuster. It was so beautiful and
interesting, had all these special effects, and we did such cool
things, tons of action and great actors. Why wouldn't you expect
that that would be the hugest blockbuster ever?''
</P>
<P>
   The undersea fantasy plopped more like a great big water bomb
when it opened in February, despite the pedigree of a Michael
Crichton story, direction by Oscar winner Barry Levinson and a cast
that included Stone, Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But Stone has had worse career frustrations. For a dozen years
before ``Basic Instinct,'' the former Pennsylvania beauty queen and
Ford model appeared in stuff like ``Deadly Blessing,'' ``Bolero''
and ``Police Academy 4.'' She got so fed up with show business that
she almost quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was my fault because I was accepting the crap,''
she admits. ``I thought that, if I didn't, I wouldn't have any jobs
_ and it's often like that. But I had to get to a point where I was
willing not to have jobs. I had been a waitress and I really,
really, really enjoyed waitressing. So I decided I'd just waitress,
and do theater in my garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't keep doing what I was doing. I just couldn't. I had
to be willing to have nothing to have something.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, things turned around before extreme steps were
necessary. (Stone still indulges her avocation, though.
``Sometimes, on holidays, I'll waitress at a Salvation Army or
something,'' she says. ``It's so fun because these people don't go
to the movies, don't have TVs. They don't know me from Adam; they
just think I'm a darn good waitress.'')
</P>
<P>
   These days, professional setbacks don't inspire thoughts of
career abandonment. If anything, they've encouraged Stone to
reassess her relationship with her acting. To approach it, if you
will, less like a job and more like love.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel something,'' she says of recent choices she's
made. ``I've played parts that I could intellectualize, and then I
could sense a comprehension and understanding. But more, as I
understand myself as an artist, I'm drawn to projects that simply
make me feel something. And I think that this is valid and
worthwhile.''

CHRISTIAN ROCKERS GO TO BIG-LABEL HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The big difference between life on an indie label and
life on a major label: It all boils down to cash, baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything costs more money,'' says Yuri Ruley, drummer for
MxPx. ``We look at everything and wonder, `Why does it cost so much
money to do this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: Money talks. And MxPx, which moved from the
indie world of Tooth &AMP; Nail Records to living large on A&AMP;M Records,
has seen the difference. With the push of the label behind them,
the punky popsters have toured Europe and watched their album,
``Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo,'' earn a Japanese release.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more connections now,'' Ruley says, calling from
the band's home base in Bremerton, Wash. ``We have label people in
every country. We have international booking agents. It's a lot
nicer now.''
</P>
<P>
   When some indie acts move up the food chain, there is fallout.
Rock-and-roll iconoclasts immediately think sellout when some bands
go to the majors. Making the transition even stranger, Tooth &AMP; Nail
is known as a Christian label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their premise is that they want to put out music made by
Christians that was good,'' Ruley says. ``A lot of the labels at
that time in the Christian market were, `No, no, no.' They only
wanted stuff that would sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole Christian tag seems to be something MxPx is touchy
about. The band's official A&AMP;M bio doesn't mention it, although the
group played the church circuit, like most Christian rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, the group's songs tread similar waters to groups like
Audio Adrenaline, even if the message isn't as blatant. Then again,
MxPx's ``Tomorrow's Another Day'' (``But just know this, that God
is faithful / Even if you don't have faith in yourself'') is pretty
hard to mistake for Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a stereotype about Christian music,'' Ruley
says. ``We weren't ashamed of calling ourselves Christians, but we
didn't want people that hadn't heard our music to judge us, to
think that we were something we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the threesome _ including bassist/singer Mike Herrera
and guitarist Tom Wisniewski _ never felt entirely comfortable in
the Christian-music community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get stuck in that world,'' Ruley says. ``It's comfortable
there _ you can sell millions and it will be the same people buying
your records. You're not actually growing any. A lot of our fans
thought we were disavowing our faith when we did that (left Tooth &AMP;
Nail), but we were just trying to keep our options open.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the frenetic threesome have managed to successfully work
in the secular world. They were on the Warped Tour and have shared
the stage with Reel Big Fish, No Doubt and Dance Hall Crashers. All
this, and none of the guys has celebrated a 22nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really been hard,'' Ruley admits, discussing the
band's evolution from alt-Christian heroes to alt-rock faves. ``I
don't think people want to mope about stuff. Our songs are sort of
positive, and the spiritual element is fairly subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'm sure some people (begin ital) do (end ital) want
to mope, but it's been fine for us.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Life in the big city can be cold, lonely and
debilitating to the human spirit, even more so for the modern
immigrants who arrive in New York with expectations that the
streets are paved with prosperity. David Riker, a still
photographer-turned-cinematographer, offers a compelling
dramatization of their existence in his fictional ``La Ciudad,''
which has been chosen to close the Los Angeles Latino International
Film Festival on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Riker's black-and-white film is broken into four vignettes _
``The Puppeteer,'' ``Bricks,'' ``Home'' and ``Seamstress'' _ that
tell differing aspects of the isolation and hand-to-mouth reality
that awaits the wave of newcomers. His storytelling and camerawork
convey the powerlessness of his characters, who are not actors but
immigrants from the Americas, the Dominican Republic and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   While despair is never far away, Riker never lets his characters
wallow in self-pity. Instead, they demonstrate a life-affirming
resilience and a sense of community in spite of aching misfortune
and unscrupulous bosses who exploit them for cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Ciudad'' will screen at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Paramount
Studios Theatre, 5555 Melrose Ave., Hollywood. A gala party follows
at the Conga Room, and a ticket for both event costs $25.

   `LOLITA' STORY: For anyone curious why this summer's remake of
``Lolita'' dropped out of sight immediately after it opened, the
answer is simple. It ran for one week in late July at the Landmark
Fine Arts Theatre in Beverly Hills to qualify for Oscar
consideration, before being pulled from theaters _ as planned _ so
Showtime could screen it in early August. It goes into wider
release today in nine major cities after reopening here in theaters
late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which co-stars Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith and
fresh-faced Dominique Swain in the title role, is director Stephen
Schiff's retelling of Vladimir Nabokov's novel about a man's
obsession with a sexually precocious teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita'' is playing at the Laemmle Town Center Cinema in
Encino, the Laemmle Esquire in Pasadena, the Cineplex Broadway
Cinemas in Santa Monica and the Westside Pavilion in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC OF GERSHWIN: ``Rhapsody in Blue'' and ``Shall We Dance,''
a pair of films filled with the brilliant melodies of the late
American composer George Gershwin, will screen at 7 p.m. Oct. 16 as
part of the Academy Standards series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhapsody'' is the lavish film biography of Gerswhin, who died
in 1937 at the age of 37, that features an Oscar-nominated score.
Robert Alda portrays Gershwin and Herbert Rudley his lyricist
brother, Ira. ``Shall We Dance'' is the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers
musical-comedy for which Gershwin wrote the musical score. The song
``They Can't Take That Away From Me'' was nominated for an Oscar,
but even more memorable is ``Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.''
</P>
<P>
   The screening in the Samuel Goldwyn Theatre commemorates
Gershwin's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $5 for general admission, $3 for academy members,
and may be purchased in advance during business hours at the
academy or by mail. The academy is at 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly
Hills. Call (310) 247-3600 for information.
</P>
<P>
   THE INTERACTIVE USC: Mark Pesce, who has earned a reputation as
a cyberspace and virtual reality innovator, has been named director
of the interactive media program at the USC School of
Cinema-Television.
</P>
<P>
   Among his accomplishments, Pesce is credited with inventing the
Virtual Reality Modeling Language, or VRML, the standard computer
language used to create three-dimensional worlds on Internet Web
browsers. Most recently, Pesce was chairman and chief technology
officer of Web-based entertainment company blitcom LLC, and has
been a consultant to Apple Computer Corp. and Sega of America. He
has written three books about the World Wide Web and articles
dealing with virtual reality and the information superhighway, and
he serves as an adviser to several companies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   As director, Pesce plans to expand the school's noted writing,
directing and production courses into areas of game design,
interactive narrative and techniques. ``We expect that graduates of
this program will generate the best of the next generation of
interactive works,'' he added.

MOMS AND BOMBS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; War has a funny way of turning strangers into
family, both on the battlefield and the home front. Even Vietnam,
the most rawly divisive conflict of this century, now and then
united Americans across sexual, age and ethnic boundaries in a
network of shared compassion, grief and courage.
</P>
<P>
   One such unlikely alliance is the subject of ``Dear Mrs.
Baker,'' playwright Nancy Anne Baker's stirring, true homage to her
remarkable mother, Marilyn Baker. During the '60s and '70s, Mrs.
Baker, a patriotic suburban housewife and librarian from Fremont,
Calif., became pen pals with more than 50 American GIs serving in
'Nam, after responding to a soldier's letter in a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After the young soldier began sharing the cookies, books and
puzzles he received, Mrs. Baker found herself exchanging letters
with dozens of servicemen, whose missives she kept in neat
scrapbooks.
</P>
<P>
   As combat took its toll, many of the soldiers went beyond
expressing their gratitude and opened their souls to reveal their
growing pain, horror and disillusionment. Mrs. Baker offered
unconditional support and a long-distance shoulder to cry on, even
while acknowledging she never could fully comprehend the reality
unfolding across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1968, the pivotal year of the Tet Offensive, ``Dear Mrs.
Baker'' hasn't entirely succeeded in shaping this extraordinary
tale into convincing dramatic form. Understandably, perhaps, the
playwright's portrait of her mother lacks a sufficiently sharp
critical edge that would offer some greater evidence of the
``eccentricity'' that Mrs. Baker's neighbors see in her behavior,
which is otherwise as perkily, emphatically normal as her pink hair
ribbon and crisp June Cleaver dress.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Darcy Shean, however, finds a more complex character
than the one written on the page. A woman of great empathy and
humility who could pass for Pat Nixon's younger sister, Shean's
Mrs. Baker possesses a schoolgirl sparkle. An expression of flirty
pleasure comes over her face when she reads the soldiers' letters,
momentarily mingling with her steady maternal warmth. When Mrs.
Baker ponders aloud whether to send chocolate-chip cookies or
snickerdoodles to the Mekong Delta, Shean's understated
self-assurance keeps the line from sounding inadvertently clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Shean gets unusually strong support from the six actors playing
the GIs: Christopher Delisle, Joe Camareno, Charles Mitri, Seth
Walther, Martin George and, best of all, Brian Pope, who brings a
surprising jocularity to his role as a sanguine medical staffer. By
contrast, the three servicemen's mothers detract from the
fascinating central relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Devereux's resourceful staging merges lyrically with
Alex Hajdu's terrific environmental set design, in which Mrs.
Baker's tidy garden melts into the darker foliage of the jungle.
GIs pop up out of trap doors and swing down from overhead thickets
as Devereux's clever tableaux juxtapose Mrs. Baker sewing or
cutting flowers, while her surrogate sons toss grenades and dodge
incoming mortar rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mrs. Baker'' sustains these separate realities, which
never quite touch but bleed together in powerful rivulets. By
evening's end, ``Dear Mrs. Baker'' will have written itself into
your memory.

SINGERS HAVE CHARITY IN MIND FOR HOLLYWOOD PARK CONCERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Tanya Tucker loves it. Travis Tritt says he
doesn't have a lot of time for it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite varying degrees of interest in the racing green, both
country stars will join Wynonna and Trace Adkins in a concert
Sunday at Hollywood Park to benefit the Shoemaker Foundation, a
nonprofit organization named for paralyzed jockey Bill Shoemaker
that helps those in the horse-racing industry who've suffered
catastrophic injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled to be able to play for Shoemaker,'' Tucker
said this week. ``He's super and has always been my favorite
jockey. I've seen him race so many times at Del Mar and Hollywood
Park, and every time I didn't bet on him, I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Tritt says he enjoys a day in the stands whenever he has time.
But with a new baby and a busy touring schedule, he doesn't get out
to the track as much as he'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Both stars of ``Hollywood Park Goes Country'' are looking
forward to performing on the turf. While there won't be racing
Sunday evening at the park, satellite wagering from Santa Anita
will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a fun situation to play outside,'' said Tritt,
whose latest single, ``If I Lost You,'' was rising this week in the
country charts. ``It creates an excitement level, and an energy
starts going back and forth between crowd and performer. It's a fun
exchange when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shoemaker Foundation was launched in 1991, the year
Shoemaker was paralyzed in an automobile accident in San Dimas. One
of the winningest jockeys in the history of the green, Shoemaker
once dominated the standings at Santa Anita, where he won every
riding championship from 1951 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has helped nearly 175 individuals and their
families across the country, said executive director Rod Pitts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only foundation on the West Coast that helps people
in the racing industry from all segments, from jockeys to grooms,''
he said. ``With insurance the way it is today, many of these
medical problems just aren't covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who landed her first hit with ``Delta Dawn'' in 1972
when she was just 13, said a prediction she made about the future
of country radio a few years ago had actually come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the new, younger artists on the radio anymore,''
she said. ``I mean, there's no reason why Merle Haggard can't have
another hit record. I'd like to see some of the older acts get more
involved than they have been. And there are some great new acts out
there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tritt isn't so optimistic. Considered one of the leading new
country singers of the early '90s, Tritt believes each act should
be judged on the merits of their most recent album. At the same
time, he says, commercial country radio is still resistant to
so-called heritage artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an artist who was considered one of the new guys, I see
it from both sides,'' Tritt said. ``The problem is, older artists
don't get a chance simply because of their age or the perception
that they're through. That isn't true in pop music where, for
example, if Rod Stewart came out with a really great album or song,
he'd get airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if George Jones or Waylon Jennings or Merle came out with
a really great song, they're not going to get played on country
radio because of the perception attached to older artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, whose 30th album, ``Complicated,'' was recently issued,
admitted that while it's difficult to guess the future, country
music's traditions will always carry on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain artists will pick up the mantle forever,'' she said.
``Another way to tell is the number of people coming to Nashville.
It used to be Hollywood, but now everyone's heading to Nashville to
be a star.''

BACON'S SADISTIC NATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 2 { Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It comes as no shock that Francis Bacon, the
British painter with the infernally fertile imagination for
depicting souls in agony, was a pretty nasty piece of work himself.
</P>
<P>
   What is shocking, at least in the way writer-director John
Maybury presents it in his movie ``Love Is the Devil,'' is that
Bacon was such a lame sadist. Focusing on a segment of the Swinging
'60s, when Bacon's emotional cruelty drove his lover and model
George Dyer to suicidal depression, the film more convincingly
gives the impression that poor, dumb George was undone by listening
to Bacon's sniveling excuses for witticisms all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champagne for my real friends; real pain for my sham
friends,'' Bacon (Derek Jacobi) snips as he enters a pubful of
abuse-loving perverts, and that's about as bon as his mots ever
get. I don't know what Bacon's personality was really like, but it
seems logical that a man with so harrowing a talent for visual
expression could sometimes speak in lines that didn't sound lifted
from a third-rate drag queen revue.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fascinating transference going on here between Bacon
and Dyer (played with a lot of trembling and perspiration by Daniel
Craig); as long, at least, as they keep their mouths shut about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon met the Cockney crook while the latter was burglarizing
his studio. The artist, of course, wasted no time blackmailing the
hunky thief into bed. He even encouraged Dyer to take the upper
hand in their bondage games.
</P>
<P>
   But in all other aspects of their relationship, Bacon dominated
the intellectually limited Dyer. In public and private, the poor
dope was constantly criticized and embarrassed _ and by Bacon's
circle of roadshow Noel Cowards, no less. No wonder he turned to
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On the formal front, Derek Jarman protege Maybury is
incorrigibly artsy, but interestingly so. Employing distorting
lenses, shadowy compositions punctuated by splatters of vivid color
and all manner of weird angles and foreground clutter, he comes
close to approximating the elongated, twisted hellscapes of Bacon's
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings which, perversely, Maybury never shows us. I don't
know if there was a problem with the Bacon estate or what, but it
plays like another misjudged aesthetic strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is the Devil'' is hardly without merit. It shows us, in
excruciating but bold detail, how a toxic relationship can fuel
unique and vital creativity.
</P>
<P>
   It just shouldn't have left us asking whether so much bad,
ironic dialogue was worth all the torment. &UR;

`DETROIT 9000': DETECTIVE BUDDIES AND RACIAL BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review.) 
(kd) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after it was first released, ``Detroit 9000''
_ with its tale of a womanizing Washington politician, campaign
finance shenanigans, urban crime, suspicion and hostility between
blacks and whites, and the moral question mark that hangs over its
conclusion _ has attained the status of a valuable cultural gauge.
Even the reason it is being reviewed now says something about life
and attitudes toward race and film in these United States.
``Detroit 9000'' revolves around a theft of $400,000 in jewelry and
cash at a formal-dress fund-raiser among black supporters of a
black congressman eyeing the Michigan governorship. When made in
1973, the movie was classified as a blaxploitation film intended
primarily for black audiences and was consigned mainly to the black
theater circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrected by Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Company,
``Detroit 9000'' is an intriguing artifact. With its soul music,
1970s fashions and evocation of the bleak atmosphere hanging over
Detroit, where it was filmed with the considerable cooperation of
the police, the film remains freighted with some of the
hopelessness that pervaded so many crime-ridden and devastated
inner cities at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the genre the French call a policier, the film
is unexceptional. A familiar odd-couple pairing of detectives, one
white, one black, is assigned to solve a high-profile robbery of
prominent blacks at the downtown hotel ballroom fund-raiser for
Rep. Aubrey Hale Clayton (Rudy Challenger) on the night he has
declared his intention to run for the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing exceptional characterizes the sleuthing in ``Detroit
9000'' _ the 9000 is code for an officer's distress call _ and at
times the plotting does not bear intense scrutiny. But as written
by Orville Hampton and produced and directed by Arthur Marks, the
film rides on the edgy relationships between blacks and whites in
general, and in particular between the two police officers at its
center.
</P>
<P>
   The white officer, Lt. Danny Bassett, is played by Alex Rocco,
perhaps best known to filmgoers as Moe Green, who meets a memorable
end, shot through eyeglass lens and eye in ``The Godfather.''
Bassett is a classic street cop, known for his ability and honesty,
and resentful of being denied the promotion that went to the
officer who assigns him the case and pressures him to solve it in a
hurry. That officer went to school to advance his career while
Bassett remained on the street, and he reminds Bassett that times
are changing.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett is no diplomat. Reporters are pressing to know whether
the crime was a case of blacks ripping off blacks or whites
determined to keep a black man from high office. Bassett really
doesn't care to pander to anyone's preconceptions about the race of
the criminals. All he wants to do is catch them.
</P>
<P>
   In the background of Bassett's life is a mentally disturbed
wife, spewing racial and ethnic bigotry from a wheelchair in a
public mental institution, which absorbs a good deal of Bassett's
income.
</P>
<P>
   The black detective, Sgt. Jesse Williams (Hari Rhodes), could be
a role model for role models. He is handsome, college educated,
athletic, a good guy (he helps run basketball games at a boys'
club) and so sexy that his girlfriend, who teaches at Wayne State
University, can scarcely keep her hands off him.
</P>
<P>
   That he and Bassett never resolve their relationship, like the
latter-day team of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in the ``Lethal
Weapon'' series, is telling.
</P>
<P>
   In general release, ``Detroit 9000'' illustrates the wisdom of
the adage ``better late than never.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit 9000'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes uninhibited language, bloody
violence, partial nudity and simulated sex.

`TOUCH ME' NOT SUNK BY ITS TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 2 { Stars  
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although it never overcomes a kind of narrative
ungainliness, ``Touch Me'' does get better as it goes along.
</P>
<P>
   One wishes the same for its heroine. Bridgette (Amanda Peet) is
an aspiring actress who makes ends meet teaching some kind of
yogaerobics at a Marina del Rey fitness club. Before you can say
sexual harassment, she's happily hit on by the club's playboy
manager Adam (Michael Vartan), whose father owns the place.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly recognizing that they share a similarly high PSI rate of
air in their heads, the attractive kids are well on the road to
brainless bliss when a bump in the form of Bridgette's high school
boyfriend informs her that he's dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, she tests positive for HIV. Bad news for Bridgette
and Adam _ but encouraging for viewers. Both the acting and the
script, by director H. Gordon Boos and producer Greg H. Sims, get
better as the story grows darker, personal stakes rise and serious
thoughts have to, finally, be thought and dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch Me'' maintains an air of low-budget amateurism to the
end. Boos exhibits no sense of pacing, overloads the thing with
stereotyped characters (an oversensitive AIDS support worker played
by Greg Louganis, a self-destructive little brother for Adam, an
earthy life force in the form of a dying-young African-American
mother, etc.) and, when one scene would do the trick, takes three
to make the same obvious point.
</P>
<P>
   But Boos also has a knack for quietly, patiently building depth
and complexity into apparently shallow lives. ``Touch Me'' may, for
the most part, be a TV disease movie with a little extra sex. But
it also shows us two people dealing, in very specific, human ways,
with a devastating problem that's as hard to comprehend as their
nourishing need for one another.

`DETROIT 9000` FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First it was chop-socky. Now it's blaxploitation.
What's next for pop-culture advocate Quentin Tarantino? Beach
Blanket Bingo?
</P>
<P>
   Forget I said that.
</P>
<P>
   When Tarantino gave the thumbs-up to Grade B, '70s urban action
in ``Jackie Brown,'' you knew it was only a matter of time before
his production company, Rolling Thunder, started rolling out
``classics'' from that era. The first, and perhaps the last, to hit
theaters is ``Detroit 9000,'' a little-known cop movie about racial
tensions in Motor City. Or, as the city is known in the film, the
Murder Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit 9000'' might have been somewhat groundbreaking when it
was released in 1973. Lead roles for African-American actors were
few and far between (come to think of it, they still are) and it
certainly wasn't common for a cop drama to feature a black
detective and a white detective working side by side to catch the
bad guys. If a film did feature such a partnership, the man of
color inevitably would be killed. (See ``Magnum Force.'')
</P>
<P>
   That said, today ``Detroit 9000'' (it's the code for ``officer
needs assistance'') plays like an entertaining episode of
``Mannix'' with a funky Motown soundtrack. It's not a very good
movie, but it certainly has its share of camp value with its
mushrooming Afros, cheesy chase scenes and outdated lingo. I've
seen much worse movies in theaters this year; but then again, I've
also seen better cop shows on late-night television.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a heist film with masked hoods hitting a black
congressman's fund-raiser and making off with $400,000 in cash and
valuables. Was it an inside job? Or, to quote one character's
learned opinion, was it a ``honky caper to keep blacks from
power''?
</P>
<P>
   A cantankerous white detective with no respect for authority
(Alex Rocco, who memorably played Moe Green in ``The Godfather'')
is paired with a rising black super-cop (Hari Rhodes) to find the
crooks. Their styles clash, of course, but they wind up getting
along, acting as sort of a model for racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Director Arthur Marks (``Bucktown,'' ``Friday Foster'' and, yes,
a ``Mannix'' veteran) filmed ``Detroit 9000'' on a shoestring, but
managed to capture the city in all of its grimy splendor. The
action is pretty outdated _ when someone is hit by a bullet (a
comical rarity given the number that are fired), the blood explodes
like in a torrid game of paintball. And the color is fire-engine
red to boot.
</P>
<P>
   What's ironic is that this is a movie that, 25 years ago,
couldn't find its way out of urban areas, and the situation hasn't
changed. ``Detroit 9000'' is opening exclusively in the Magic
Johnson Theatres in Baldwin Hills. I guess even Tarantino's stamp
of approval has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to you to decide whether that's good or bad.

DECORATING A HOME OFFICE FOR LOUIS XIV 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The home office may seem like a new idea, but it has
existed for at least 300 years in the West. In fact, ``From Paris
to St. Petersburg: Important French and Russian Furniture and Works
of Art,'' an exhibition that opened this week at the Chinese
Porcelain Company, shows three ``home offices'' from three
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which continues through Oct. 31 at the gallery at 475
Park Avenue, at 58th Street, in Manhattan, includes tall cabinets
and secretaries with panels that open to become desktops _ perfect
for an IBM Thinkpad, printer and phone.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a two-piece ensemble, a cabinet and matching table,
all rigged up and ready to go, for $600,000. For another $160,000,
you can get an incense burner, known as an athenienne, with gilt
bronze satyr heads and cloven feet that is far more attractive than
a fragrance candle.
</P>
<P>
   Move over Ikea: here comes Louis XIV.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of the three home offices is a monumental ebony
cabinet on a stand, made by the Manufacture Royale des Meubles de
la Couronne, commonly known as the Manufacture des Gobelins, in
about 1680. This royal workshop in Paris made furnishings for royal
palaces, employing weavers, painters, bronze workers, cabinetmakers
and goldsmiths.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1660s, Louis XIV's finance minister, Colbert, gave the
factory new royal patronage to inspire the French nobility to take
the king's cue. It was part of his campaign to stimulate the
manufacture of luxury goods in France _ to stop the French from
buying expensive imports.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously inspired by the Italian Baroque, the opulent cabinet
has an elaborate, carved giltwood stand whose legs are in the form
of cherubic caryatids, seen from the waist up. Each cherub holds a
wooden tasseled pillow above his head, on which the cabinet top
sits. The cherubs are linked by carved garlands.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet's intricate marquetry doors depict bouquets of
flowers in urns, with wild foliage, birds and butterflies in
purplewood, walnut, holly, satinwood, boxwood, cherry and ivory
inlays. The scenes are framed by inlaid fillets of pewter. The
cabinet's doors open to reveal a silk-lined interior with a central
shelf and two drawers.
</P>
<P>
   The matching table, obviously made by the same Gobelins master,
is an equally virtuoso display of craftsmanship, with identical
motifs. Unlike many tables with caryatid legs, the cherubs on this
table all face front, which means the table was meant to be set
against a wall, as a desk would be.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the gallery director, Khalil Rizk, explained, people
often remove the two back legs and turn them around, so the table
can be placed in the center of a room. This table, however, retains
its original form. This is the set that costs $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The second cabinet is dated 1755 and is smaller. More important,
it is signed ``RVLC,'' the initials of a famous French ebeniste,
Roger van de Cruse, popularly known as Lacroix. It is called a
secretaire a abbatant, a freestanding writing desk that looks like
a cupboard, complete with drawers and compartments that can be
locked.
</P>
<P>
   Its fall-front panel closes vertically, to conceal books and
papers. This ingenious design is still being copied today.
</P>
<P>
   This secretary is also decorated with marquetry, but in a
totally different style. Here the scenes are chinoiserie. James
Cummings, the author of the sumptuous catalog that accompanies the
show, suggests that they were influenced by the 18th-century French
painter Antoine Watteau.
</P>
<P>
   The top panel depicts a Western woman in Chinese costume
carrying a parasol. She is watching a group of Chinese launderers
who are working at large tubs under a tree. The inlay is made with
minute pieces of satinwood, rosewood and other exotic woods stained
red, pale green and orange. The facial expressions are charming and
delicate.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is a tour de force. The drawers and the interiors
of the doors are covered in an elaborate geometric design, like
wallpaper but worked out in marquetry.
</P>
<P>
   Also from this era is the incense burner, thought to be made in
Paris about 1780 for the Russian market. It is made of steel and
copper, with gilt bronze decorations, including a pine cone top, a
sunflower frieze, ram's and satyr heads.
</P>
<P>
   Such incense burners, Risk said, were meant not only to freshen
the air but also to banish bad spirits. The superstitious Russians
hoped the incense would protect them from evil.
</P>
<P>
   The third secretary, from 1810, is more severe, neo-classical in
style, with flaming mahogany veneers and elaborate gilt bronze
mounts that resemble a garland of flowers. Its pale pearwood
interior boasts not only drawers but also a mirrored back. Here,
you can do both papers and your makeup, a practical home office
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the mirrored interior that attracted one former
owner, Daisy Fellowes. Ms. Fellowes, granddaughter of the sewing
machine magnate Isaac Merritt Singer, was an American beauty who
lived in Paris, after her first husband, the Duc de Brissac, died
in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   She was considered one of the world's best-dressed women. When
she was the editor of Harper's Bazaar, she bought the Tete de
Belier, a pink diamond with 17.47 carats that Catherine the Great
once owned. The diamond inspired the Paris couturier Elsa
Schiaparelli to create a new color: shocking pink.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing visitors to the Chinese Porcelain Company see is
a window dressed with a set of gilded Russian armchairs upholstered
in shocking orange.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Russians would have used such a color, which seems
more in the 1950s taste of the late Parisian decorator Henri
Samuel, will surely be a subject of discussion at a symposium next
week sponsored by the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the
Decorative Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The Center is sponsoring the conference next Friday and Saturday
to present new research on upholstery produced between the 17th and
19th centuries. The two-day conference will be held at The Abigail
Adams Smith Museum's auditorium at 417 East 61st Street and costs
$175. Information: (212) 501-3000.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium will include talks by various specialists flying
in from Britain, France, Germany, Austria and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upholstery has been the poor relation in the furniture
world,'' one scheduled speaker, Frances Collard of the Victoria &AMP;
Albert Museum in London, said. ``Only recently have people become
interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Elizabeth Lahikainen, a private conservationist
in Essex, Mass., said: ``Historic upholstery has distinguishing
factors: material distinctions, fabric styles and upholstery
techniques. When you are upholstering old pieces, you have to think
about the content of the original fabric, color and scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Have they done that at the Chinese Porcelain Company? What would
Ms. Lahikainen think about that shocking orange? Go back to your
office, but stay tuned.

HOW `BAD SEX' CAN BE VERY GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early in her one-woman show, ``Bad Sex With Bud
Kemp,'' Sandra Tsing Loh explains one of the differences between
men and women.
</P>
<P>
   One of her male friends, she says, tells her that on his death
bed his one regret will be over all the women that he didn't sleep
with.
</P>
<P>
   Loh, on the other hand, says on her death bed her one regret
will be over all the men she did sleep with.
</P>
<P>
   You can see this coming, but it's funny anyway. And it's pure
Loh, as anyone who has heard her five-minute gems on National
Public Radio knows. But you have to wonder if these wry and biting
observations would work in her 75-minute one-woman show.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, because Loh expands beyond being a mere
monologuist and makes the stage a sort of outer reality for her
inner angst and still keeps it funny. ``Bad Sex'' is Loh's
Wonderland trip through the perils of dating in the '90s for a
single woman in her 30s. It's where she searches for, if not love,
at least a nonhumiliating relationship. The fictional Bud is the
name of a longtime friend who Loh ends up sleeping with.
</P>
<P>
   Painted a hospital green _ very serene or surreal as the case
may be _ the pegboard set by Kevin Adams is ingenious, with props
conveniently sliding, dropping down or folding out as needed. Under
David Schweizer's direction, the lanky Loh freely prowls the stage,
the restlessness and unease she feels about the new dating game
reflected in her kinetic energy. As she acts out her situations _
like the presex ritual of Bud and Loh rubbing legs together
underneath a table after a company softball game _ Loh sometimes
looks like she's performing a bizarre modern-dance movement.
</P>
<P>
   Loh presents herself as the kind of woman ``men fall back on,''
depend on for advice, borrow money from. But wanting more, she
decides to encourage Bud to move beyond the weekly movie stage of
their relationship (with their separate containers of popcorn).
Their first attempt at intimacy ends disastrously. ```This is weird
after all these years,' he says. `I know,' I say, `but I think
you'll like it'.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the title implies, things do not go well, and Loh stands
there _ in one of her clever turns of phrase _ with ``accusing
breasts.'' Sex between two people can be such a lonely thing, she
sighs.
</P>
<P>
   This letdown sends her on a frantic quest for a man. First to a
video dating service through which she meets Robert Blair, an
architect and a Ralph Fiennes look-alike who is too, too precious.
Then on to an island lesbian fantasy with Jacqueline Bisset before
turning to online sexual chat rooms where she becomes jealous of
her made-up cyber persona, who gets invited to places the real Loh
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   She follows this with an affair with a younger man, her ``Raging
Bull'' _ Tony ``ride me'' Pony, buff but dumb, and soon becomes
bored. Finally, she pulls out a piano and goes into ``Songs in the
Key of Me,'' her Joni Mitchell-independent woman stage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she ends up dealing again with Bud and Robert Blair in
an unexpected way _ and in the meantime arrives at a bit of
enlightenment as she emerges from her adventures battle-scarred but
happier.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the action on stage is a bit too frantic as Loh jumps
from role to role. And cultural references fly off her tongue at a
dizzying rate, sometimes unnecessarily so. But those are minor
quibbles.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that ``Bud Kemp'' is a well-written piece of
theater. And though this is a familiar mating/war story, Loh's
force of presentation and smart battle observations make ``Bud
Kemp'' a pleasure.

`ONE TOUGH' FILM TO EMBRACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 2 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``One Tough Cop'' plays like a particularly
uninspired episode of ``NYPD Blue'' that goes on too long. If your
idea of gritty police fun is spending an evening in a room full of
Andy Sipowiczes, you might get something out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not interested in self-destructive stupidity or
counting how many expletives can be squeezed into an
hour-and-a-half, you'll likely get bored pretty quick.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly taken from the autobiography of real ex-New York
supercop Bo Dietl, the film nonetheless plays like a formula TV
episode. Dietl (Stephen Baldwin) is brave, hotheaded and, of
course, on the edge. His partner, Duke (Chris Penn), is a reliable
backup, but troubled and doomed. Dietl's childhood best friend,
Rickie La Cassa (Mike McGlone), is, of course, a mob underboss.
Just as predictably, Dietl has an affair with his dangerous pal's
mistress Joey (Gina Gershon) at precisely the wrong moment _ like
there's ever a good time to betray your underworld-connected buddy.
</P>
<P>
   What happens is, a nun is raped and tortured; Rickie helps Dietl
and Duke crack the case, just as some feds are pressuring Dietl to
set up Rickie. Some glory hounds from downtown are out to screw
up/take credit for the real cops' hard, smart work. Oh, and Duke's
gambling debts are rising and he's drinking too much.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the third act comes around, everyone's so mad
they've forgotten how to talk, and just shout cuss words at one
another.
</P>
<P>
   It's like screenwriter Jeremy Iacone somehow got ahold of Steven
Bochco's plot point computer program and printed all the data out
in script form. To his credit, director Bruno Barreto, though a
long way from his Brazilian heyday of ``Dona Flor and Her Two
Husbands,'' gets good urban atmosphere up on the screen and
generally credible performances out of the always-angry ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   But every actor has, basically, the same three notes to play:
get outraged, spout off about tortured concepts of loyalty and make
self-defeating moves. No wonder their voices grow ever louder as
the movie plods along.

TRY TO AVOID `TAMING THE TIGER' 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
JONI MITCHELL/``Taming the Tiger'' (Reprise)
<TEXT>
<P>
   For her latest collection of tuneless wanderings and
cliche-ridden musings, the once mighty singer-songwriter mines the
jazz-fusion hybrid that served so well on landmark '70s albums like
``Hejira.'' Mitchell's atonal guitar chords wash over everything
here while saxophonist Wayne Shorter noodles away in some
pseudo-mystical fashion all the way through several mediocre
tracks. Mitchell herself, singing in a voice that seems to come and
go out of a rainstorm, offers semi-coherent diary jottings that
make Tori Amos look like Hemingway. Avoid ``Taming the Tiger'' and
buy another copy of ``Blue'' instead. 1 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DUNCAN SHEIK/``Humming'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   Can't honestly say I've heard this album, even though I've
played it something like eight times. Every time I give it a shot,
I fall into a deep sleep. Three times on the living room couch,
I've awoken with a start at midnight; twice in the car, I've had to
pull over and look for a shade tree; once, sitting in a
particularly uncomfortable hard chair, I began exhibiting the
symptoms of an electrocution, drool and all. Sheik, whose
atmospheric ``Barely Breathing'' from his 1996 self-titled debut
became a radio staple, is the Captain &AMP; Tennille of the '90s. Dull,
dull, dull. 1 Star. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HARVEY/``Is This Desire?'' (Island)
</P>
<P>
   Proving the de-evolution theory, Polly Jean Harvey's music
gradually becomes more accessible with each release. This album,
her fifth, follows the acclaimed 1995 effort, ``To Bring You My
Love,'' which garnered Grammy nominations and artist-of-the-year
accolades. ``Desire'' offers stark but generally upbeat character
studies of women like ``Angeline,'' the opening track, ``prettiest
mess you ever seen.'' Unlike past discs, Harvey's voice isn't
electronically altered often, and her Delta-inspired phrasing, by
way of the English countryside, lends an earthy feel. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``VH1 Divas Live'' (Epic)
</P>
<P>
   VH1 brings together Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain,
Gloria Estefan, Aretha Franklin and Carole King for predictable
solo and group performances. If you're an unshakable fan of any
three of these MOR divas, or feel you simply must own yet another
rendering of Dion's shoot-me-before-I-hear-it-again ``My Heart Will
Go On,'' you might get your money's worth. However, anyone else
should pass on these generally overblown star turns. The exception
is any track featuring the great Aretha, a national treasure if
ever there was one. 1 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOHN MELLENCAMP/``John Mellencamp'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Working-class hero Mellencamp hasn't forsaken his trademark
heartland rock 'n' folk sound on his first self-produced release
for a new label. The initial single, ``Your Life Is Now,'' suggests
all that is still worthy about the fellow, including signature
fiddle, sturdy rhythm guitar and heartfelt vocals. Longtime
Mellencampers will delight in ``Eden Is Burning,'' which revisits
Jack and Diane from '82's ``American Fool.'' Elsewhere, Mellencamp
seasons his meat 'n' potatoes approach with hints of funk, r&AMP;b and
a touch of reggae. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NIRK FRANKLI/``The Nu Nation Project'' (GospoCentric)
</P>
<P>
   Gospel goes hip-hop. It's not a new story, but few do it better
than spirit-chasing superstar Franklin, who captures both the
intensity and abandon of the best parts of both genres on this
contemporary gospel effort. Best moments include funky opener
``Revolution'' and the star-studded ``Lean on Me,'' featuring
cameos from Mary J. Blige, Bono and R. Kelly. Praise Jesus and pass
the keys to the Jeep! 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHISKEYTOWN/``Faithless Street'' (Outpost)
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued on an indie two years ago, this was the
collection that got Raleigh, N.C., alt-country rockers Whiskeytown
noticed. Now a 21-song reissue boasting new artwork and nine bonus
tracks, this terrific disc proves singer-songwriter Ryan Adams is a
writer of many dimensions. The song list is almost entirely
wonderful, touching on a wide array of moods and styles.
``Faithless Street'' is even better than the album that received
the big push. 3 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
UNKLE/``Psyence Fiction'' (London/MoWax)
</P>
<P>
   This concept album generally falls flat. UNKLE is an aggregation
headed by sample king DJ Shadow and MoWax label chief James
Lavelle, featuring cameos from such heavy hitters as Radiohead's
Thom Yorke, the Verve's Richard Ashcroft, the Beastie Boys' Mike D.
and, unexpectedly, Metallica's Jason Newsted. Unfortunately,
despite strong advance notice, the coldly disjointed and often
overly ambient ``Psyence Fiction'' rarely satisfies. Although
Shadow and Lavelle try, UNKLE is no Massive Attack. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TONY BENNETT/``The Playground'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Tony Bennett made inroads with younger
audiences with a hugely successful ``MTV Unplugged'' concert and
album. Now he's going for the ``Sesame Street'' kids with ``The
Playground,'' an album of lovingly crafted favorites that include
duets with Kermit the Frog (``Bein' Green,'' ``Firefly''), Elmo and
Rosie O'Donnell (``Put on a Happy Face''). The appeal of this
wonderful recording won't be limited to children, though. Bennett
is in fine voice throughout, and ably backed as usual by the Ralph
Sharon Quartet, he alternates between moods both playful (``The
Bare Necessities,'' ``Dat Dere'') and wistful (``When You Wish Upon
a Star,'' ``The Inch Worm''). It's a tough trick to appeal to all
ages and stages, but Bennett has pulled it off. Beautifully. 3 {
Stars.

SQUEAKY AXL GETS THE GREASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You can't go anywhere in the record business
these days without hearing that '80s hair bands are surely going to
be the next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these Prada-clad seers were all wrong just two years
ago when they predicted techno or electronica was going to sweep
the nation. That bleating, one-dimensional Euro-noise got swept
right out the back door without selling many records at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunset Strip metal? It does seem to have some commercial
potential, if only because there are so few guitar-oriented rock
bands treading the boards at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the albums chart shows r&AMP;b, country, swing,
pop and Marilyn Manson collecting the bulk of record buyers' votes.
</P>
<P>
   So, we now have Cinderella, Motley Crue, Poison, WASP and RATT,
among others, busy getting their hair teased and gearing up for the
old reunion trek around the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Generally considered the best of this bizarre genre was Guns N'
Roses, whose 1988 debut album, ``Appetite for Destruction,'' has
lingered in the pop catalog chart for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Guns N' Roses, don't you? Their once-ubiquitous
hits included ``Welcome to the Jungle,'' ``Paradise City'' and
``Sweet Child o' Mine.'' The videos were played on MTV practically
every 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there aren't many original Guns left in Guns N' Roses. By
all accounts, it's down to just singer W. Axl Rose and bandanna
bossing a bunch of anonymous session musicians around a dimly lit
recording studio someplace.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the guys _ Izzy, Slash, Duff, Dizzy and Matt _ all
flew the coop during the past six years, either trying new projects
or dropping out of music altogether.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow that does remember is Silver Lake fop Andy Prieboy,
composer-performer of ``White Trash Wins Lotto,'' a cabaret piece
loosely based on Rose's life.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the style of a Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan musical, ``White
Trash'' is a bitingly funny look at the rock myth and all the
decadence that goes along with it. Prieboy, who used to front Wall
of Voodoo, next performs the witty spoof Oct. 22 at Largo in West
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   I've known Prieboy for almost 20 years. In the early '80s, we
worked together at a horrible right-wing San Francisco law firm,
survival jobs since we both played in bands. Prieboy was a
messenger. Whenever it was his turn to make a run, another
messenger would be dispatched to a forgotten storeroom to wake
Prieboy up.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, his band Eye Protection was considered ``weird'' by
the little Hitlers who ran the Bay Area's punk-rock good taste
squad. Prieboy was banging a piano and performing rock cabaret at a
time when anything beyond three chords was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem likely the Strip will ever again fill up with
crowds willing to pay to see the latest straight-faced hard-rock
outrage. But, if anything, Prieboy may just have a hit on his hands
with his takeoff of a near-forgotten rock footnote.

GANGSTA RAP PIONEER REACHES OUT TO WIDER AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If ``gangsta'' rap is dead, then somebody forgot to
tell Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if what I'm doing is still considered gangsta
rap, but I feel it is,'' Cube tells about 20 writers in a
teleconference call from Los Angeles, home of the hard-core rap
movement.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of supergroup N.W.A. (with Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella
and the late Eazy-E), Ice Cube helped pioneer the bass-heavy beats
and obscenity-drenched lyrics that define gangsta rap.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it seems as if Ice Cube has outlived the gangsta
movement, which saw its popularity peak in the early '90s. And,
despite rumors, the rap veteran has no plans to announce his
retirement. Besides, Michael Jordan proved he's still got game,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody screams that I'm about to retire,'' Cube says. ``I'm
not. Not at all. I still think I can rap as good as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cube has spent more time recently on the silver
screen than behind the mike. He made his acting debut in 1991's
``Boyz N the Hood.'' More recently, he co-starred in 1997's
``Anaconda,'' then directed and starred in this year's ``The
Player's C lub.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Cube is concentrating on music and is ready to release ``War
&AMP; Peace,'' two CDs originally scheduled to be packaged together.
The first CD, ``War,'' is due Nov. 17; The follow-up, ``Peace,''
will be released next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set everything aside _ movies, producing _ to focus on me,''
says Cube, who describes the tone of the albums as ``dark.'' ``For
a couple of years, I lost focus just by trying to do so many other
things. This record is focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Cube also believes ``War &AMP; Peace'' could be his best recording
to date, a lofty statement coming from a guy whose past solo
records achieved critical acclaim and are viewed by many as the
voice of urban youth.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, is the spokesman for Black ghettos touring with
Korn, a group that attracts testosterone-driven suburban White
kids?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to expose myself to the audience that Korn would
bring,'' says Cube, who invited the group to the studio to record a
track on ``War.'' ``I think a lot of people that would go see a
Korn show might not see a Cube show with a billing of all rappers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the game so long, I have my fan base. If I don't
try to expand, then what am I doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding his musical horizons may mean upsetting some of his
longtime followers, even though it isn't Cube's intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to lose my Black audience,'' Cube says. ``I
want to put something together that's so good that everybody likes
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cube promises his live format hasn't changed. Fans will still
hear all the rap hits, such as ``Wicked'' and even N.W.A.'s
``Straight Outta Compton.'' But being the pioneer that he is, Cube
is always trying to branch out, regardless of critics who argue
he's straying from his hard-core gangsta roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to worry about the hard-core, but I'm the (begin ital)
definition (end ital) of hard-core,'' Cube says. ``I put it all
together . . . me and four other dudes named N.W.A.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ When they say there's nothing new under the sun,
you know the film community takes that to the nth degree by
remaking everything that was old under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   This week on video we have two prime examples of where today's
Hollywood is finding its ``inspiration'': ``A Perfect Murder''
(Warner Bros.), which was based on the 1954 Hitchcock movie ``Dial
M for Murder,'' which was based on the stage play of the same name;
and ``Lost in Space'' (New Line), which was based on the campy
1960s television series, which was, of course, based on ``The Swiss
Family Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Hitchcock for inspiration is fairly common. A director
like Brian De Palma has practically made a career out of it,
turning out Hitchcockian films such as ``Obsession'' (1976) and
``Dressed to Kill'' (1980). But with ``A Perfect Murder'' and the
upcoming ``Psycho,'' filmmakers are going directly to the source,
and it also calls for comparisons to the master.
</P>
<P>
   As for old TV shows, there have been so many of them made into
feature films _ from ``The Addams Family'' to ``The Brady Bunch'' _
that the real question becomes ``What hasn't been made into a
movie?'' Considering some of the turkeys that have been foisted on
us recently _ ``McHale's Navy,'' ``Sgt. Bilko'' _ we can only hope
we're at the bottom of the well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's nothing wrong with dipping into the past to create
something new. After all, Shakespeare borrowed some old plots for
some of his most important plays. But Shakespeare produced
masterpieces, and we are not talking about masterpieces here.
Actually, we'd settle for mildly diverting.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the 1960s TV series it was based on was truly
inane, it's almost surprising that ``Lost in Space'' is a fairly
enjoyable _ although predictable _ film. Maybe starting with a
silly premise is the way to go. The recent failure of ``The
Avengers'' is a perfect example of what not to do. In that case,
the filmmakers took a smart and sophisticated show and sucked out
all the charm while subbing in a bunch of odd special effects that
were suppose to distract you.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers behind ``Space'' were smart enough to keep the
general premise of the TV show and then throw out the rest. Instead
of a cardboard Robinson clan, this family is dysfunctional. John
(William Hurt), the father, works too hard, sending taped apologies
to his kids when he misses key events in their lives. The kids
(Heather Graham as the brainy Judy, ``Party of Five's'' Lacey
Chabert as rebellious teen Penny and Jack Johnson as 10-year-old
Will) are, of course, alienated, and mother Maureen (Mimi Rogers)
struggles to hold them all together. Dr. Zachary Smith (Gary
Oldman) is evil instead of insipid, and pilot Don West (Matt
LeBlanc) is a cocky loner rather than being a clean-cut bore. All
of this makes for better dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, the robot is jazzed up, although it has the same
voice (Dick Tufeld). The action is fast-paced, and there are a
number of dazzling visual effects. All this adds up to a fun
package for any 13-year-old and younger while not boring older
viewers. The lesson here is not to rely on your original material.
Remember back then there were only three networks, and a lot of
stuff that was popular then won't cut it in today's world of
sophisticated content, multichannel TV, computer-generated
special-effects films.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``A Perfect Murder,'' it faced different problems. First,
``Dial M for Murder'' was minor Hitchcock. The director was forced
to film the cat-and-mouse stage play (in 3-D no less) because of
contractual obligations. Second, the play itself is a contrived
Agatha Christie-style knockoff.
</P>
<P>
   In the original, Ray Milland is a playboy married to heiress
Grace Kelly, who is infatuated with mystery writer Robert Cummings.
Fearing he'll lose her and her riches, he plots to have her
murdered. In the update, financier Michael Douglas, whose fortunes
are shaky, is worried that he will lose his rich young wife
(Gwyneth Paltrow) to a virile young painter (Viggo Mortensen) and
so plots to have her killed.
</P>
<P>
   So what have the filmmakers brought to this new adaptation?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Paltrow does have a great wardrobe, and wears it well. Her
Manhattan apartment is exquisitely decorated. The plot twists are
retwisted, but not necessarily for the better. Douglas keeps up a
malevolent presence. And did I mention Paltrow has a great
wardrobe?
</P>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder'' is not a bad movie; it's just sort of ``so
what?'' Its most controversial aspect was the pairing of
25-year-old Paltrow with the 54-year-old Douglas, which was also
``so what?'' since they didn't have any overly amorous scenes and
she was falling for a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't answer the question of why anyone bothered to
remake ``Dial M for Murder,'' unless they were fashion
connoisseurs.

A SPARE `LEAR' INFLECTED BY BECKETT AND BRECHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lear and his daughters make their entrance, they walk into
a room whose walls are the color of dried blood. In Richard Eyre's
stunning, minimalist production, the only furniture in that room is
a long table and chairs, swathed in fabric of the same blood red.
Fiery torches provide light, and the men wear medieval-looking
tunics. Yet the women's long, high-collared dresses seem modern,
even futuristic, and their hairstyles are conspicuously
contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily it's a bad sign when someone begins by praising a
play's scenery and costumes, but this Masterpiece Theater ``King
Lear'' defies all expectations. Its visual look draws in the
audience so effectively that the pared-down set becomes part of the
ensemble. The hints at different chronological periods do not
collide but blend together to give this ``Lear'' a timeless air,
emphasizing that it is the most elemental of Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Sleekly trimmed to focus on the eternal themes of family love,
betrayal and grief, the play has also been dazzlingly adapted for
the camera by Eyre, based on his stage production at the Royal
National Theater in London last year. At times the only backdrop is
fog, as when the blinded, exiled Earl of Gloucester meets the
madman he cannot recognize as his good son, Edgar.
</P>
<P>
   In one dreamlike, atypically elaborate scene late in the play,
Cordelia, her army planning to rescue the father who has rejected
her, is seen under a starry sky with rows of candles blazing before
her, dressed in armor as if she were Joan of Arc. Meanwhile, the
off-camera voice of a messenger describes her to the loyal Earl of
Kent (``You have seen sunshine and rain at once _ her smiles and
tears were like'').
</P>
<P>
   This is Shakespeare filtered through Beckett and Brecht, but it
is far from a slick attempt to update the play. The result is a
production of such freshness that it seems we are seeing the old
story anew.
</P>
<P>
   A major preconception about this ``Lear'' should be tossed out
at the start, though. Many critics praised Ian Holm's stage
performance as one of the best Lears in memory, but it does not
seem quite so towering here. Holm is never less than strong and
intelligent (nothing to take for granted). Yet when he rails and
rages at the elements, his solid, conventional Lear lacks the
freshness to match that of the production. It does more justice to
Holm to consider him as the crucial center, offering a precise,
modulated performance that holds the play together even while Lear
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Holm's interpretation highlights Lear's madness, and his flashes
in and out of lucidity are the most poignant scenes. There is a
hint of lunacy from the start, as he cackles while dividing his
kingdom among his three daughters, foolishly demanding expressions
of their love.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fierce Lear, and Victoria Hamilton's Cordelia has a
fierceness to match, establishing a powerful link between them. In
one questionable cut from the text, Eyre has eliminated Cordelia's
asides explaining that she cannot express the depth of her emotions
(``Love, and be silent''). But Ms. Hamilton creates a memorable
Cordelia, both strong-willed and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   When Lear moves to the homes of his snakelike daughters, Barbara
Flynn as Goneril and Amanda Redman as Regan bring a suitably crisp,
no-nonsense edge to their callous treatment of their father. Their
houses duplicate the same stark set as in the opening scene, though
the walls, like their clothes, are now black and gray, as if
mirroring their bloodless hearts.
</P>
<P>
   With gray hair and beard, Lear's Fool (Michael Bryant) is
visually his double here, expressing all the truths Lear is still
unable to grasp. ``Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
been wise,'' the aged Fool says, and Lear responds with the line
that is the soul of this interpretation: ``O, let me not be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The parallel plot is just as sharply defined, with Timothy West
as a strong, touching Gloucester. As his duplicitous bastard son,
Edmund, Finbar Lynch is a weasely contemporary plotter, heard in
voice-over as he describes his plan to turn Gloucester against his
legitimate son, Edgar (Paul Rhys). Eyre's sparing yet effective use
of voice-over smoothly adapts Shakespeare's explanatory passages
for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes in which Lear howls against the elements on the heath
have not been transformed with quite the same success. There is
driving rain and wind, a stark black backdrop and brown earth. Yet
the effect is too much like a stage production trying to represent
a landscape, instead of the bold minimalism that so perfectly
embodies the mood in this version's other scenes. When a defiant
Lear yells ``I am a man more sinned against than sinning,'' and
rapidly tumbles into madness, it is easy to imagine that these
episodes worked better in the theater. Holm got much attention for
tearing off every stitch of clothing on stage; here there is a
distant hint of nudity, suggesting that these scenes might not have
been reworked for the screen enough.
</P>
<P>
   Like Holm's performance, this ``Lear'' is most eloquent in
quieter moments. The camera closes in and captures the intimacy of
Lear's excruciatingly sad, late recognition of how much he has
misjudged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, do you know me?'' a weeping Cordelia asks the ragged old
man the king has become.
</P>
<P>
   When Lear answers: ``I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you,'' he displays his heartbreaking state,
a loss so total he cannot count on love or even lucid thoughts.
Whatever its small lapses, this is a magnificent ``Lear.''

TAKING TOGAS TO BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dialogue is ongoing, but it looks likely that Sophocles is
heading for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way between a group of commercial
producers and the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., to bring the
theater's acclaimed production of ``Electra'' to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which stars Zoe Wanamaker as Electra, closed on Sunday
after receiving glowing reviews for its slimmed-down take on
Sophocles' tragedy, which was produced in association with Duncan
C. Weldon and the Donmar Warehouse in London.
</P>
<P>
   Now, producers Eric Krebs, Randall Wreghitt and Anita Waxman say
they are close to making a deal to bring the show to the Barrymore
Theater in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Princeton and saw one of the most exciting artistic
achievements in a long time,'' Krebs said. ``That excitement takes
all the other barriers out of the way.'' He added, ``I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bauer, a spokesman for the theater, confirmed the talks with
the producers and said a deal might be completed within a week. But
he cautioned that many details are still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is there's a strong buzz,'' he said. ``And
definite interest in moving `Electra' to New York.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the autumn schedule is still falling into position, the
spring season's casts, crews and theaters have bloomed in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of a revival of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' which begins rehearsals on Tuesday with a new book and
interracial cast, have announced that they have booked the Longacre
Theater, beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   At the Roundabout Theater, Stockard Channing has signed on to
play Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry II's sparring partner in ``The
Lion in Winter,'' opening in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me to play the role,'' Ms. Channing said.
``But I'm glad someone else thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And after the lion, a lamb. Robert Sean Leonard, the boyish star
of last summer's ``You Never Can Tell,'' will return to Broadway in
March in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' appearing with Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Farthest afield, Jerry Zaks has been named as director of Frank
Wildhorn's latest musical, ``The Civil War.'' The show, on a tryout
run in Houston, is scheduled to open at the St. James Theater in
April. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fall season suffered its first fatality on Sunday when
``Stupid Kids'' closed suddenly at the Century Center for the
Performing Arts. The post-mortem suggests the cause of death was
simple: low ticket sales and a prickly relationship between the
theater management and the producers, led by the Shubert
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The $400,000 production, which opened at the Century on Aug. 25,
after a summer run at the WPA Theater, was losing about $25,000 a
week, said Gerald Schoenfeld, the Shubert chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said his organization and the show's four other
producers were willing to put more money into the show, but pulled
the plug after negotiations to extend the use of the theater
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   At the WPA, the play received mixed reviews. The producers moved
the show to the larger space, expecting to draw young audiences, an
elusive but potentially lucrative crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It never did. Ticket sales for many performances were less than
half the theater's 299-seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The producers enjoyed a discounted rate on the theater rental,
which they wanted to continue after the contract expired in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to renegotiate,'' said Ralph Odom, the managing
director of the theater. ``We did not feel prepared to do that.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two plays dealing with the turmoil and hopes for peace in
Northern Ireland are drawing high-profile supporters from both
sides of the political divide.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army, plans to attend the opening of
``Binlids,'' at the Angel Orensanz Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written and performed by 14 women from West Belfast,
chronicles the lives of Catholics under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, David Ervine, the spokesman for the Progressive
Unionist Party, which represents Protestant paramilitary groups at
peace talks with the IRA, was a special guest at the opening of ``A
Night in November,'' a play by Marie Jones at the Douglas Fairbanks
Theater. That show is about a Protestant hooligan.

   `` `Binlids' grew from the desire of the people to tell their
side of the story, a side that hasn't been told,'' Adams said.
``You can only deal with issues when they're really recognized and
acknowledged.''

   Ervine, meanwhile, said that while the Protestant community
``gets fairly heavily slammed'' in ``Night in November,'' the play
is ``about being antisectarian, and that's good.''

   Both plays were developed at Feile an Phobail, a West Belfast
festival and are co-produced by the Belfast-based Dubbeljoint
Productions.
</P>

   ``They're both saying what has happened since partition is
causing a horror story,'' said Pam Brighton, the artistic director
of Dubbeljoint. ``And there's a kind of optimism in both that
things are getting better.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Unhealthy ozone pollution is showing up more often,
and Southern states are particularly hard hit, a public lobbying
group reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings are cause for alarm,'' said Rebecca Stanfield of
U.S. Public Interest Group, which analyzed air quality data from 41
states and the District of Columbia. ``People will continue to
become sick and die prematurely from air pollution until the
standards are met, and this means polluters need to start cutting
their emissions immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Between April 5 and Sept. 14 of this year, the group found,
there were at least 5,208 violations of the new, stricter ozone
pollution standard issued last year by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   That means that three out of four days in this period, someone
in the United States was breathing unhealthy air, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the new ``smog'' standard was violated 19 times
more often this year than the old, looser standard was last year.
If the new standard had been in effect in 1997, the number of
violations would have risen 27 percent this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution appeared not only more often, but also in some
unexpected places, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   California, long plagued with dirty air, violated the standards
on at least 79 days. But surprisingly, North Carolina was second
with 68 days, said Jayne(cq) Mardock of the Clean Air Network, an
environmental group that contributed to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have considered it up there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mardock said North Carolina's air quality problems have a lot to
do with its rapid rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a lot of cars _ a lot of sprawl and new businesses,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was ranked third with 62 days of unhealthy pollution, and
Georgia was fourth with 55. Other Southern states making U.S.
PIRG's ``dirty dozen'' list were Virginia, ranked 11th with 36
days, and Florida, ranked 12th with 33 days.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio was ranked 10th with 38 days.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standards, air is considered dangerously polluted
when concentrations of smog reach .085 parts per million over an
eight-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   US PIRG called on Congress and the EPA to take action to reduce
smog from its two primary sources _ the electric power industry and
motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They urged the EPA to expand its rules requiring summertime cuts
in pollution from power plants in 22 states. The rule should be
nationwide, year-long and should require cuts in other major power
plant pollutants such as sulfur and carbon dioxide, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report urges the EPA to adopt nationwide
emission standards for cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution is especially harmful for the elderly, children,
and people with diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema and
asthma, said Dr. Alfred Munzer, director of pulmonary medicine at
Washington Adventist Hospital and past president of the American
Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``For asthma patients, a smoggy summer means missed work,
staying indoors instead of playing outside, and in too many cases,
spending the day in the emergency room instead of at summer camp,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report compiled and analyzed air quality data for 26 states
and Washington, D.C., where such information is available to the
public. It also used limited information from fifteen other states.
Nine states failed to provide enough data to be included in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Mardock said the report's findings, while severe, probably don't
reflect the gravity of the nation's air quality problem because
many states did not include the months of August or September in
their data. Those months are often some of the worst for smog, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very conservative information,'' she said

`RULES OF THE WILD': STALKING THE SELF IN THE LAND OF SAFARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review.) 
(kd) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All human evil, the French philosopher Blaise Pascal said in
``Pensees,'' comes from ``man's being unable to sit still in a
room.'' That interesting statement is one of many you could find to
illustrate the philosophical futility involved in trying to change
one's destiny by changing one's address _ especially by changing it
to some locale of special beauty and exotica. In her entertaining,
intensely romantic first novel, ``Rules of the Wild,'' Francesca
Marciano presents a young woman from Italy who tries to do just
that, and, as Pascal might have predicted, finds a certain ecstasy
but a good deal more misery.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who is also Ms. Marciano's narrator, is Esmeralda,
who grew up in New York and Rome. When her remote and ardent
father, Ferdinando, a poet of international reputation, dies, Esme,
as she is called, becomes an orphan. She goes off to Kenya with a
boyfriend in search of something strange and therefore something
more intensely felt, or, as she puts it, something that will force
you ``to experience the euphoric horror of floating in emptiness,
your moorings cut for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Esme stays in Africa, becoming a typical Nairobi expatriate who
has nothing to do with Africans. She lives on cappuccino, cocaine
and gossip with her friends, and she spends more money in an
afternoon of shopping than her servants make in a month. She also
falls in love with two virile white men who seem stand-ins for
characters that Hemingway might have created, one an adventurous
war correspondent and the other a game guide for tourists. Caught
between two lovers, neither of whom satisfies her spiritual
longings, Esme struggles with the curse and the beauty of African
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this novel, Ms. Marciano, described on the dust
jacket as a documentary filmmaker who divides her time between Rome
and Kenya, skirts the abyss of self-indulgence. Esme, smart and
poetic as she is, has the bad habit of confounding the
philosophical quandary of voluntary exile with the psychic
inadequacy of bourgeois life. She is a sensualist who denies
herself nothing and experiences deep anguish when she fails to have
what she wants. But at the same time, she is far too intelligent,
too good an observer of herself and her scene, for her
world-weariness to become a pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have servants, we don't pay taxes, we go to lots of dinner
parties, we play explorers over the weekend, we look healthy and
tanned all year round and we can always blame it on the Africans
when things are not running smoothly,'' Esme's best female friend
in Nairobi says. ``It's such a bargain!''
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that there is something more than casually
autobiographical in Esme's reflections on being white in Africa.
Ms. Marciano artfully and graphically captures the bittersweet
quality, the undertone of smugness that often saturates expatriate
life, in Africa or any other place where Europeans and Americans
congregate in search of the Great Elsewhere. Ms. Marciano's scenes
of everyday life are etched in subtle colors. ``Let's be honest
about it,'' Esme tells us near the beginning of her tale. ``This is
a story about white people in Africa.'' The characters are
believable precisely because one can't believe in them. They are
too conscious of being white people in Africa, and too defensively,
cattily contemptuous of white people who are not. Esme is one of
the most compellingly self-absorbed European women to be portrayed
in Africa since Greta Scacchi played the decadent Diana Broughton
in ``White Mischief'' a decade ago. She is more earnest than
Broughton, and devoid of illusions, in control of her mind but not
her furious sentiments. She is capable of something close to
meltdown in confrontations with men, and she suffers her setbacks
with a full heart and just a touch of acidulous self-deprecation, a
sexy Roseanne Arnold of the savanna.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Esme on a masochistic expedition to pick up Claire, a
pretty blond woman arriving from London to live with her boyfriend,
one of the men Esme loves. Leaving the airport, Esme quickly puts
us into the expat scene in Nairobi as she and her friend Nicole
snort coke, smoke cigarettes and shop. (A telling detail: Esme
removes the price tags from her new espresso cups so her servants
won't see how much they cost.) The rest of ``Rules of the Wild'' is
mostly flashback, beginning with Esme's arrival in Africa years
before in the company of an Italian boyfriend she quickly dumps in
favor of Adam, the big-game guide who persuades her to settle in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never thought of myself as a good person,'' she says.
``Too twisted, too unhappy to be good. But now I wanted to be
tamed. I needed to revive my integrity. I knew I could be a better
person than the one I had been lately.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Esme becomes a better person, but she does
learn something from a stormy life in the irritable precincts of
white Africa. Esme's lovers, Adam and Hunter, are amply realized
figures. Hunter, who conquers Esme's heart even as Adam wins her
mind, is a swashbuckling skeptic, a foreign correspondent for an
British newspaper who disappears for long stretches to cover the
genocide in Rwanda. Esme's tortuous pathway between them is
chronicled by Ms. Marciano with a closeness and a perceptiveness
worthy of Flaubert. Her novel, about a woman greedy for love and
beauty and fully aware of that greed, is a charged, emotionally
potent, engaging literary debut.

JAYE P. MORGAN FINDS SWINGING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It's probably due to that pesky Gap commercial, but
``Swing! Swing! Swing!'' is coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   The revue celebrates the booming big-band sound with stars who
were actually alive when this stuff was popular the first time
around, Herb Jeffries and the Sunnysiders among them. Also on
board: Jaye P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on: (begin ital) Jaye P. Morgan? (end ital) The bawdy '70s
game show vet whose career consisted of getting bleeped on ``The
Gong Show''? What's next? Brett Somers as ``Evita?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the public's short memory. Maybe it's that none of
Morgan's songs was all that lasting. But in the '50s, everyone knew
her dark, sultry voice and hits such as ``That's All I Want From
You'' and ``The Longest Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   She will sing some of those in ``Swing! Swing! Swing!'' But
she's bluntly honest about her opinion of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not my concept of great music,'' she says. ``The '50s
were very dull musically. It's a lot like the bouffant hairstyle.
We were very glad once it was out.''
</P>
<P>
   A singer who dismisses her back catalog? That's chutzpah. But
Morgan, 68, has the perspective to separate her personal taste from
what the public expects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a jazz fiend. But I don't judge what I do professionally
with what my personal preference is. I'm a pop singer _ no matter
what I say, that's what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most singers of her time, she was comfortable on TV. When
the hits stopped, she did guest spots and game shows, what most
people remember her for.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what's available,'' she says. ``It doesn't bother me
that people don't know I'm a singer. The whole key is that I'm
still standing in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what was it like working with Chuck Barris and Gene Gene the
Dancing Machine?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gong Show'' was just nutso,'' says Morgan, who never once
says anything bleepable during our chat. ``It was all irreverent
idiocy _ and I know how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That playfulness worked in her other slice of TV immortality. On
an ``Odd Couple'' episode, she crooned Felix's tune ``Happy and
Peppy and Bursting With Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all I've done, that's what people remember,'' a bewildered
Morgan says. ``Probably because they've rerun it 450 million times.
People always want me to sing that song, and I do not remember a
word of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there goes one request. Here's another: Any chance that
she'll warble ``Pepper Hot Baby!,'' a 1955 hit where she crowed,
``Count to a hundred, HOO-HA!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so cruel,'' she says in an explosion of giggles. ``I
went in and recorded that song and never sang it again. Thank
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it never hurts to ask. &QL;

`SWAN LAKE' ON BROADWAY: A LAUGH, PERHAPS A TEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like all recent modern-dress versions of the ballet
classics, Matthew Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' can give one pause.
``Beware of those who stir the waters to suggest they are deep,''
as the Chinese saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bourne, a 38-year-old British modern-dance choreographer
does have something to say about reinterpretation, and it is about
more than replacing women with men in a corps of swan creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Part cartoon, part spoof of the British royal family and part
lyric poem, this rechoreographed ``Swan Lake'' keeps remarkably
close to the story and musical structure of the standard 1895
version of Tchaikovsky's ballet. It may not be as spectacular or
profound as the 19th-century original, but it is a polished
entertainment, clever in its choreography and uninhibited in its
tender moments. It will make you laugh; it might even make you cry.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze of publicity stemming from the production's six-month
run in London in 1996 and a brief engagement in Los Angeles last
year has left the mistaken impression that this is an all-male
version, with men dressed as women. But men are men here and women
are women, and the production is decidedly co-ed.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a mistake to see this version as a homosexual
cult show. The hero, portrayed with remarkable nuance in dancing
and acting by Scott Ambler as a Prince Charles type, is a
melancholy royal heir with a domineering queen mother in 1950s
dress. After he finds pure love in an ideal (a mythic male swan),
he is seduced by its human double, a mod rocker in black leather.
</P>
<P>
   There is a homoerotic tinge to the male duets for Ambler and
Adam Cooper in the dual swan role. (The principal characters have
alternate casts.) But these duets are a springboard for a wider
view of the production as a whole. You don't have to be of a
particular sexual persuasion to have an unhappy childhood and seek
escape in another world, even a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Cooper radiate anything but universal sex appeal.
Intense and powerful, he twists into Bourne's quirky off-balance
shapes for the muscular long-armed swans: with his punk good looks
and mercurial speed, he plunges into the darting, insidious
choreography for the swan's evil opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It is a terrific performance recalling the sexy dramatic vibes
that Cooper, then in the Royal Ballet, gave off here in 1994 as
Rudolf (another prince rejected by a cold mother), the Hapsburg
heir obsessed with women, sex and death in Kenneth MacMillan's
``Mayerling.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bourne's own Prince, confused about his identity and the
stifling court protocol, the point is that Bourne has only souped
up his story's characters; he did not invent them.
</P>
<P>
   Poor old Tchaikovsky's score may have been pushed around over
the last century, with interpolations and cuts, but the essential
plot line of the 1895 ``Swan Lake,'' choreographed by Marius Petipa
and Lev Ivanov, has remained the same. To wit, the hero is a
melancholy prince with a domineering queen mother (she orders him
to quit drinking and to marry) who finds pure love with an ideal,
Odette (a maiden by night, a swan by day). He is also seduced by
the ideal's human double, Odile (commonly known as the black swan).
</P>
<P>
   Does it make a difference that the swan leader is a male? Yes
and no, for actually Bourne has tapped into an age-old literary
symbol with powerful sexual connotations. Think of Zeus transformed
into the swan abducting the Leda of Yeats' imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with that image, Bourne gives the male swans, both
barefoot and bare-chested in feathered knickers designed by Lez
Brotherston, ensemble dances that are predicated on aggressive
poses. Bent over or arching with arms held back as wings, they whip
into distortions of ballet turns. The vocabulary is limited and
unballetic. Nonetheless, Cooper's signature pose in arabesque has
his arm crooked over his head, recalling a famous photograph of
Margot Fonteyn as Odette.
</P>
<P>
   As a choreographer, Bourne is at his sharpest and most inventive
in parodies of social dances. His success is twofold: He offers a
twist on set pieces from the original ballet and also works against
the music's familiar associations.
</P>
<P>
   A scene-setting overture, conducted by David Frame for Bourne's
company, Adventures in Motion Pictures, shows a child Prince
(Andrew Walkinshaw) in bed with a stuffed swan. A vision of Cooper
appears above in the same window in which Cooper will cradle the
boy at the end, symbolizing the soul of a Prince driven to madness
and death.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The heavy stuff is still a long way off as Bourne
uses the music celebrating the birthday of Siegfried, Tchaikovsky's
Prince, to have squads of servants prepare Bourne's hero for his
duties. There are royal in-jokes (a mechanical dog that resembles
Queen Elizabeth's corgi).
</P>
<P>
   As the stage queen, Isabel Mortimer (who alternates with Fiona
Chadwick) exudes both superciliousness and a sly breathlessness
that goes with her implied nymphomania. The same waltz continues as
the Prince greets the populace and acquires an instant girlfriend,
Emily Piercy, who is ill behaved. Like the best of Soviet
choreographers, Bourne knows how to give silent acting a solid
rhythmic dance pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Rothbart, the magician who can release Odette from swanhood if a
man is true to her, is turned here into a scheming private
secretary (Barry Atkinson). He pays off the girlfriend, the owner
of a nightclub where the Prince gets into a scandalous brawl, and
he is obviously in cahoots with Cooper in the ballroom scene.
</P>
<P>
   This new subplot is about plotting. No wonder the Prince gets
little comfort from a spoof of Romantic ballet, danced as the
entertainment usually provided in Act I. Jerome Robbins has been
funnier with butterfly ballets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Much better is a combative groping duet for the mother and the
Prince to express their conflicts, although the drums here are
unusually loud. And even better, to the tinkle of the goblet
polonaise, are the stylized 1960s dances for assorted rough trade
in the disco Ambler visits before superbly performing a disjointed
solo of despair.
</P>
<P>
   The first lakeside scene is by a pond in a park where the Prince
intends to commit suicide but is saved by his vision of swan
heaven. Cooper leads the male corps, all with a black beaklike
stripe on the forehead. The beak is echoed in the swans' cupped
hand gestures. The adagio of discovery for Ambler and Cooper
establishes their ambiguous relationship: embrace and rejection.
The best solo in the production is Cooper's; his fast-flying leaps,
elbow raised, are performed to the music for Odette's solo.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne hits his stride in the subsequent ballroom scene, where
the usual waltz of the fiancees introduces a guest list from hell.
A woman with a black eyepatch is a visiting German Princess, and a
Fergie character with red hair dances on a table. The ethnic
character dances are hilariously spoofed: Jacqueline Anderson and
eight men stamp a great deal in the Spanish Dance and rotate their
wrists so much it all spells hocus-pocus.
</P>
<P>
   But from now on it is Cooper's show. He enters on the edge of a
balcony, licks the queen's arm (she likes it) and brandishes a
riding crop. The black swan pas de deux becomes a struggle between
the Prince and his mother over the same desires. After Cooper
hoists the queen around, she whirls off and Ambler finds himself in
a stylized tango with Cooper, who twists his arm. Just as Odile
mimics Odette, Cooper paints a black stripe on his forehead.
Whatever the Prince finds out about his true self, it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the dramaturgy becomes murky. The Prince rushes
in with a gun but the private secretary shoots the girlfriend and
is prevented from shooting the Prince by the Queen. A coup d'etat?
All is madness as Tchaikovsky's storm music ushers in the now nasty
swans, whose dancing is accelerated and sharp, full of sudden
turns. Why do they attack not only the Prince, but also the swan he
loves? Is it the Prince's dream image of self-destruction, or has
society killed its victims?
</P>
<P>
   Dance and drama are inseparable here, as they are in Petipa and
Ivanov's version of ``Swan Lake.'' Bourne opts for their
19th-century apotheosis. The hero and swan figure unite in an
afterlife, or life as it should be.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His royal highness, the Prince, is face down on the
sidewalk, and if there were a gutter in sight he would no doubt
crawl right into it. It hasn't been a good day. His mother, a
Dior-style version of the Evil Queen in Disney's ``Snow White,''
has made her dissatisfaction with him even clearer than usual by
slapping him; an especially galling moment of public humiliation at
the ballet has already hit the tabloids, and now he has been tossed
out of the louche bar where he sought to forget it all.
</P>
<P>
   But for the audience watching Matthew Bourne's ``Swan Lake,''
the real heartbreak comes after the Prince, played by Scott Ambler,
rises uncertainly to his feet. He wraps his arms around himself in
a barren, solitary embrace; he twirls into a frenzy of
self-disgust. Other gestures breathe a pale hopefulness, and they
are the saddest of all. They are the movements of a lonely, awkward
man aspiring to grace, to connection, to another identity
altogether. It's waiting for him just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Thus goes the brief, gentle scene that prefaces the Prince's
first encounter with a flock of swans in a city park, and when the
eerie, muscular birds make their appearance, it feels less bizarre
than inevitable. You may have heard by now what they look like,
these creatures with the naked torsos of men and white feathered
legs and loins. As led by the stunning young dancer Adam Cooper,
they're as visually akin to satyrs as swans, with a distinctly
feral sensuality. If you had met them earlier, you might have
laughed or winced. As it is, you see them as an answer to an
unhappy man's prayers. No, they definitely aren't human, but then
the Prince, trapped in a world of palaces, protocol and repression,
has had more than his fill of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Not a word is spoken in Bourne's inspired reconception of
Tchaikovsky's storybook ballet, but when you leave the Neil Simon
Theater, you find yourself thinking about specific character and
conflict in the way you do after a juicy drama. ``I've never been
trying to compete with classical ballet,'' Bourne has said. ``What
I'm doing is telling a story.''
</P>
<P>
   The ways in which he does this may be brazen and even vulgar in
their literal-mindedness. Yet there's no shaking off the haunted
longing and anguish at the evening's center. Watching it arouses
the same sensations that good silent movies often do. Initially, it
seems antiquated and melodramatic. As it goes on, it acquires a
soulful lyricism, transcending its more obvious sensationalism and
sentimentality in the way performances of Lillian Gish and Charlie
Chaplin did in films like ``Broken Blossoms'' and ``City Lights.''
Clearly, there is an argument to be made for muteness in the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne, splendidly assisted by the Edward Goreyesque set and
costume designs of Lez Brotherston and the Hurell-style lighting of
Rick Fisher, sets up his psychological framework carefully. Mind
you, it isn't subtle. The oppressive life of the Prince, which
deliberately evokes the contemporary soap operas of Buckingham
Palace, is signaled by outsize images of crowns and the mechanical
rituals of royalty and the people who bow and toady to them.
</P>
<P>
   There will surely be those who object to the stark Freudianism
in the portrayal of the Prince's mother (the elegantly hot-and-cold
Fiona Chadwick), a tight-lipped monarch who keeps her son at a
forbidding distance while treating her own royal guard as a sexual
candy store. As for all those satiric visions of paparazzi and
decadent hangers-on, including an evil palace secretary (Barry
Atkinson) and the Prince's unsuitable girlfriend (Emily Piercy,
bringing to mind a skinny Duchess of York) _ well, haven't we seen
too much of all that recently?
</P>
<P>
   These elements take on a flavorful piquancy, however, when
contrasted to the interior life of its central figure, first seen
as a boy (Andrew Walkinshaw) clutching a stuffed animal that is, of
course, a swan. Making ``Swan Lake'' a psychological portrait that
happens inside its hero's head is nothing new to dance. But Bourne
is particularly clear in aligning our perspective with that of a
Prince, a man who has never come to terms with his public or sexual
identities.
</P>
<P>
   This is clear in everything from the parody
ballet-within-the-ballet, attended by the Prince and his mother, in
which an evil goblin figure sports repulsive genitals that look
like a fungus, to the climactic nervous breakdown, staged as an
Expressionist counterpoint of shadow and glaring light reminiscent
of ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.'' In between are the two
centerpiece dances, that of the swans and that of the revelers at a
palace ball, which contrast an idealized (if still menacing)
eroticism with its cheaper, real-life incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper is the catalyst in both dances, Bourne's answer to the
Good and Evil Swans, Odette and Odile, and he is electrically
compelling as each of these antithetical objects of desire. The
evening's solid ballast, however, is Ambler, looking like a cross
between Prince Charles and Siegfried Sassoon. His face and body
channel and elucidate the dissonance and pain in Tchaikovsky's
score (vigorously directed by David Frame and orchestrated by David
Cullen), the work of a man who was, after all, a most troubled
soul.
</P>
<P>
   One final word: though the Prince's longings (like those of
Tchaikovksy) are obviously homoerotic, this ``Swan Lake'' is not,
to borrow from Tony Kushner, exclusively a ``gay fantasia.'' The
sensuality of Cooper's swan is, while unquestionably physical,
somehow beyond carnal desire. It embodies that abstract, strangely
virginal eroticism that sometimes filters through dreams. Worldly
glamour is small-time and nasty in this ``Swan Lake''; the flesh is
made for cheap thrills. Who wouldn't choose to live in the Prince's
swan-filled dreams?

the case of the Lexus LX 470 and its virtually identical cousin,
the Toyota Land Cruiser. Both full-sized sport utilities, priced
between $46,500 and $57,000, were redesigned and introduced in
April. Toyota had predicted the less expensive Land Cruiser would
outsell the LX 470. Instead, sales of the pricier LX 470 has

MAJORITY OF TEENS ARE SEXUALLY ABSTINENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For the first time in 20 years, a majority of American teenagers
are sexually abstinent, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control.
 &HT;    ''Compared with 1991, the prevalence of sexual experience in
1997 decreased 11 percent,'' said the CDC. What's particularly
amazing is that sexually active male students fell by an even
larger 15 percent, from 57.4 percent to 48.8 percent who are
sexually active. Teen females experiencing intercourse dropped only
slightly from 50.8 percent in 1991 to 47.7 percent.
 &HT;    This is a major turnaround. The percentage of sexually active
girls aged 15-19 had jumped from only 29 percent in 1970 to 57
percent in 1988.
 &HT;    What is behind this remarkable transformation of ethics?
 &HT;    I give credit to the Southern Baptist's campaign called ''True
Love Waits'' under the leadership of Richard Ross, of the Baptist's
Life Way Christian Resources. He developed a campaign challenging
teens to sign pledge cards to remain sexually pure until marriage.
 &HT;    The pledge is eloquent: ''Believing that TRUE LOVE WAITS, I make
a commitment to God, myself, my family, those I date, my future
mate and my future children to be sexually pure until the day I
enter a covenant marriage relationship.''
 &HT;    In the early 1990s when the campaign began, public schools were
beginning to distribute condoms to reduce AIDS. To suggest that
teens might be persuaded to remain sexually abstinent was
considered naive at best or downright laughable. ''It is easier to
break a promise than a condom,'' said critics.
 &HT;    Yet the Journal of the American Medical Association reported
last month that ''Adolescents who reported having taken a pledge to
remain a virgin were at significantly lower risk of early age of
sexual debut. Nearly 16 percent of females and 10 percent of males
reported making such pledges.''
 &HT;    Those percentages translate into 2.5 million teens who have
pledged to be remain pure!
 &HT;    One strategy to motivate teenagers to sign the covenants was the
gathering of hundreds of thousands of signed pledges into a public
display. The first was in 1994 when 211,000 cards were planted for
blocks on the grassy mall between the Capitol and the Washington
Monument.
 &HT;    Why was this significant?
 &HT;    ''Teenagers often feel disenfranchised and routinely ignored by
adults when they have something important to say,'' said Ross.
''The display of pledge cards provides a way for teenage voices to
be heard by adults and the culture.''
 &HT;    The Washington display of signed pledges of purity on the
national mall was a watershed event. ''Before that date, abstinence
was rarely included in the national discourse on teenage sexual
involvement. Hearing that many teenage voices espousing a value
together caught the national attention of adults, educators, policy
makers and even parents,'' he said.
 &HT;    ''Now rarely is there public discussion of teenage sexuality
without abstinence being included as a viable topic of
discussion.''
 &HT;    In 1996, True Love Waits held a ''Through the Roof'' event in
Atlanta when a stack of 350,000 cards stretched from the floor of
the Georgia Dome to the ceiling with many left over.
 &HT;    On Feb. 12, 1999, hundreds of towns will organize their own
displays of pledge cards spanning a local bridge. On one side the
kids will plant a big sign with the year 1999 on it and 2000 on the
opposite side, symbolizing the span from one millennia to the next
with a strong commitment to moral purity by America's youth.
 &HT;    Will the teenagers of your church get involved?
 &HT;    Perhaps not, if your church is not Southern Baptist, Assembly of
God or Nazarene. I have been disappointed that only a few
evangelical denominations have joined this great campaign for
purity. Roman Catholics initially pledged cooperation, but the
number of Hispanic teens who are sexually active has not declined.
Where are the United Methodists, Presbyterians or any African
American denomination?
 &HT;    Any church could launch its own True Love Waits campaign by
using a new manual on how to do so for $14.95 plus shipping. Call
(800) 545-2766.
 &HT;    Challenge your kids to join this great crusade for moral purity.
 &HT;    Two teens recently told the Surgeon General why they signed up
5-6 years ago when they were in junior high. ''I thought it was a
good idea to stay pure for my future wife, so that it (sex) is
something sacred between my wife and I,'' said Brad Tomas. Monica
DePaz hoped by signing it to ``influence another teenager to make
that pledge.''
 &HT;    The Surgeon General was moved to confess he had had ``too little
to say'' about teen abstinence, but will now support chaste
teenagers.

<P>
   TOPIARY-GARDENS-HNS (Portsmouth, R.I.) _ Edward Scissorhands
would have felt at home in the Green Animals Topiary Garden
overlooking Narragansett Bay. The artistry the movie android
displayed in turning living plants into fascinating shapes can be
seen here in the spiraling shrubs, geometric forms, ornamental
designs and in the menagerie. By Mark Sommer.
</P>
<P>
   BARBADOS-TRAVEL-COX (Barbados) _ Tourists looking for the
``untouched'' Caribbean are in for a disappointment in Barbados.
There are no volcanoes or rain forests, and hardly any rivers. But
there are plenty of white sand beaches and lots of brighly painted
villages, flowering trees and open pastures. There are also a wide
variety of historic sites, dating back to the 17th century. There
are, for example, fabulous castles and forts to visit. Also, this
small island off South America's northern coast still retains
British influence and customs. Most people have high teas, even in
the middle of hot afternoons. By Shelley Emling.
</P>
<P>
   VERMONT-VILLAGE-HNS (Weston, Vt.) _ Vermont can help you go back
to a place you never want to leave. In tiny Weston, for example,
there is an oval village green, an old mill dam, the restored 1797
Farrar-Mansur House and the Weston Priory, a Benedictine monastery
which welcomes the public to daily prayer. There's also the Vermont
Country Store, nostalgia central to southern Vermont. By Kate
Gurnett.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SANCTUARIES-HNS (Florence, Italy) _ Most of the year, a
convent here serves as home to an aging group of Franciscan nuns
and as a residence for young women attending college or graduate
school nearby. Off-season, the convent joins the some 2,000
religious houses worldwide that accept travelers for short stays
and guests for longer periods of quiet reflection. By Cecile S.
Holmes.

been around for about 150 years in New England. That's because
before that the trees had all been logged away. By Lois Shea.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ST.PETERSBURG-SPI (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Often called
``The Venice of the North'' for its architecture, beauty and
setting by water, St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 by Peter the
Great, who created out of a swamp the most northerly of the world's
great cities. The headstrong czar laid the foundation after his
victory over the Swedes in the Great Northern War. Nearly 300 years
later, in touring the city, Americans will feel almost on a
military timetable while visiting such famous attractions as the
Hermitage and the Peter and Paul Fortress. By Joel Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   HOSTELS-MAIN-COX (Undated) _ Two skiers were complaining about
the high price of lift tickets as we stood in line on the side of a
mountain in the exclusive ski town of Breckenridge, Colo. But I
really didn't care how much the lift tickets were because I had
already saved the real money. I wasn't staying in a $250-a-night
condo. I was paying $15 a night at a youth hostel. And that
included breakfast. By Cherly Blackerby.
</P>
<P>
   HOSTELS-RUSTIC-COX (Brunswick, Ga.) _ ``Mom, it's me. In case
you never hear from me again, I am calling from a place called The
Hostel in the Forest in Brunswick, Ga. I'm a little nervous about
staying here overnight. This guy from Germany gave me a tour of the
place _ he's a little scary-looking....'' And so begins one
person's adventure at a bare-bones hostel. By Cara Anna.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-NAPA-VALLEY-HNS (Undated) _ I've been visiting
California's Napa Valley for more than 20 years; honeymooned there
once, in fact. And despite the too-often materialistic trappings of
Disneyland, it remains _ in part and certain parcels _ a magical
place for folks like me from the muggy flatlands. By Michael
Lonsford.

   APOCALYPTIC-RAPTURE (Undated) _ In an instant, millions of
people disappear from the face of the Earth, shedding clothing,
shoes, eyeglasses, jewelry. Were they snatched by aliens? Vaporized
by a spontaneous chemical reaction? No, what has occurred is the
Rapture. Jesus Christ has returned to take the genuine Christians
to heaven. So goes the plot of ``Left Behind,'' a series of four
books of apocalyptic fiction that have now sold nearly 3 million
copies _ as many as a John Grisham novel and have now ascended to
the top four slots on religion best-sellers lists. The ``Left
Behind'' phenomenon is one indication of the public's fixation on
the approaching millenium and the widespread anticipation that the
year 2000 portends some Earth-shattering event. By Laurie
Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   WHATDREAMS-HEAVEN-COX _ Heaven is a safe place. Heaven is fun,
full of color, filled with angels, a good place to visit and the
house of God. That's what some kids at St. Ann Roman Catholic
School in West Palm Beach, Fla. think about heaven. Last week, they
drew pictures of what heaven looks like to them. Some of them have
a more mature faith than many adults. A tie-in to the new release,
``What Dreams May Come.'' By Steve Gushee.

   NY-CHURCH-ADVERTISING-NYT (New York) _ God's messenger these

missionary. Religious advertisements have become savvier, slicker
and certainly wittier than the staid church announcements found on
the religion pages of newspapers. By Nadine Brozan.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ Whether or not anyone has cited
the story of David and Bathsheba either to defend or denounce
President Clinton on Sunday morning television, plenty of people
have done so in the Sunday morning pulpits. Quite a few of them
have even called Walter Brueggemann, professor of Old Testament at
Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., for advice.
Brueggemann is the author of a commentary for preaching on First
and Second Samuel, the two books in the Hebrew Scriptures that tell
the story of ancient Israel's transformation from a constellation
of tribes to a centralized monarchy under Saul and David. It is
also where the story of David and Bathsheba appears. By Peter
Steinfels.
</P>

SUBSTITUTE MAILMAN? TIME TO GO POSTAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURIE NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The police department was mad at me.
</P>
<P>
   It was all documented in a letter they sent me saying that
because I had ignored a certified letter they had mailed regarding
a false burglar alarm at our house, I now owed them 74 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   This was curious, I thought. I hadn't received or signed for a
certified letter, but it really didn't surprise me. Ever since my
regular mailman _ the best, most dutiful civil servant the
government ever created, who has never once lost a piece of my mail
or shot a fellow worker _ had cut back his hours during the summer,
things had gone horribly awry. The substitute mail people were a
roguish lot, delivering my unemployment checks to everyone in the
neighborhood except me and leaving the rest of my mail on the
ground, if they even came by to deliver it at all.
</P>
<P>
   I've had experiences with nasty mail people before, including
one mailman at my old house who knocked on my door one day during
the holiday season and announced, ``It's Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho, ho, ho!'' I said back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the time of giving,'' he emphasized, deadpan. ``And I
give to you every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, OK,'' I said hesitantly, getting his hint. ``Hang on!''
</P>
<P>
   I ran into the kitchen to find an appropriate gift and ran back
to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy holidays,'' I said, placing three cigarettes and a
frozen Hungry Jack waffle in his hand. ``I picked up a big-screen
TV for you, but the pest-control guy spotted it while he was
spraying for fleas, and, well, he promised me he wouldn't dilute
next time and gave me some ointment for the bites.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, my mailbox was overflowing with all the Valu-Paks,
Kmart fliers and Peter Piper Pizza coupons that should have
rightfully gone to Glendale. I decided to shoot back, to play
tough, and left the 10 pounds of post-consumer recycled material
just where the Grinch had left it, refusing to take it into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, the creaks of the hinges echoed through the
hollow cave of the mailbox as I pulled the door down, and I smiled.
It was empty. I picked up a branch from a dead tumbleweed in my
yard and stuck it in the mailbox, afraid that the nut had put a
scorpion or dog doody way in the back. When I pulled out the stick,
a single piece of yellow paper fluttered to the ground at my feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``THIS RESIDENCE,'' it shouted, ``IS DECLARED VACANT BY THE
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE.''
</P>
<P>
   The mailman had won, and my mail service didn't resume until I
grudgingly presented the mailman with a stun gun and gift
subscription to ``Penthouse.'' After that, I knew better than to
complain or mouth off in person to anyone wearing short black socks
and a visor. Their power is more obscene _ and far more
encompassing _ than Kenneth Starr's.
</P>
<P>
   I attempted to rectify the false-alarm bill by calling the
police department and explaining my mail situation, but they told
me that my only recourse was to write a letter to the alarm unit in
an attempt to get the charges dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   I gave it a shot, writing down all of the bad things the
substitute mailman had done, and just to be sure that there was no
hanky-panky going on, I drove to the post office and mailed it from
there. Three weeks later, I received a reply from a guy named
Harold, who, very simply put, said that he did not believe me.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, my husband and I were coming home from dinner,
and as we climbed the steps to the porch, he looked up and then
pointed. ``What's that?'' he said as we both stared at the huge,
looming object hovering in the rafters of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a message,'' I said quietly as my husband tried
to reach it. My worst fears were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a package from J. Crew, containing a cute little sundress
that I thought I'd be skinny enough to wear when I was on my diet.
It was also about two weeks overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's telling me to back off,'' I said to my husband in a
panic. ``He's telling me I've gone too far this time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's telling you?'' he asked me in a whisper. ``If you're
talking to God, would you ask him where I put that Foreigner CD?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The substitute mailman!'' I shouted. ``Don't you understand?
This is a horse's head! He found out about my letter to the police
department! It's a warning! Now, if anyone, even your brother, asks
you to go fishing in a small little rowboat, you say no unless you
want to sleep with the fishes!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Italian talk!'' he replied. ``You know I don't
understand Italian talk!''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I waited to see what would happen. I posted myself
by the window for hours to make sure I saw the substitute mailman
when he came, positive that he was going to try and slip me another
message, like a severed ear wrapped in a yellow vacant-house
notice.
</P>
<P>
   I heard him shuffle up the path. I heard him whistle. I heard
him open the slot to the mailbox. And then a miracle happened. As I
peeked out the window, I saw him standing in my yard. He waved. My
old mailman, the best mailman in the world, was back.
</P>
<P>
   I ran down the porch steps and threw my arms around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're back!'' I cried. ``So many bad things have happened
since you left!''
</P>
<P>
   I told him all about the police letter, the missing unemployment
checks and the J. Crew package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on the roof?'' he asked in disbelief. ``Boy, I sure am
sorry. Makes me feel guilty for all of that time I spent fishing on
the lake this summer. I just got a little Coleman rowboat. It's a
beauty! You should come with me sometime!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks for the invitation,'' I said, trying not to
flinch, ``but I have to spend all of my time working so I can buy
you a big-screen TV for Christmas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a Taser?'' he asked with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on my way to the gun store!'' I laughed. ``ZZZZZ!!!'' &QL;

SCOTTSDALE RATED TOPS FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., - Theresa Romero nestled into a lounge chair
a Scottsdale spa, sipping ice water and awaiting a massage. She was
hard at work, really, laboring to zap stress from her life.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask`` Ladies Home Journal,'' she came to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   The bastion of words for women has dubbed Scottsdale the
nation's least stressful city for women and ranked the city third
overall for women's quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And, the woman at the city's helm says, who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a wonderful quality of life here,'' Mayor Sam
Campana says. ``It's like a perpetual vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine states that _ in addition to being the nation's
``most chilled-out'' city _ Scottsdale ranks third-highest behind
Ann Arbor, Mich., and Madison, Wisc., for women overall. Phoenix
ranked 81st.
</P>
<P>
   The article, which is to hit newsstands Tuesday, cites low
crime, divorce and unemployment rates and good health practices
among the reasons the city is ideal for women.
</P>
<P>
   The study also considered a ``beauty index,'' in which it judged
cities based on such criteria as the number of potential bad hair
days.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale didn't fare as well in the beauty vain. Blame it on
the bone-dry air and cloudless days, said Margot Gilman, the
article's editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a little humidity for body,'' she said. ``And
sunshine, well, that's bad for the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero, a businesswoman and mother of two who has lived in
Scottsdale her whole life, and her husband, Rene, lounged at
Scottsdale's Stress Less Step to relax.
</P>
<P>
   They think the city's trademark restaurants, resorts, golf
courses and nightspots add to an easygoing lifestyle in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as a city, I'd say this is definitely one of the least
stressful cities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The city also emerged from the study with an additional
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its spectacular setting of desert scapes and mountains, plus
fiery sunsets and a smorgasbord of five-star restaurants, also
lands Scottsdale in our top 10 romantic cities,'' the article
states.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine rated the cities based on crime, jobs, lifestyle,
health, education, politics, child care and economy.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale ranked high in public safety, politics and economy in
particular, Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   The city also scored big because the mayor, city attorney,
school district superintendent and second in command in the police
department are women, Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at how large a share of the political power
structure was held by women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also considered such factors as the number of
women's doctors, sexual harassment claims filed and crimes against
women reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Women in Scottsdale) should just celebrate where they are and
what they've got,'' Gilman said. &QL;

AFC'S COUP OVER RIVAL CONFERENCE APPEARS TO BE SUCCEEDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five weeks of NFL football are behind us, and
one thing has become clear: Nobody should be surprised if the AFC
starts owning the league the way the NFC once did.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC proved the better conference in January when Denver
upset Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXII. The win stunned many, but
those paying close attention could have seen a subtle transition in
the making, one that is obvious today.
</P>
<P>
   AFC teams have won 15 of the 20 interconference games this year.
That's a winning percentage of 75 percent and a mark that
represents where the league's strength lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people want to try and figure it out,'' said Oakland
Raiders senior assistant coach Bruce Allen. ``But I don't know if
there's a way it can be figured out. Denver is a good team. Kansas
City is a good team. Seattle is a good team. Unfortunately, those
three are all in our division, but there are just good teams in the
AFC.''
</P>
<P>
   There are substantially more good teams in the AFC than in the
NFC. Denver hasn't fallen from its Super Bowl standard.
Jacksonville, undefeated like the Broncos, has been a popular pick
to be playing for the Super Bowl. The Chiefs are strong, Seattle
and Miami are better and Pittsburgh will resolve its problems.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on and on because there are few NFC teams to
interrupt the flow in that chain of thought. Only Green Bay, the
49ers and Minnesota rank among the top 10 teams at this stage. It's
a toss-up as to who else from that conference could be deserving of
a playoff spot when postseason rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has pulled a Carolina. Atlanta and New Orleans, both
3-1, are operating under smoke screens. And as for the NFC East ...
well let's not even go there.
</P>
<P>
   This is about the AFC right now. It's been a long time since
this conference could stake a legitimate claim to being the
dominant sector. AFC teams finished 31-28-1 in interconference
games last season and 32-28 in 1996. Prior to those two seasons,
the conference was 27-33, 25-27, 27-25, 22-30, 19-33 and 26-26
dating back to 1990. The AFC's best season ever against the NFC was
1979, when it won 69.2 percent of the games (36-16).
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two conferences comes down to two
factors: quarterbacks and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the significance of the signal-caller, let's point
to the Raiders. They're 3-2, with their victories coming against
NFC East teams. Two of the three quarterbacks they faced in those
games (the New York Giants' Danny Kanell and Arizona's Jake
Plummer) already have thrown a combined 15 interceptions. The other
guy, Jason Garrett, is hoping to just keep Dallas afloat until Troy
Aikman returns.
</P>
<P>
   If the Raiders are feasting on NFC mediocrity, just imagine
what's going on with the rest of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NFC has the best quarterback in football in Brett
Favre as well as Steve Young and Aikman, the talent level after the
big three isn't impressive. Minnesota has two good ones in reserve
Randall Cunningham and injured starter Brad Johnson, and Atlanta's
Chris Chandler and Chicago's Eric Kramer are underrated, but
there's little else.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC trots out John Elway, Dan Marino, Drew Bledsoe and Mark
Brunell, and also boasts of a better stable of young talent. Peyton
Manning, Ryan Leaf, Steve McNair, Kordell Stewart (though he's only
completing passes in commercials) and Buffalo's Rob Johnson have
bright futures.
</P>
<P>
   What does the NFC have in its youth movement besides Plummer and
Detroit's Charlie Batch? Tony Banks? Danny Wuerffel? Bobby Hoying?
They'll be holding clipboards by the millennium, which is a nice
segue because it brings us to the men they'll be standing next to.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know where some of the NFC's best coaches went,
just look to the other conference. Miami's Jimmy Johnson and the
New York Jets' Bill Parcells have two Super Bowl rings each from
their NFC tenures, and the last time the 49ers won the Super Bowl,
Denver's Mike Shanahan was calling the plays.
</P>
<P>
   All the NFC has to hang its hat on these days is its heavy
hitters. The Packers and 49ers are still among the top four teams
in football and Minnesota is closing fast. Each has a potent
offense and a coach schooled in the Bill Walsh mind-set, but the
wealth of imagination has spread itself around the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   NFC teams once dominated because they were more physical. They
also won with creative offensive systems that finessed opponents
into frustration. But those factors that helped them capture 13
straight Super Bowls titles prior to Denver's win aren't so
intimidating, and the most of their teams live on the wrong side of
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Broncos told us the balance of power was
shifting in the NFL. Now we're realizing just how much.

<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: For all the talk
of duty and Constitution Thursday, it was not all that difficult
for the House to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton. The more troublesome question is how Congress will bring
to a conclusion the impeachment process that Rep. Henry Hyde called
``this venture, this excursion, this journey.'' By Alison Mitchell.

<P>
   CLINTON-VOTE (Washington) _ As he opened two hours of debate
over whether the House should initiate impeachment proceedings,
Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned
Republicans and Democrats alike that ``too much hangs in the
balance for us not to rise above partisan politics.'' Yet the
quarreling on the House floor was plainly partisan. So was the
258-176 subsequent vote as only 31 of the 206 House Democrats
joined the Republican majority and signed on to the resolution for
an open-ended impeachment inquiry. By Richard L. Berke.

   NEW YORK _ You, too, can stand where Leona Helmsley stood: on
the steps of the only palace in the world where the Queen stood
trial. Or, you can go off in quest of your own personal Elvis
sighting, at the army depot where the newly drafted King shipped
out.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Courthouse on Foley Square and the Brooklyn Army
Terminal, the settings for these momentous civic occasions, are
just two of the seven buildings included in the third annual Open
House, a self-guided tour sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown
New York. This year, the event celebrates the architecture of Cass
Gilbert, a pivotal figure in defining the public face of New York
in the early years of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Or faces, rather, for Gilbert showed that the city's prevailing
civic spirit could wear more than one visage. Gothic,
neo-classical, Beaux-Arts; Georgian, even proto-Modern: the Gilbert
Open House offers a feast of architectural styles, an eclectic
range unsurpassed by any architect in New York before or since.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gilbert did his best to make each building faithful to
its chosen style _ ``as pure as I can make it,'' in the architect's
words _ he also helped fashion New York's image as a wondrous,
latter-day Babel, a metropolis as polyglot in its architecture as
in its surging immigrant population.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert was himself an immigrant, of sorts, a native of the
Midwest who came to New York to hit the big time. After a two-year
apprenticeship in New York with McKim, Mead &AMP; White starting in
1880, Gilbert spent the next two decades building his reputation in
Minnesota until he won a highly sought commission in 1899 to build
the new United States Custom House at the tip of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ship's come in.'' he wrote to his wife. ``She's in the
harbor now!'' And the harbor would never be the same. His buildings
would go on to shape the city in the image of a great mountain to
be scaled by the culturally ambitious, an Everest of desire. With
structures like the Woolworth, West Street and Broadway-Chambers
buildings, Gilbert helped plant the seeds for what Kurt Vonnegut
would later call Skyscraper National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse is a good place to begin the self-guided tour. A
small survey of Gilbert's career is on view in the lobby, and a
guidebook, with an excellent text by Anthony Robins, is also
available. But I would suggest the Broadway-Chambers Building as a
preliminary stop. Completed in 1900, this was Gilbert's first New
York building. It offers a good introduction to what made him tick.
</P>
<P>
   A pragmatist, Gilbert once described skyscrapers as machines for
making the land pay. But he also believed that beauty was essential
to the proper working of the machine. His buildings both
embellished and sublimated the connection between beauty and money,
the equation that makes New York go around.
</P>
<P>
   How easily New York digests buildings once acclaimed as
masterpieces. Today it's possible to walk right by and not even
yawn. But, on the Broadway-Chambers building's completion in 1900,
the critic Montgomery Schuyler praised it as the finest skyscraper
in town.
</P>
<P>
   Models and drawings were shown that year at the Paris
Exposition, where Parisians were awed by the building's 18 stories
and gave it a prize.
</P>
<P>
   This building type suffered from low esteem. People regarded it,
with reason, as a monster of commerce. Gilbert gave it a reason to
hold its height up high. Architects had already established the
analogy with the classical column, dividing it into the tripartite
arrangement of base, shaft and capital.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert refined the proportions between these elements and
articulated them by using different materials for each: stone base,
brick shaft, terra cotta crown. The brickwork, red flecked with
blue, is especially fine. In contrast with the light-colored stone
and terra cotta, it gives an almost colonial feel to an otherwise
classically conceived structure. Garlands, cornucopias and a
polychrome penthouse arcade garnish the composition.
</P>
<P>
   The building was completed the same year Freud published ``The
Interpretation of Dreams,'' a book that still sheds light on the
sublimation of desire embodied by this building. The craving for
money, represented by height, and the longing for beauty, signified
by classical style, spiral round each other into the sky. This is
architecture for a city that pays top dollar for the most
conspicuous beauty, if not always the best.
</P>
<P>
   At the Woolworth Building, two blocks south, financial gain is
wedded to religiosity as well as beauty, with Gothic tracery that
seeks to render this ``Cathedral of Commerce'' into the
ecclesiastical tradition of Chartres. But how could even
Woolworth's towering spire compete with the soaring skyline then
taking form?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a misty architectural shape is taking up into itself
like individual building stones, the skyscrapers, tenements,
thoroughfares, and people; and with the mass of them erecting a
tower higher than any of them, even the highest, toward the sky,''
wrote the critic Paul Rosenfeld in 1925, when the Woolworth
Building, once the world's tallest, was relatively new. But Gilbert
carved some of that tower's most impressive stones.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert was often ornate but seldom opulent. His buildings don't
offer the voluptuous sensuality analyzed by Suzannah Lessard in
``The Architect of Desire,'' her book about her grandfather,
Stanford White.
</P>
<P>
   This may reflect a difference between clients as well as eras.
White's clients wanted to flaunt wealth, Gilbert's preferred to
earn it. In the lobby of the Woolworth Building, a sculpted
caricature shows the merchant Frank W. Woolworth diligently
counting nickels and dimes, while a carving of the architect
clutches a model of his design: beauty for sale.
</P>
<P>
   All those in favor of abolishing the income tax please report to
the Collector's office at the Alexander Hamilton Customs House on
Bowling Green. Through this building passed a hefty chunk of the
federal budget. At the turn of the century, in the pre-income tax
era, the nation's revenues derived largely from customs duty, and a
big piece of it washed up here.
</P>
<P>
   This building was a machine for making the ocean pay, a function
clearly expressed in the ornate decoration of the Collector's
office, with its motif of gilded scallop shells and cornucopias,
punctuated by an occasional pineapple, a symbol of hospitality.
Looking out the window toward Broadway extending north, you feel as
if you're in the one-time inner sanctum of the capital of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Traders declared the value of their cargo at the elliptical desk
in the building's grand rotunda, then shuffled across the corridor
to pay tariffs (the cashier's grilles were retained in a handsome
restoration of the building by Ehrenkrantz and Eckstut in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   This cash cow, the most ornate of Gilbert's Beaux-Arts
buildings, is now home to the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern
District of New York. It also houses the colorful treasures of the
George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary critics evidently found it painful to praise
Gilbert's West Street Building (1905-07), as if skyscrapers were
still something to be embarrassed about. The Caliban has become _
if not Ariel _ human, at all events, wrote Claude Bragdon, of a
building that now stands in the shadow of those Caliban Twins, the
World Trade Center towers.
</P>
<P>
   The West Street Building had a rooftop restaurant, too, called
the Garret, nestled beneath Gilbert's mansard roof. But here the
wedding cake top itself looks edible.
</P>
<P>
   An Edwardian, high-rise version of a Loire chateau, this
commercial building once stood at the edge of the Hudson and now
gazes toward Battery Park City. Louis Sullivan would have stopped
at the 16th floor, but Gilbert kept right on going, trimming the
top with a three-story arcade and a row of dormer windows peering
out through Gothic trefoils.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Open House originated with officials of the
U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Gilbert's last
building. I have particular affection for the United States
Courthouse. It graces the view from my window. The gilded pyramid
at the top, illuminated after dark, is a friendly neighbor to have
on longer winter nights. During the day, it's pleasing to take out
the binoculars and scan the steps for rogues.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the public will have access to the appeals court on
the building's 17th floor. But the exterior of the courthouse is
more impressive than the spaces inside. Gilbert had designed the
United States Supreme Court building in Washington, and this was to
be its New York counterpart, the focal point of the architect's
unrealized vision for a monumental civic plaza. Yet even here,
justice stretches toward skyline heights, with a tower rising from
a base of colonnades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though the courthouse's front stairs are a New York
institution, the building is a strangely alien presence: a
Midwestern office building atop a Washington refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Le Corbusier included a picture of the Brooklyn Army Terminal in
his 1925 ``Toward a New Architecture,'' a book that changed the
course of architecture in this century. It is the great revelation
of Sunday's Open House. A pair of poured concrete structures joined
by three bridges, the terminal was designed and completed in less
than a year. Here, toward the end of World War I, men, munitions
and other supplies arrived by train, were unloaded through
cantilevered balconies overhead, and transferred to waiting ships.
</P>
<P>
   Though devoid of period style, the complex is frankly Beaux-Arts
in its massing, proportions and window detail. The plan, which uses
three bridges to connect two warehouses, betrays a classical sense
of organization. So does the axial symmetry of the terminal's most
spectacular space: the atrium where the trains pulled in.
</P>
<P>
   Normally closed to the public, this might be called a cathedral
of industry, and it shows why modernists like Le Corbusier believed
that functional design could rise to the level of high art. A pity
that an opaque canopy now covers the train platform. You must
strain your neck to take in the full impact of the staggered
balconies that rise seven stories above the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   You have to arrive at Pier 11 in Manhattan by 2 p.m. to catch
the free ferry service to the Brooklyn Army Terminal. This is a
shame, because Gilbert's concrete tour de force would be a perfect
climax to the day.
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the ferry back, you can salute Elvis, or at
least a picture of him that hangs in the Terminal's lobby. Bye,
bye, Birdie.
</P>

`THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS': RAW AND BEAUTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This year's New York Film Festival concludes on a
note of uncommon grace. ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' to be shown on
Sunday night, begins simply and becomes a glimpse into an
unexpected world. Though its two main characters, young Frenchwomen
adrift and living hand to mouth, are rough-edged and scrappy, they
wind up forming a bond of enormous delicacy. As that bond frays,
this impassioned first feature by Erick Zonca reveals a soulful,
moving vision of our shared responsibility for one another's lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a film whose two stars jointly won best actress honors at
Cannes this year, the most immediately unforgettable figure is
Elodie Bouchez's Isa (short for Isabelle). At 21, she's a scruffy
opportunist toting her backpack through Lille, raising pocket money
by hustling religious pictures to passers-by. She takes a factory
job as a seamstress, failing dismally but winding up with a fellow
worker, Marie (Natacha Regnier) as her new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Marie couldn't care less about being a seamstress either. In a
film that easily incorporates class struggle into its story and
cares more about working-class experience than many a more openly
political drama, she too lives strictly in the moment. Both women
are at an adventurous age, looking for opportunity wherever they
find it and working only because they must. Then, with the lovelorn
blindness of a Dreiser heroine, Marie hitches her hopes to a
wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   Zonca, who cares more about emotional fire than social realism,
depicts Marie's love affair with furious intimacy. It begins in a
most unexpected way. Isa and Marie have been happily taunting
bouncers at a club, mostly just for sport; Marie even has an affair
with one of them (a hefty biker, played with incongruous tenderness
by Patrick Mercado). The women have also harassed smug-looking
Chriss (Gregoire Colin), without realizing that he is the club's
owner. One day Chriss spots slim, pretty Marie while she is
shoplifting a jacket and saves her from arrest. Rebellious but also
secretly impressed, Marie lets Chriss buy the jacket and buy her,
too.
</P>
<P>
   With her big, toothy grin and rough features, Ms. Bouchez's Isa
looks like the plainer of the two women at first. But as she rises
to the occasion of befriending the badly confused Marie, she takes
on an astonishing radiance, a glow of stirring compassion. ``She
gave out an impression of serenity, grace and absolute confidence
in life,'' Zonca has said of the young woman who inspired this
story, and the luminous Ms. Bouchez (whose credits include Andre
Techine's ``Wild Reeds'') summons that same spirit magnificently
here. In the subplot from which the title comes, Isa learns of a
comatose young girl (whose apartment she and Marie happen to be
sharing) and avidly makes herself the girl's guardian, sharing in
her fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' escalates with frightening urgency
as Marie loses her bearings. Wise in the ways of stubbornly
wrongheaded love affairs, Zonca shows how sexually responsive she
is to Chriss' cruelty, and how easily sexual desperation drives a
wedge between the friends when Isa counsels caution. In scenes of
tumultuous intimacy, he watches the two feisty heroines fight out
their differences. The two actresses perform with overwhelming
naturalness, as if utterly locked into this conflict. Zonca had
them live together while making the film, and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this beautifully acted drama, as raw and immediate
as it is heartfelt, describes much more than the fallout from
friendship or a headstrong love affair. It leaves behind what Isa
has discovered: The profound ties among the lives that are seen
here, and the way those ties make sense of our world.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcia has some serious boy problems. She's gaga for
Mike, the handsome new crooner over at that slick dive, Noam
Pearlstein's Pearl Onion. Although he's taken a shine to Marcia,
too, Mike is the weak, silent type, and here's where it all gets,
well, a little slimy. Mike's weakness isn't vodka or cocaine, fast
cars or easy money. It's frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, frogs. When he eyeballs a mangled pile of amphibious
roadkill during a moonlit stroll with Marcia, Mike's studied aplomb
deserts him, and he's on that squashed frog like a man on a date
with his dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The distracted Marcia, played by a deliciously seductive Erin
Quinn Purcell, doesn't notice at first what Mike (the inspired
Gregory Jackson) is up to. But when she pivots and takes in the
sight of Jackson squatting and chowing down minced frog, it's a
delirious moment, an example of comedy of the gross-out variety,
yet carried off with a beguiling urbanity and style.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of comic impertinence at which the Adobe
Theater Company excels, and which bubbles forth with effervescent
glee in ``Duet!,'' the downtown troupe's offbeat lampoon of the
American way of mating.
</P>
<P>
   The show, written by ackson and Ms. Purcell, who directed it
with help from Jeremy Dobrish, Adobe's artistic director, is a
delightful sendup of that wholesome staple, the boy-meets-girl
story, and at the same time a bewitching spoof of the tacky
Hollywood and Broadway values that over they years have made that
story such a wonderfully easy target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duet!,'' subtitled ``A Romantic Fable,'' was a major success
for Adobe last season, in a short run at the Ohio Theater in SoHo,
and now the production has been remounted at the Actors' Playhouse
in the West Village for an open-ended run.
</P>
<P>
   The little troupe, which gained a following among young
audiences with its smart, low-rent conceits and disarming,
spectator-friendly innovations _ like rolling onto the stage a
pay-what-you-can bar before and after performances _ took a big
risk with this show; it accepted the backing of a major Broadway
producer, Dodger Endemol Productions, whose current ventures
include such far-from-downtown spectaculars as ``Titanic'' and
``Footloose.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, though: no fancy-schmancy triple-decker sets have
been added. The Dodgers, as they are known, have not tampered with
a winning formula, and so ``Duet!'' has lost none of the
seat-of-the-pants feel that made it such a gem on Wooster Street.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it looks more down-market than it did before, which
is not on the whole a great thing: the Actors' Playhouse is a
strange little theater on Seventh Avenue, with low ceilings and a
vaguely unwelcoming ambiance, which the Adobe people seek to combat
with beaming ushers who thank you for coming and all but seem
poised, like flight attendant trainees, to load you down with
blankets and pillows.
</P>
<P>
   This eagerness to please is part and parcel of the company's
charm. What sets Adobe apart is its ability to harness the youthful
esprit, the comradely elan, of college theater and buff it to a
more professional gloss. Thus ``Duet!'' gets away with silly bits
so purposefully sophomoric they make you laugh in spite of
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pearl Onion, for instance, when a tap-dancing candy girl,
played as a ditzy second banana with terrific timing by Kathryn
Langwell, breaks into a version of ``Anything Goes'' in Cantonese,
there's a funny subtext. This surely is a production in which
anything is meant to go.
</P>
<P>
   The straitlaced, rubber-faced Jackson, who takes a page from
Steve Martin's comic book, and the voluptuous Ms. Purcell,
platinum-blonded-up to resemble a latter-day Marilyn, lead the
merry ensemble through a fractured version of an overwrought stock
story, the girl who falls for the guy with the terrible secret.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins with an encounter of the Kismet variety at the
Pearl Onion: Marcia falls in love the moment Mike begins to sing,
ever so eerily, a song that gives the barest hint of an unhealthy
self-involvement, ``My Echo, My Shadow and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From there, ``Duet!'' spins wittily and nattily from one
vignette to the next, parodying the conventions of the dating game.
Naive Marcia invites Mike to meet her parents, who are as bizarre
as they come. Dad (Frank Ensenberger) is a catatonic dropped in
front of a television set; Mom (Derin Basden) is a dipsomaniac who
gets way too comfortable with her daughter's beau.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hilarious re-creation of a roller-coaster ride,
accomplished with a couch, a horizontal bar and a few synchronized
jerks of the body, and a terrific mime show of a
sweet-as-cotton-candy date, accompanied by insipidly jaunty movie
intermission music.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia's bliss is short-lived thanks to Mike's distasteful
culinary habits. Whether it's wearing unironed shirts or feasting
on swampy entrails, men really are savages, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   As much as it's intended to poke fun at modern romance,
``Duet!'' supplies a funny, running commentary on modern
entertainment. Beginning with the sleazy hamminess of the Pearl
Onion, presided over by the oily Noam Pearlstein (Henry Caplan)
doing his abysmal magic tricks, the production plays continually
with our collective show-biz sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma''-style dream sequences, burlesque comics, B-movie
melodramatics and even the Muppets come in for some delectable
ribbing; an exotic dancer in a leopard-spotted bikini (Beau Ruland)
gyrates cheekily with phallic snakes and spears in a pre-show
warm-up act. And it's all treated so good-naturedly that the comedy
never comes across as harsh or jaded.
</P>
<P>
   While the designer Steven Capone does admirable work with a
minimal set _ his retractable translucent moon is lovely, and the
hoot owl that terrifies Marcia is a clever surprise _ a few of the
production's incidental elements have not transferred as well.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan looks a little too callow as the buffoonish lounge maven,
and the play's final scene, involving the visitation of a host of
plagues and disasters, is both dimly lighted and badly staged. But
with a company this droll, you're quick to forgive the lapses.
What's a shot or two off the mark when so much of the evening is
on? &QL;

<P>
   The American public, if opinion polls are to be believed, would
like the Lewinsky affair to be forgiven. Some of Bill Clinton's
supporters would have liked him to have resigned, in order to hand
power smoothly to Al Gore and to bring the Clinton presidency to an
honorable close.
</P>
<P>
   Given that he hasn't, they think it would be wrong for Congress
to impeach him, as they consider his crimes and misdemeanors to
have been low ones rather than the high sort demanded by the
Constitution as grounds for such a punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign leaders have queued up to express their astonishment
that America is spending its time arguing about sex, lies and
videotape while the world economy spirals earthward.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives
voted this week to recommend that an impeachment inquiry be
launched, and the full House has voted to accept that
recommendation, with support from quite a few Democrats as well as
the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Might the public, and the supporters, and the foreign leaders be
correct? Surely Congress, particularly its Republican majority, is
going too far?
</P>
<P>
   To take that view is to misunderstand what President Clinton has
done and, as so often, to let sex blur the issue and cloud the
mind. With so much known about the salacious details of a sad
relationship, it has come to seem as if the issue is whether a
president is entitled to some privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On this view, his affair was ``inappropriate,'' as he has
admitted, but so are many affairs. His judgment was poor, but so is
that of many brilliant and otherwise resolute men when it comes to
matters of love and lust. He lied, in public and in sworn
testimony, but he did so as a man trapped by right-wing enemies and
intrusive prosecutors, desperate to protect his privacy and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   If you are satisfied with that account, you may think that
impeachment is an absurdly disproportionate punishment. But before
examining whether that account is in fact adequate, one awkward
point also needs to be kept in mind. Even on this sympathetic
account, Clinton has broken the law -- a law he swore to uphold
when taking the oath of office at his two inaugurations.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the very least, he needs somehow to be punished.
Otherwise, a signal will be sent to every American that some sorts
of law-breaking are acceptable, or that there is one standard for
the high and mighty and another for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, under the Constitution, for Congress to
mete out that punishment it needs first to hold an inquiry. Having
done that, it could well, as ex-President Gerald Ford suggested
this week, deliver Clinton a rebuke rather than impeaching him and
removing him from office. Such a compromise may even be Clinton's
own hope. But to get to that point, a proper and open process has
to be gone through.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, it would be best if that process were short. But to
understand why even that cannot be guaranteed, as well as why an
inquiry is justified for other reasons, it is worth questioning
whether the sympathetic account of Clinton's conduct is really as
adequate as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this account becomes plain when you move beyond
what happened to consider how it happened. None of it -- the
affair, the lies, the alleged obstruction of justice, the two sets
of sworn testimony by Clinton -- happened quickly, as if with a
rush of blood to the head. It all happened slowly, which implies
that most, perhaps all, of his actions were calculated. The
testimony was well planned. He knew well in advance that Monica
Lewinsky was becoming embroiled in the Paula Jones case. There was
time to think, to discuss alternative courses extensively with
advisers, to find jobs for her.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sex sounds as if it was carefully calculated. All in
all, this does not feel simply like a story of foolish decisions by
a cornered, passionate man.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, after hearings, Congress will decide that that is
indeed the motif of this story. But the reason why Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, was originally appointed was the suspicion
of a pattern of obstructive and evasive behavior; and Clinton's
behavior when the Lewinsky affair merged with the Paula Jones case
did, on the face of it, fit that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the suspicion endures that such behavior may also have
manifested itself in matters other than sex -- matters that even
his sympathizers might consider more serious. It is that, combined
with the Lewinsky evidence, which offers ample cause for an
impeachment inquiry, one with a chance of flushing out evidence of
other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will end with an impeachment, let alone removal
from office (a separate action, by vote of the Senate) it is too
early to say. The constitution is vague enough to support a view
that his crime is too low for an impeachment -- or that by
betraying his trust and breaking his oath of office Clinton has
done more than enough to deserve to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the adopted cliche of congressmen of both parties, it is
right to ``take a deep breath'' and begin the inquiry. The only
irresponsible action would be to stop now.

PGA Tour card. Four times, he tried qualifying school. Four times,
he failed.

leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gary McCord, the CBS golf live wire and ``Tin Cup'' star, never
won on the PGA Tour. He turned 50 in May and has a sponsor's
exemption at the Transamerica to generate ticket sales on a weekend
when the tour's top trio _ Hale Irwin, Gil Morgan and Larry Nelson
_ are absent.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, Morgan and Nelson represent that category of player most
likely to succeed on the Senior Tour _ the former PGA Tour star.
There'll be a few of those entered in the Transamerica _ youngest
among them John Mahaffey, who notched 10 PGA Tour victories before
he turned 50 on May 9; winningest among them Gene Littler, 68, who
won 29 PGA tournaments from 1954 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Another category of players with promising horoscopes comprises
those who played on tours around the world. Some of them at the
Transamerica include Hugh Baiocchi (South Africa), Peter Oosterhuis
(Europe), Jose Maria Canizares (Europe) and Kurt Cox (Asia).
</P>
<P>
   But of the top 31 money leaders last year _ and 31 is a magic
number out here, where the top 31 gain full exemptions into the
tournaments of the subsequent season _ nine of them had made
livings in places like the insurance business (Jay Sigel) and the
auto assembly line (Tom Wargo).
</P>
<P>
   One of the top 31 so far this year is Hall, who comes to
Silverado looking for nothing more than his first victory. He
earned a conditional exemption with his 11th-place finish at
Q-school last year and looks like a lock for the full exemption
this year, with $609,153 and a ranking of 20th, between Wargo and
Ray Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had regained his amateur standing after those ill-fated
attempts to go pro 30 years ago, and in 1985 he won the Carolinas
Mid-Amateur. Five years ago, he decided to prepare for the Senior
Tour and enlisted a sponsorship group of 13 that ensured he would
never have to sleep in his car after he turned pro again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He also enlisted the support of his wife, Carol, and daughter,
Holly, which didn't keep him from getting homesick during two years
of play on the Asian Tour and another (1996) on the Hooters Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The travel has been the hardest thing,'' Hall said. ``But it's
worked out great. Holly is in her fourth year in college now, and
my wife is able to travel with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wanted to draw a road map ... it's turned out
sweet.''

`HOLY MAN' MAKES A COMIC SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - You're watching one of those home shopping stations
and you've already bought the food storage system and the cubic
zirconian dinette set and the young-forever mystery goop. What's
left to buy? How about a little enlightenment to complete the
package?
</P>
<P>
   You don't expect to find spirituality on junk-for-sale TV, but
that's what you get in ``Holy Man,'' a cute comedy which asks the
question: can you have a higher state of consciousness and non-stop
shopping at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Goldblum stars as Ricky, the hustling head of an
infomercial network who is about to lose his job for committing the
only sin in the salesman's bible: flat sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky needs a savior. He finds one literally in the mysterious G
(Eddie Murphy), a kind of wandering, zen, comic mystic.
</P>
<P>
   In a last ditch attempt to save his job, Ricky puts G on the
air. But instead of selling beauty aids and chain saws, G talks to
America about how unimportant all that material stuff is compared
to true inner peace.
</P>
<P>
   And the sales start rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   The more G tells people they don't need junk, the more junk they
buy because he alleviates their guilt over wasting their time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   As the zen pitchman becomes American's favorite guru, Ricky has
to face his own truth: will he sell his soul for success?
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Man'' is a fun movie without being outrageously funny.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Herek (``101 Dalmatians'') puts together a
smart comic match, then twists it. Murphy's high-energy antics,
which served him so well in ``The Nutty Professor,'' should blend
hilariously with Goldblum's dead-pan drolleries.
</P>
<P>
   But the director and writer Tom Schulman (``What About Bob?'')
make a strange decision: they mellow out Murphy's mania and put
Goldblum in the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   They get away with it because the set up is funny enough. But
they don't take full advantage of the talents of their two stars.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy needs to dazzle. He plays extraordinary characters like a
comic genius. But he doesn't play ordinary straight men nearly as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Goldblum is a better comic counterpuncher. He shines when he
reacts to the star with acerbic one-liners, but you don't want him
carrying the plot and the comedy. That's why he was funnier in
``Jurassic Park'' than in ``Holy Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Holy Man'' has too much Goldblum and not enough
Murphy, it's still an amusing, enjoyable light comedy with a few
hilarious infomercial spoofs.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``Holy Man'' contains nothing objectionable for
9/10ths of the movie. Then they drop in a couple of mild
profanities for no reason at all. I get the feeling that Hollywood
producers and the movie ratings board aren't even aware any more of
what much of America considers to be profanities. 3 stars. &QL;

SPYING OUT THE JOB MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ If you have ``superior intellectual ability,
toughness of mind and a high degree of personality,'' there's a job
waiting for you, particularly if you speak Farsi or other difficult
languages.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few drawbacks: You can't talk about your work
outside the office. In many cases, you can't even reveal where you
work. And, by the way, you might have to take the occasional
lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new CIA recruiting drive, launched last month by
the spy agency, which has been suffring in the tight job market.
After enduring years of staff shrinkage from cuts and brain drain,
the CIA is scouring college campuses for well-educated officers and
even offering signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Large ads in The Economist and other publications promise ``the
ultimate international career,'' filled with ``fast-moving,
ambiguous, and unstructured situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clandestine Service Trainee Program, for example, needs
people who can place moles in foreign governments and exploit the
criminal underworld. As the ad phrases it, ``Operations Officers
spearhead our intelligence collection efforts and are actively
involved in seeking new sources of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's Directorate of Operations, which oversees
clandestine work, plans to increase the number of its officers by
30 percent in the next seven years, according to spokesman Mark
Mansfield. He won't say how many new hires this involves, because
the directorate's current roster is secret.
</P>
<P>
   They also need employees to monitor terrorism, weapons
proliferation, the drug trade, and states such as North Korea and
Iraq. ``Some people have the mistaken impression that the agency
had a loss of mission in the wake of the Cold War, but nothing
oculd be further from the truth,'' Mansfield said. ``The mission
has grown more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to beef up the agency started under former director John
Deutch and have expanded under George Tenet, the current CIA
director. In a speech to agency employees in August, Tenet promised
a recruitment program ``that parallels the very best in private
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has long advertised for employees, but this campaign is
notable for its hard sell, due in part to the way the agency's
image has been tarnished by scandals over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting ad features the words integrity, intellect, and
common sense, written over a photo of a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed. Photocopies of the ads have drawn
laughs among former CIA employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC-hood has struck home, even at the agency,'' concluded a
former CIA officer with the pseudonym Edward G. Shirley. ``The use
of a smiling 21-year-old black women as being a typical agency
recruit is new, and that's simply a reflection of the institution's
desire to appear `with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the agency will not say whether the woman is
black or white, and it is not clear from the ad. Nor would
Mansfield disclose the name of the agency that designed the ad. He
did say that the CIA is making a special effort to recruit women
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is about time, said Richard Shultz, an &UR;  &LR; international
security expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University. Shultz was part of a group of academics and
retired intelligence officers who in the 1980s wrote a report
urging the CIA to improve its recruiting and diversify its
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   After obsessing for years about everything Soviet, the agency is
now more active in Asia, Africa, and the Mideast, ``where, to be
sort of blunt about it, white guys don't fit in,'' said Shultz &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said the agency must compete vigorously with
investment banks and consulting companies that seek the same
employee profile: personable, multilingual, computer-literate,
willing to live abroad. The CIA is particularly interested in
engineers, biochemists, economists, and people fluent in Farsi,
Arabic, and the languages of the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mansfield, college recruiters, ads, and the
agency's Web site generate more than 100,000 inquiries and 30,000
resumes from job seekers every year. The agency has streamlined its
hiring so that background checks that used to take six months can
now be done in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of headhunters out there ready to pounce on
strong candidates,'' Tenet said in a speech in August. ``To delay
is to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency &UR;  &LR; has decided to focus on just 60 colleges that have
proven records with the CIA or substantial numbers of minorities &UR; . &LR; 
They include Harvard, MIT, and Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also trying to overcome misperceptions that have
hampered it in the past. For example, someone who experimented with
drugs years ago is not automatically disqualified as an applicant
today. ``We look at how recent and frequent the drug use was,''
Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of the agency has suffered from the cases of
Aldrich Ames and Harold Nicholson, both convicted double agents who
spied for Moscow, said Abram Shulsky, a former staff member of the
Senate Intelligence Committee and author of ``Silent Warfare,'' a
book about intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough has come out like the Ames case that has made the
agency look unattractive,'' Shulsky said. During the Cold War,
recruiting was easier because ``part of the attraction was that you
belonged to a really elite institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the agency has lost its luster, it has had trouble recruiting
on the Ivy League campuses that used to provide a steady stream of
new officers, Shulsky said. ``In a sense, they're sort of forced
out to the more open job market.''

ART NOTES: DE KOONING INVASION; ARCHER LOVES WARHOL; MOTHERWELL
MECCA; NEW NAME AT THE MET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The work of Abstract Expressionist painters is all
over Manhattan this fall. Last month the Whitney Museum of American
Art opened its Mark Rothko retrospective, and on Nov. 1 the Museum
of Modern Art will present its Jackson Pollock show. Now Willem de
Kooning is getting all kinds of attention too.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Tuesday, two of his monumental bronze sculptures,
``Standing Figure'' (1969-84) and ``Reclining Figure'' (1969-82),
will be shown at the Doris C. Freedman Plaza at the East 60th
Street entrance to Central Park and in Bryant Park. The sculptures
are from the artist's estate; their installation was organized by
the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit institution that presents
contemporary art in public places.
</P>
<P>
   Other de Kooning exhibitions will each be devoted to a different
part of his career. Matthew Marks and Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the
dealers handling work from the artist's estate, have organized a
two-part exhibition, ``Willem de Kooning: Drawings and Sculpture,''
which will be in Marks' Chelsea gallery at 523 W. 24th St. and in
Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash, Ms. Mitchell-Innes' gallery at 1018 Madison
Ave. The double show, from Oct. 31 through Dec. 19, will have 80
drawings and 10 or more sculptures, most of them small, made
between 1960, when the artist moved to East Hampton, and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the drawings were studies, which de Kooning kept for
himself,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening on Oct. 31 is ``Drawing Seeing/Seeing Drawing,'' at
the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster St., in SoHo. Organized by Klaus
Kertess, an independent curator, it will include 70 works and will
focus on four groups of drawings created between 1958 and 1970. The
show will travel to the Addison Gallery in Andover, Mass., then to
the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Each show has its own personality. The Drawing Center show
includes works borrowed from private collections and museums. None
is for sale. The gallery shows will present works from the estate;
all are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The three de Kooning shows follow the exhibition of his work at
the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1994 and the show of
works from the 1980s at the Museum of Modern Art two years ago. Now
many de Kooning fans are waiting for a full-scale retrospective of
the artist's drawings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   For Fun and Profit
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Archer's name is commonly associated with Britain's
Conservative Party and with his best-selling thrillers, not with
the art world. Yet for seven years Lord Archer has been an avid
collector, primarily of Warhols.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went mad and started buying all over the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, Archer estimated, he had 42 paintings and 285
prints by Warhol as well as 83 signed David Hockney prints dating
from 1954-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put together groups of 10s,'' he said, referring to his
Warhol prints. Warhol would frequently make his prints in
portfolios of 10, and Archer has tried to assemble complete
portfolios of such iconic Warhol images as flowers and soup cans.
</P>
<P>
   But like a Wall Street speculator, as fast as Archer buys, he
sells. On Oct. 20, about 60 works will go on view at the Peter
Gwyther Gallery, a new gallery on Bruton Street in London. Prices
will range from $1,000 to ``very high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer isn't hoping to cash in just on recent rising Warhol
prices; he's also a partner in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at London auction houses said they were familiar with
Archer's collection. While no one was willing to speak for
attribution, some experts said Archer had approached them about
auctioning his works at Sotheby's or Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not true,'' he said. ``But I did talk to them about a
charity auction.''
</P>
<P>
   Only some of Archer's Warhols and Hockneys will be offered this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning to keep my favorites,'' he said. ``I'm tempted to
hold on to the 10 Campbell's Soup cans and the black Marilyns. I've
gotten very attached to them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Motherwell Lode
</P>
<P>
   The Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto is fast becoming a mecca
for Robert Motherwell's works on paper. This month the museum
acquired 74 works: 69 on paper, four paintings and a collage.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous trustee gave the museum the money to buy the works,
which are said by experts to be worth $1.5 million. They came from
the Dedalus Foundation, the Manhattan-based organization
established after the Abstract Expressionist's death in 1991 to
distribute works from his estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that Motherwell was a central figure in 20th-century
art who was especially influential in Canada,'' said Matthew
Teitelbaum, director of the museum, adding that the foundation
approached the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase consists of almost half a century of the artist's
drawings and is the most complete archive of the artist's works on
paper. Among the highlights are works from the artist's signature
series, ``Elegies,'' dating from 1949 through 1977, and a group
from 1942-47 that show the artist's early interest in Surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is planning several Motherwell exhibitions with its
new holdings, Teitelbaum said. In a year it plans to mount a show
of drawings by Motherwell, de Kooning and the English artist
Patrick Heron. It will deal with how artists return to drawing when
they get older.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard Changes
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Barnet, who for eight years was the associate
curator of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Detroit
Institute of Arts, has recently become the Michel David-Weill
Curator in charge of the Metropolitan Museum's department of
medieval art and the Cloisters. He succeeds William Wixom, who
retired in August after 19 years at the museum.

AT THE MOVIES: `LITTLE VOICE'; DEMI MOORE; CHUCKY GETS LUCKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Mari Hoff is quite disagreeable, with an overheated
sexual appetite, an appallingly salty tongue and an over-the-hill
figure. Ray Say, her boyfriend in this working class English town,
isn't much better: he books strippers at a local club and cruises
the streets in a hulking, red Oldsmobile convertible. And then
there's L.V., for Little Voice, Mari's grown-up but waiflike
daughter, who is so crushed by her mother's demands and the death
of her father that she has retreated to her bedroom to stew, squeak
out an occasional word and sing the show tunes her father loved,
like a diva.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarkable ability to belt out the songs of performers like
Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey becomes the instrument for
discovering the wounded humanity in this unlikely bunch in ``Little
Voice,'' which is to open in December.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the movie is reminiscent of ``Brassed Off,'' the tale
of how a brass band formed by a group of miners in England brought
some solace to their otherwise grim lives.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no coincidence, since both were written and directed by
Mark Herman, who is staking a claim as the man who finds magic in
even the meanest circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty evil bunch, really, this lot,'' said Herman in a
telephone interview. ``They're pretty greedy, especially at the
end. Ray is pretty revolting. But there is redemption for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie stars Jane Horrocks (Bubble in the British television
show ``Absolutely Fabulous'') as the silver-throated L.V., Brenda
Blethyn as Mari and Michael Caine as Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Herman has brought his signature touches to the movie, but it
was something of an accident that he has made it at all. The film
is based on a play by Jim Cartwright, ``The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice.'' Herman said he went to the play on opening night in London
only because he had friends performing. ``I usually hate the
theater, but I was knocked out by this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was propitious because, he said, he was struggling
with what to do after the success of ``Brassed Off.'' Herman said
he had had just a few months to produce the script. The movie,
which was filmed in the northern England seaside town of
Scarborough, was shot in nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he insisted that he was faithful to the play's spirit,
Herman took license in several respects. For one, he came up with
the idea that Bill (Ewan McGregor), the young man who is courting
L.V., would have an interest in homing pigeons, with the roost on a
hilltop overlooking the town an excuse to get the characters, and
the camera, out of Mari's house.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he brought a fairy tale quality to the
end, with the characters finding something positive in catastrophe,
not just horror.
</P>
<P>
   And then, Herman added, the actors brought new things to the
movie, never more evident than in a scene in which Ray is trying to
lure L.V. to do a nightclub act with the tale of a bluebird finding
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable because we had to shoot that on the wrong
day and so people weren't able to prepare,'' Herman said. ``But
Michael was so pleased. He did these seven-minute takes just like
that. He just knew. The performances were better than I had
envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's Who?
</P>
<P>
   Marie is a widow and a literary critic who lives in the south of
France with her two children and dreams of an alter ego, Marty, a
New York literary agent who is unwilling to get attached to a man.
They both fall in love. Or is Marty the one dreaming of Marie to
express her unfulfilled longings?
</P>
<P>
   Both characters are played by Demi Moore, in ``Passion of
Mind,'' her first movie in two years and that rare film, a thriller
of the mind. Filming has just begun in New York and will move
shortly to France.
</P>
<P>
   The script was written by Ron Bass, who also wrote the recently
released ``What Dreams May Come.'' But the choice of Alain Berliner
as director underscores the nature of the film as an inner journey.
Berliner is a Belgian whose last film, ``Ma Vie en Rose,'' about a
boy who believes he is really a girl, won a Golden Globe award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like `Ma Vie en Rose,' we must decide which life to
choose eventually,'' Berliner said. ``It's a choice we all have to
make someday, dreams or reality. In this movie, she ends up
choosing, and you understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's like a puzzle of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the striking qualities of the movie is that though it
deliberately blurs dreams and reality, it is written in a very
straightforward, almost austerely realistic manner. Stellan
Skarsgard, who plays Marie's French lover, said this approach was
underscored by the unusual quality of the dialogue, adding that the
heart of the movie was in the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is really written for actors, with dialogue that's
kind of different,'' said Skarsgard, who talked over a cellular
phone while arguing with a taxi driver in his native Stockholm.
``There's no small talk with my character. His dialogue is written
in a very condensed way. He's so frank, so straightforward about
everything. I'll see if I have the courage to play it completely
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Skarsgard, who played the math professor in ``Good Will
Hunting'' and more recently was a spy in ``Ronin,'' said that was
why the part was so challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something ambiguous about the characters I
play,'' he said. ``I always try to look for something good as well
as bad. My character is a good guy, but I can't see making it all
black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Skarsgard said he did not want to reveal too much about the
plot, except to say, ``You should wonder until the last page what
is dream and what is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Berliner emphasized that the point was not to create a fanciful
fiction, but a story that, hopefully, the audience will truly
relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own life, I had to choose between dreams and reality,''
he said. ``Where am I? I'm in reality right now.''

horror. Chucky, of course, was the nightmarish, supernatural serial
killer who slashed his way through ``Child's Play'' in 1988 and in
a sequel before petering out with ``Child's Play 3'' in 1991. It
seemed the world had had enough of a malevolent doll possessed by a
murderer's soul.
</P>
<P>
   But never underestimate the Lazarus-like powers of malevolent
dolls. Chucky is back, sort of, in a spiffed-up 1998 version. Now
he's got a girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly), a sex drive and a sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bride of Chucky,'' to be released Oct. 16, is a sign of the
times. It has been produced by the same cast of characters who
developed the original franchise, but this time they have delivered
a sendup in an effort to tap into the revived interest in the
horror genre by an irreverent and hip new generation that has taken
to wisecracking films like ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The title alone kind of makes you smile,'' said David
Kirschner (above), a producer. ``And you get lines like, `Chucky
gets lucky.' Every 18-year-old can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Basically what we said was, yes, there's horror,
yes, Chucky's frightening, but he's funny now. It's kind of a
psychotic muppet movie.'' As it happens, Kirschner began his career
as an illustrator for Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets.
</P>
<P>
   You know this is not the old doll when Tiffany, his girlfriend,
tries to conjure his dismembered parts back to life by reciting
incantations from a book, ``Voodoo for Dummies.'' She may be a
murderer herself, but she is not without a touch of class; her hero
is Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Chucky and Tiffany have a troubled relationship, not helped when
her soul migrates into a doll, too. But they do have moments of
bliss, doing what dirty-minded dolls do with their clothes off.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was written by the creator of the franchise, Don
Mancini, but a new director, Ronny Yu, was brought in from Hong
Kong. Yu recently directed ``The Bride With White Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Kirschner said, the producers worked
hard to insure the movie had an R rating, as did the previous
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have an R rating you're going to lose your 16-,
17- and 18-year-old crowd,'' he said. ``They want to see the
excitement and the chases and the kill. That's what the rating
signifies.''

ART REVIEW: DAZZLING AND DEVOUT VOODOO ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 1990s have been watershed years for art. Building
on the multicultural thinking of the previous decade, traditional
esthetic categories and hierarchies have been radically revised;
cultural geographies have been remapped.
</P>
<P>
   The very phrase ``20th-century art'' now evokes a global
phenomenon, far larger and more complex than yesterday's bankable
Picasso-to-Pollock model. ``Contemporary art'' describes work
produced in New Delhi, Beijing, Dakar, Seoul, Istanbul, Havana and
countless points in between, with activities in midtown and
downtown Manhattan factored somewhere in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   This shift in perspective has yet to make a notable impact on
some big-league American institutions, but it has had a huge effect
on smaller museums and in academia. With the blurring of lines
between art and ethnology, fine art and craft, religious and
secular, ``major'' and ``minor,'' cultures that were once barely
noticed are being studied, documented and exhibited. In the
process, treasures are being revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Just such treasures can be found in ``Sacred Arts of Haitian
Vodou,'' a traveling exhibition that originated at the Fowler
Museum of Cultural History, at the University of California at Los
Angeles, and opens Saturday at the American Museum of Natural
History in Manhattan, the last stop on a two-year tour.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which has appeared in fine art and ethnological
museums, is a product of an intellectually expansive time. Its
curators, Donald Cosentino, a professor of African and Caribbean
folklore at UCLA, and Marilyn Houlberg, a professor of art and
anthropology at the Art Institute of Chicago, are a savvy
cross-disciplinary team. Their splendid catalog _ a genuine page
turner _ gives equal time to historians, sociologists, artists and
religious practitioners, with fascinating results.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the art that counts, and the objects included here,
some 500 in all, are spellbinding. They range from vivid painted
narratives to shimmering beaded flags, from plaster Madonnas to
immense carved wooden drums. In these works, African, European and
indigenous New World influences weave together to produce intense
visceral excitement and disquieting beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The impression that results, one of sheer material abundance
packed with significant detail, could easily be overwhelming. But
the exhibition has been expertly shaped to introduce its subject
gradually, at a step-by-step pace that still has a cumulative pull.
</P>
<P>
   The first gallery is devoted to secular material and sets the
stage. Here, Haiti's stirring, turbulent history is illustrated
through bold narrative paintings, most by contemporary Haitian
artists, some commissioned for the show.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with the Spanish colonization of Hispaniola,
the island now divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
followed by the arrival of French and English buccaneers. The
native Taino population was killed off; slaves were brought from
Africa to work the cotton and coffee plantations. The religion
called Vodou, or Voodoo, grew from transplanted West and Central
Africa beliefs that mingled with elements of Roman Catholicism.
(Vodou is the Creole spelling of an African word for spirit.)
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo proved to be a powerful social binder for a slave
population that, in 1791, rose in armed rebellion against its
owners and 11 years later created the world's first black republic.
Then after a period of calm, a pattern of political turmoil set in,
culminating in the long rule (1957-86) of the infamous Duvalier
family, which is represented in the exhibition by a mesmerizing
shocker of a group portrait by the painter Edouard Duval-Carrie.
</P>
<P>
   Through everything, including ``anti-superstition campaigns''
conducted by church and state, Voodoo flourished. And the final
painting in the opening gallery suggests why. The picture, by the
Haitian-born New York artist Fritz St. Jean, is of paradise, which
in Voodoo belief exists under the sea, or on the other side of the
mirror, or in a mythical Africa, and is a promised, perfected
version of the natural world. That's the way it looks here: a
delirium of tropical exuberance, with flowers blooming, friends
meeting and flamingos ferrying passengers through the sky.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the installation offers a symbolic sea change in
the form of a mirrored archway through which one passes into the
rest of the show, leaving the secular world and entering the sacred
realm of Voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately one is welcomed by a receiving line of the
religion's chief divinities embodied in various symbolic forms. As
personalities, they are a difficult, mercurial lot:
trouble-shooters and troublemakers, comedians and tragedians,
terrifying parents who are also doting uncles and aunts.
</P>
<P>
   Some are temperamentally aligned with a cool, sweet aspect of
Voodoo known as Rada; others with its hot side, called Petwo/Kongo.
A few figures slip between both camps, as the mood takes them. And
they are each represented by objects in which their individual
energies are distilled.
</P>
<P>
   The serpent deity Danbala, for example, is embodied in several
forms. He is there in the glinting image of snakes stitched in
sequins on a temple flag; in a commercial print of St. Patrick,
shown shooing the snakes from Ireland; in the figure of a charming
ancien regime gentleman painted in a hollowed-out calabash by the
Haitian artist Andre Pierre, and finally in a linear cosmogram
called a veve, drawn in pencil in a priest's notebook but destined
to appear on a temple floor.
</P>
<P>
   The other gods are accompanied by customized versions of similar
objects, along with telling accessories. The goddess of love, Ezili
Freda, a creature of extravagant airs and graces and prone to fits
of weeping, is supplied with a consoling bottle of her favorite
perfume. Her cousin and rival, the irritable Petwo deity Ezili
Danto, is represented by a print of a brooding, dark-skinned
Madonna. The nasty scratches that scar her cheek are proof of her
willingness to go hand-to-hand with anyone who crosses her, or to
protect those who seek her aid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Devotees, in their turn, must cajole the gods with offerings,
examples of which are on display. Some consist of rum bottles
sheathed in fabric and studded with gems. Others are bowls or vases
wrapped in ribbons like Christmas gifts, with feathers or
crucifixes protruding from the top. Still others, adapted from
African prototypes, are cloth bundles stuffed with earth and
healing herbs, and bound so tightly with string that they look as
if they might explode at a touch.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of physical and psychic tension they radiate relaxes
in the next section of the show, a dark corridor lined with rows of
temple flags. These are probably the most familiar of all Voodoo
objects, and they are enchanting, combining the graphic clarity of
African applique banners with the scintillating luxuriance of
Christian liturgical vestments.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few precious turn-of-the-century examples are
included here, most are fairly recent; little surviving Voodoo art
can be reliably dated before the 1940s. Some of the flags are made
by artists recognized as masters of the medium. Among them is
Antoine Oleyant (1955-92), whose distinctive style is seen in a
cubistic image of the god Danbala, dressed in a checked shirt and
holding a rooster and a tiny Haitian flag on high as his signature
serpent floats around him like a windblown scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Oleyant produced flags for rituals and the commercial market,
and he is surrounded here by other outstanding artists in whose
work the sacred and secular meet. Hector Hyppolite (1894-1948),
extolled by Andre Breton in the 1940's, is one, and in paintings
like his ``Magique Noire,'' Voodoo images and modernist painterly
flair meet.
</P>
<P>
   Most arresting, though, are the assemblages of Pierrot Barra and
his wife, Marie Cassaise, created from castoff objects _ machine
parts, dishes, broken tools, holy pictures, dismembered dolls _
swaddled in bandagelike layers of plastic and satin. The results
are emblematic of post-modernism's assimilative spirit and powerful
works of religious art. Barra's life-size figure of the goddess
Ezili Danto, her body encrusted with sequins, dolls sprouting from
her hair, is a nightmare of organic growth and suffocated energy,
at once resplendent and dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   The blend of beauty and danger this image conveys, the sense
that dynamic forces are at work, is characteristic of Voodoo art.
And it is dramatically evident in the three full-scale altars with
which the show concludes, particularly the one dedicated to the
gods known as Gede, who preside over death, sexuality and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The piled-up images _ miniature coffins, a skull wearing a top
hat, a cross wrapped in slaves' chains _ represent the forbidding
night side of a religion. But they are also evidence of its vivid,
life-affirming theatricality. Here spiritual experience is
orchestrated as a mystery play, and art effects a psychological
trial from which the participant emerges shaken but renewed.
</P>
<P>
   How, if at all, can such a dynamic be conveyed in a museum? The
question is still in debate after more than a decade of hard
thinking. One can imagine a visitor to the American Museum of
Natural History perceiving with skepticism, even dismay, ritual
reduced to the status of a curiosity. But other reactions are
equally possible, as other, similar exhibitions have confirmed.
When the Museum for African Art mounted its landmark ``Face of the
Gods'' in New York five years ago, the Afro-Caribbean altars in the
galleries created in the galleries attracted ardent and persistent
religious devotion throughout the run of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Post-modern thinking in the 1990s has, to its credit, cleared
the way for both views to coexist, with their attendant limitations
and revelations. And it is thanks to that embracing atmosphere that
the art of Haitian Voodoo _ culturally eclectic, materially
ephemeral, contemporary and traditional, sacred and profane _ can
be seen at last, and seen as the magnificent spiritual tour de
force that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou'' opens Saturday at the American
Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, and
remains on view through Jan. 3. The show is a collaboration between
the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles; and the
national museums and Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and
UCLA's African Studies Center and Center for African-American
Studies. The presentation at the American Museum of Natural History
is supported by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Endowment Fund.

DISNEY PLANS ESPN SPORTS BAR IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walt Disney and its subsidiary, the cable sports
network ESPN, announced plans Wednesday to open an upscale sports
bar called ESPN Zone in Times Square next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The 42,000-square-foot restaurant and bar at the northeast
corner of 42nd Street and Broadway would enlarge Disney's already
considerable presence in Times Square, which includes a store and a
theater. For ESPN, which has an Internet site and recently began a
magazine, the move represents another effort to make its brand name
more visible and diversified.
</P>
<P>
   The first ESPN Zone opened in Baltimore this summer and has been
used by ABC, also owned by Disney, for its Monday Night Football
halftime show. But according to Disney officials, the Times Square
location will become the flagship, and the enterprise could become
a chain. ESPN and ABC expect to do live broadcasts from the New
York restaurant, they said, using customers as part of their studio
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The ground floor will house Studio Grill, where patrons can eat
$8 hamburgers and $20 steaks while sitting in replicas of the sets
ESPN uses for Sportscenter, NBA2Night and Baseball Tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, discriminating couch potatoes will be able to select
from a variety of televised games on one of 13 immense screens
while ensconced in leather reclining chairs with speakers in the
headrests. The top floor will have a variety of sports-related
games.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Disney said they were not concerned about opening
so close to the Official All-Star Cafe, a sports-themed chain with
a location at 45th Street and Broadway.

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: VINTAGE PRINTS NOT ALWAYS SUPERIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For anyone interested in exploring the pros and cons
of vintage prints _ those made within a few years after a negative
is created _ exhibitions of work by Ansel Adams, Brett Weston and
Gordon Parks, now at three Manhattan galleries, make intriguing,
sometimes contradictory arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ansel Adams: Vintage Prints,'' at Alan Klotz/Photocollect,
includes prints made in the 1920s through the '50s and makes a
persuasive case that these early prints are better than many
soaring landscapes that Adams mass-produced in the late 1970s and
early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of the select f/64 group, so named because
they set their lenses to that aperture to get the near and the far
equally sharp, Adams made contact prints from large negatives to
maintain even greater clarity. The early prints are therefore small
(roughly 7 by 9 inches), but the largeness of his vision is more
evident in them than in many of his bigger, later ones.
</P>
<P>
   Adams could turn a simple patch of ground into a bewitching bed
of wondrously delicate wildflowers, as he did in ``Trailside, Near
Juneau, Alaska'' (circa 1948). And ``Nevada Falls,'' circa 1928, is
alive, tactile, with many shades of gray between the brilliant
white and glistening black. Certain photographic papers before the
1960s had high levels of cadmium and silver, which, photographers
say, allowed for warm tones and a wide range of grays.
</P>
<P>
   But vintage prints are not all equal. To one side of ``Nevada
Falls'' is ``Rushing Water, Merced River,'' which looks colder,
flatter and thinner. Next to it is ``Water and Foam,'' which was
printed the same year as ``Rushing Water'' but is fuller and
richer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the grouping of trees and mountains are Adams' self-styled
Parmelian prints of the '20s, which have a distinctive creamy tone
and parchment-like texture. ``Sierra Juniper,'' in particular, is a
standout, the pencil-thin lines down the tree trunk marvelously at
odds with the sheer massiveness of the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the shortcomings in many later prints is the
prominently displayed 1950s print of a 1932 image, ``Pine Cone and
Eucalyptus Leaves, San Francisco.'' The print is amazingly flat and
lifeless, as though Adams were incapable of tonal subtleties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brett Weston: Vintage Photographs,'' at the Edwynn Houk
Gallery, spans the period from 1929 through the early '70s and
includes many images that have not been previously exhibited. It
generally shows this artist, who was overshadowed by his famous
father, Edward, at his best. But here, too, the vintage prints are
not uniformly great.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Brett Weston's early prints have a subtle warmth and an
ardent attention to detail: paw-print-like marks on cracked earth,
almost three-dimensional floaters on the water's surface, ridges on
sand dunes that are gently registered as far as the eye can see and
even where the eye normally can't, in deep shadow. ``Forest,
Netherlands'' (circa 1971) would have been an unremarkable close-up
of tree trunks if not for the tree trunk in the middle of the frame
that, positioned just so, looks as though it were solarized.
</P>
<P>
   Weston can make peeling paint sing, which he did in ``Cracked
Paint, Garrapata, California'' (1954). In ``Lily Leaf'' (1930), he
compared the close-up of a lily stem and leaf to the full curves of
a luscious fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the prints he made in the '70s and '80s are harsh
and lifeless; a 1973 ``Mendenhall Glacier,'' for sale at an auction
house this week, resembled an alien landscape with crumpled metal
for mountains and inky black for water. At the gallery, ``Highway
North of Santa Fe, New Mexico'' is a 1938 vintage print, but it
feels like a later print; it's cold, and the boldly black road
cutting across the image is jarring.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, a later print of ``Car Window, Deluxe
U.S. Company, San Francisco,'' in the gallery's office, is almost
indistinguishable from the 1936 vintage version in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vintage Gordon Parks: 50 Years in Black and White,'' at the
Howard Greenberg Gallery, together with ``Half Past Autumn,'' a
Parks retrospective at the Museum of the City of New York, makes
the strongest argument that the work of certain artists is best
seen in their vintage prints.
</P>
<P>
   At the gallery, one gets used to shadows yielding more details,
to a gorgeous delicacy, to crisp details and a full range of tonal
grays, to the photographer's nuanced, warm engagement with his
subject.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the later prints, at the museum, are of generally
poorer quality. The flaws are highlighted because clearly better
prints _ warm, detailed, nuanced _ are shown next to prints of
images from the same period that are coarse, lacking many details
and overwhelmed by a dominant muddy black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Place de la Concorde, Paris'' is so deficient _ harsh sky,
weakly defined background buildings and foreground cars,
rain-slicked roads a dull black _ that a reproduction of this image
in a 1948 issue of Life magazine, placed nearby, can intimate a
crisply magical wet evening in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' 1950 photographs of street beggars in Portugal are
heartbreakingly tender. A print at the gallery of a beggar girl
holding a baby who is peeking curiously at the photographer matches
the photographer's empathy with an understated, gently detailed
esthetic. The print of the same image at the museum is coarser. And
a beatific ``Beggar Woman and Child, Estoril, Portugal'' is so
reduced to dull black, grays and white that one craves a vintage
version.
</P>
<P>
   Some attribute the coarser qualities of modern prints to
photographic papers that have lower silver content and, for
environmental reasons, no longer have cadmium, a heavy metal. But
many photographers working in black and white manage to tease
incredible tonalities out of existing papers, of which there
remains a good range.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is more likely a dichotomy in the way a
photograph is viewed: as art or as a representation of an image or
idea.
</P>
<P>
   For Parks, Greenberg said, photography was for reproduction; it
was never about photography as art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The print was not the issue,'' Greenberg said. ``The negative
is the issue, and he's always guarded his negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Parks' black-and-white prints have been made at the
Time-Life photo lab, and although he has no difficulty exhibiting
and selling the modern prints, the question raised by ``Vintage
Gordon Parks'' remains. If viewers have seen prints at their best,
what purpose does it serve to reproduce prints that are a shadow of
what they can be?
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a mistake to equate vintage with superior. And an
emphasis on age and, more recently, provenance can result in a
myopic obsession with the photograph as ``object.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the notion of vintage prints encourages the kind of
close attention to what is in front of us that is only for the
good. Because it is only by really looking that a later print might
end up being judged superior to an early one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ansel Adams: Vintage Prints'' remains at Alan
Klotz/Photocollect, 22 E. 72nd St., through Oct. 24; ``Vintage
Gordon Parks: 50 Years in Black and White'' at the Howard Greenberg
Gallery, 120 Wooster St., through Oct. 24, and ``Brett Weston:
Vintage Photographs'' at the Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Ave.,
through Nov. 7.

BRIEF REVIEWS OF SOME NEW MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   ``ANTZ,'' starring the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone,
Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman and many others. Directed by Eric
Darnell and Tim Johnson (PG, 83 minutes). Computer animation has
advanced to the point where it can make a cute romantic couple out
of Allen and Ms. Stone.
</P>
<P>
   This and other surreal tricks are shown off in a funny,
ingeniously animated insect picture that often reaches the
anthropomorphic cleverness of ``Toy Story'' and shows off Allen's
sharpest comic timing with one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Antz'' winds up overplotted in bizarrely grandiose ways,
with the threat of genocide invoked for a jarring change of pace.
Must every child-friendly adventure film, even one with
considerable potential to delight grown-ups, boil down to a
struggle for world domination? Surely a threat of bug spray in the
picnic basket would have done the trick (Janet Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE GOVERNESS,'' starring Minnie Driver and Tom
Wilkinson. Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is
the early 1840s, and Rosina (Ms. Driver), a headstrong young
Sephardic Jewish woman living in London, poses as a Gentile to get
a job as a governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish
island. Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head
of the household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom
she has a stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the
invention of photography.
</P>
<P>
   The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels: as a
proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and its
relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Stephen Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LOLITA,'' starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain.
Directed by Adrian Lyne (R, 137 minutes). At last, Lyne's fine,
deeply felt adaptation of Nabokov's diabolical masterpiece can be
seen in the large-screen format it truly deserves. Why go out?
Because the detail and texture of this lavishly produced film shine
theatrically in ways that weren't possible on Showtime, and because
the film's mostly unalloyed subtlety (except in its opening and
closing sections) rewards a closer view.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne's direction is the best work of his career. Irons' splendid
performance conveys a tragicomic blend of ardor and conscience,
while Ms. Swain plays the title role as a startlingly unpredictable
adult-child hybrid. For a culture so dangerously obsessed with
youth and beauty, this haunting ``Lolita'' is a fascinating sign of
its times (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,'' starring Hope Davis and Alan
Gelfant. Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms.
Davis), an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (
Gelfant), a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously
meant for her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily
ever after?
</P>
<P>
   The set-up of this romantic comedy about dating in the 90s may
seem cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited film
refreshes the genre with the acuteness of Anderson's observations
about people and middle-class urban life in general.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis creates a wonderfully complex portrait of an
idealistic introvert coping with loneliness, disappointment and
pressures from all sides, including (in the movie's funniest
scenes) some ardently self-centered suitors who answer a personal
ad. A rich Brazilian bossa-nova score gives the movie the mood of
bittersweet longing (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ONE TRUE THING,'' starring Meryl Streep, Renee
Zellweger and William Hurt. Directed by Carl Franklin (PG-13, 120
minutes). This film adaptation of the novel by Anna Quindlen _ a
former columnist for The New York Times _ about an ambitious New
York journalist forced to move back in with her parents to care for
her dying mother strikes a sad and universal chord.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Streep and Ms. Zellweger are beautifully matched as a
mother and daughter who achieve a grown-up understanding during
this anguished time. But the movie treads the line between soap
opera and serious drama and has far too many cute and sentimental
touches.
</P>
<P>
   Its structure _ the story is told in flashbacks that make the
mother's death a kind of whodunit (she dies from an overdose of
morphine) _ also cheapen the movie without ruining it (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``PECKER,'' starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Martha
Plimpton and Lili Taylor. Directed by John Waters (R, 87 minutes).
Waters, the Trash King of Baltimore, does his best to puncture New
York art-world pretensions in a film whose biggest joke is its
title, though plenty of winking smaller jokes are here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flavor of Month Causes Tizzy in Art World'' reads a headline
summarizing the career of the title character, a Baltimore
shutterbug who just won't quit snapping friends and neighbors. In
the film, fame and fortune threaten Pecker's trashy esthetic and
gross-out chic. Waters' own style hasn't had to sacrifice these at
all (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``PERMANENT MIDNIGHT,'' starring Ben Stiller and
Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by David Veloz (R, 85 minutes). As Jerry
Stahl recounts in his 1995 memoir, drug addiction turned him into a
skittish, distracted, hugely self-involved individual. Since he
happened to be working as a television writer in Hollywood, no one
really noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The film version of his story plunges fearlessly into the
self-inflicted humiliations that went with this story. In a
first-rate, rivetingly caustic performance, Stiller plays a man on
a fashionably decadent slide all the way to rock bottom. The
character's clearest sign of dysfunction is his inability to
appreciate Elizabeth Hurley as his ravishing, high-powered wife
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``RONIN,'' starring Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan
Skarsgaard, Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by John
Frankenheimer (R, 121 minutes). Directing like a world-weary
Hitchcock with a taste for the breathless car chase, Frankenheimer
propels this tale of intrigue through its tightly plotted paces so
expertly that he even makes an action hero of De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   European in both its brooding tone and beautiful French
settings, this story of double-dealing mercenaries in pursuit of a
metal suitcase features a tough, expert cast and some sensational
action sequences. Frankenheimer directs them in fast, efficient,
no-frills fashion because no extra frills are needed (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``ROUNDERS,'' starring Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich
and John Turturro. Directed by John Dahl (R, 120 minutes). Though
this tale of poker fever finally adds up to less than meets the
eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Martin Scorsese's brand of irresistible lowlife and
aided by a splendid rogues' gallery of a cast, the director of
``The Last Seduction'' takes his audience into a poker demimonde of
abundant color. As the actors make the most of rascally roles
(Malkovich has a field day with a Russian accent), the story leads
to settings as varied as the Elks Hall in Binghamton and a Russian
Turkish bath. Dahl may not have new thoughts on the gambler's life,
but he makes this guided tour worth the trip (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon,
Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg.
Directed by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Turning back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the
genre, he works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war
as if it had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes
are frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller
who made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the
closet has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest
of the casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES,'' starring Leelee Sobieski,
Kris Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey and Anthony Roth Costanzo.
Directed by James Ivory (R, 120 minutes). Working without a classic
at hand, the Merchant-Ivory team adapts a novel by Kaylie Jones,
James Jones' daughter, into a colorful panorama weakened by
autobiographical sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   With no real narrative shapeliness and a loosely anecdotal pace,
it vividly recalls the coming of age of a sensitive young woman who
(though well played by 14-year-old Ms. Sobieski) remains a more
slender, peripheral figure than the film's ambitions require.
Moving from Paris to America, it succeeds more at evoking detail
and atmosphere than in finding the heart of her story (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,'' starring Cameron Diaz,
Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly
(R, 119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a cruel, cruel zipper, this
paean to low humor works ridiculously well because it never stoops
to being mean-spirited or (despite all appearances) authentically
inane. The principal cast is bright and appealing, with Ms. Diaz at
her most beautiful and blithe.
</P>
<P>
   Do note that this film strives hard for something to offend
everyone, and that a tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is
unfortunately required (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT DREAMS MAY COME,'' starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding
Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Directed by Vincent Ward (R, 106
minutes). If the gothic-romantic special effects in this turgid pop
fable set in the afterlife are some of the trippiest ever devised
for a serious drama, this sudsy fantasy about married soul mates
who meet after death never comes emotionally alive.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is at his fake-sincere worst as the world's most
devoted husband who dies in a car crash and goes to heaven. Ms.
Sciorra is simply blank as the wife who commits suicide and must be
rescued from hell. Gooding, glaringly miscast, plays Williams'
angelic guide (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``WITHOUT LIMITS,'' starring Billy Crudup, Donald
Sutherland and Monica Potter. Directed by Robert Towne (PG-13, 118
minutes). In telling the story of the mercurial track star Steve
Prefontaine, a screenwriter known for enriching screenplays with
unruly, unpredictable life creates a surprisingly resonant
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Crudup's charismatic performance as a runner with the
attitudes of a rock star, this can be watched as one more sports
film, complete with exciting race sequences. But it's not truly
about winning, losing or even playing the game; instead, Towne
considers the philosophical distance between the brash Prefontaine
and his formidable coach, Bill Bowerman (expertly played by
Sutherland). The film's wisdom lies in its thoughtful way of
balancing these two (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,'' starring Jason Patric, Ben
Stiller, Aaron Eckhardt, Catherine Keener, Amy Brenneman and
Nastassja Kinski. Written and directed by Neil LaBute (R, 100
minutes). Three men obsessed with one another's sexual performance
are at the core of this second film from the director of ``In the
Company of Men.''
</P>
<P>
   The new movie is so blunt at times, and so unrelievedly talky
and dark at others, that it cries out for the velvet glove of
``Manhattan,'' a much more seductive film about sexual opportunism
and urbane cruelty. Yet even when LaBute's material feels mannered
or unremittingly sour, it sustains a psychic ferocity that commands
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The intricate web of lies, failures and brutal revelations here
is strong stuff, and it's the work of an original filmmaker who
takes no prisoners (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   ``G.W. PABST.'' In the midst of a comprehensive retrospective of
23 of the surviving 30 films of the celebrated director G.W. Pabst
(1885-1967), the Museum of Modern Art is offering a particular
treat for filmgoers Friday night at 6 and 8 p.m. It consists of a
screening of two Pabst films, ``Pandora's Box'' (1928) and ``Diary
of a Lost Girl'' (1929), each starring Louise Brooks, the
entrancing American actress whose artistry was most fully realized
not in Hollywood but in the films she made for Pabst in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pandora's Box,'' Brooks plays the amoral Lulu, created by
Frank Wedekind, who inspired ``Lulu,'' the Alban Berg opera. In
``Diary of a Lost Girl,'' Pabst's last silent film, Brooks plays a
pregnant girl who escapes to a brothel after her parents exile her
to a reform school.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the museum will show six Pabst films beginning Friday.
Continuing through Oct. 31, the series at the museum, 11 West 53rd
Street, Manhattan, is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults;
$6.50 for students and those 65 or older; free for visitors under
16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30
to 8:30 p.m. Screening information: (212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van
Gelder).

 &HT;    MINISTERS SAY MANY BLACKS WANT CLINTON TO STEP DOWN
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three black ministers called Thursday for President
Clinton's resignation, saying the public is mistaken in believing
all African Americans support the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black people that I talk to in churches across this nation
are deeply disappointed in the behavior of the president ...and
many want him to resign,'' said Bishop Earl Jackson Sr. of Exodus
Faith Ministries of Boston and president of the Samaritan Project,
a former branch of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, however, feel that if they dare to voice their
reservations about Mr. Clinton, they will be attacked by the
liberal thought police,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The minister's statements came as the House voted to open an
impeachment inquiry against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in 1992, Clinton has generally won raves from
the African American community for appointing several blacks to
prominent positions. Throughout the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
African Americans have continued to back the president, public
opinion polls show.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jackson argued that what Clinton has done is
``manipulate the black community with emotionalism and symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said while ministers forgive Clinton for his actions in
the White House, the president should still resign because he is a
bad role model for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appointment of a few black cabinet officials or a highly
visible visit to Africa does not change the life of one black child
in America,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Melvin Johnson, a pastor at Heart of Christ Community
Church in Brazoria, Texas and Bishop John Witherspoon of the Holy
Spirit Full Gospel Ministry in Milwaukee offered letters of support
for Jackson's position.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers said they hoped their statements would encourage
other conservative blacks to voice their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community is divided along lots of lines,'' Witherspoon
said at Thursday's press conference. ``A lot of ministers have
mixed emotions. A lot of people are in love with Bill Clinton and
don't want to speak out.''

   FILM-WITHOUT LIMITS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Without Limits'' chronicles an aspect of American
life we don't often see in the movies _ the quality of earned
arrogance. Steve Prefontaine, as played by Billy Crudup, has a
brand of spiritual superiority that manifests itself as a physical
arrogance _ his proud walk, which shows off his supreme belief in
himself. As the premier U.S. long-distance runner of the early
1970s, Pre, as he's called, believes the world is his oyster _ his

   FILM-ONE TOUGH COP &QL;
</P>

   UNDATED _ For some reason, cop movies lend themselves to some of
the most generic titles in cinema. We've already had, in large
black block letters on white backgrounds, ``Cop,'' ``Cop &AMP; 1/2,''
``Cops and Robbers'' and ``One Good Cop.'' Now ``One Tough Cop''
joins them on the shelf. Eventually, Meryl Streep will star in
``One True Cop,'' and we can all be done with it. You might think
that a bad title doesn't necessarily mean a bad movie. In the case
of ``One Tough Cop,'' you would be wrong. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story

<P>
   UNDATED _ Every city has one, intones the poster for ``Monument
Ave.,'' the new film starring Denis Leary. I'm not sure about that,
but I know that every aisle of Blockbuster has one _ a gritty,
low-budget film about a band of small-time hoods trying to keep it
together, their days dissolving into a mixture of alcohol, drugs,
fights and woman-chasing. Directed by Ted Demme, ``Monument'' at
least takes advantage of its Boston location. The tiny, cramped
streets, with the brick row houses, give it a look unlike any
other. Boston is also the home of the Irish hoods who pounce from
one meaningless petty crime to another _ ``Ladz in the Hood.'' By

   FILM-HOLY MAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Holy Man,'' in which Eddie Murphy plays a
mischievous mystic who performs miracles for a home-shopping
network, is one of those movies that's kinda fun until you start
thinking about it. Unfortunately, its overlength gives you plenty
of time to do just that _ to think about things, such as the way
the movie has (very) vague echoes of 1976's classic ``Network.''

has been caught up in an office romance. Romantic encounters at the
office, in fact, are at an all-time high, which may explain why
some Americans aren't shocked by Clinton's actions. With the huge
increase in women in the work force, the increasing time spent at
the office and a loosening of relationship rules in corporate
America, office affairs now number in the millions, attorney Dennis
M. Powers says. He discusses the trend, plus its implications,
especially in respect to sexual harassment laws, in his book ``The

HENRI MATISSE SCULPTURE: SIDELINE ILLUMINATES MATISSE'S MAIN LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though he is celebrated as one of the 20th century's
great painters, Henri Matisse (1869-1954) was also a sculptor of no
small talent. True, he turned out vastly more paintings than
sculptures, once declaring to an interviewer that for him sculpture
was ``a break from painting.'' And with a few exceptions, the
bronzes he made were small. But despite his statement that he made
sculpture ``as a painter,'' some of Matisse's works in this medium
rank among the 20th century's greatest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is plenty of play back and forth between his work
in these two mediums. ``I took up sculpture because what interested
me in painting was a clarification of my ideas,'' he said. ``It was
done for the purpose of organization, to put order into my feelings
and to find a style to suit me. When I found it in sculpture, it
helped me in my painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he tackled the same subjects in both, it was inevitable
that one medium should feed the other. In his vast volume on
Matisse (1984), the French art critic Pierre Schneider surmises
that the artist was intrigued by the materiality of sculpture, the
depth, volume and weight that he could not find in painting.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample evidence of his mastery in ``Henri Matisse:
Sculpture'' at C&AMP;M Arts, touted by the gallery as the most complete
exhibition of Matisse sculptures in New York since the Museum of
Modern Art's survey in 1972. On view are 26 bronzes and a plaster
cast, more than a third of his entire sculptural output. The show
covers work done from 1900 to 1930, although Matisse continued
making sculpture until 1949, when he turned to the large-scale
cutouts of his last years.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest bronze here is a Rodinesque figure called ``The
Serf'' (1900-03). A half-human-size representation of a man, arms
cut off and head humbly bowed, ``The Serf'' takes its heavily
modeled surface and even its forms from Rodin. (In fact, it is
clear throughout the show that although Matisse disparaged Rodin's
work, his own owes a great deal to it.) The figure echoes that of
``Male Model,'' a Cezannesque painting that Matisse did around the
same time. The salient contrast between the sculpture and the
painting is that in the canvas, color, perspective and other
painterly devices establish a force between the figure and its
background. The sculpture, a solid presence with weight and mass,
cannot rely on these painterly tricks but must hold its own in real
space.
</P>
<P>
   As a thoroughgoing modernist, in contrast to Rodin, Matisse
thought of sculpture as self-referential, that is, it should not
express anything but its own substance, an object in space eloquent
only in terms of its materiality. And he saw sculpture as a process
rather than a representation. As pointed out by Jack Flam, the art
critic and historian who wrote the lucid text for the show's
catalog, Matisse made ``The Serf'' the painting's equivalent by his
intensity of modeling, at times deeply gouging the surface of the
sculpture, at others manipulating mass abstractly to create a play
of light and shadow. But whereas Rodin gave his sculptures
underlying anatomical detail and emotional rhetoric, Matisse _
while at times referring to muscle, bone and flesh _ focuses solely
on the physical stuff of the clay.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to the stolid figure of ``The Serf'' is ``La
Serpentine'' (1909), one of Matisse's most innovative sculptures.
It was taken from a photograph of a cushiony nude who stands
frontally with legs crossed as she leans on a studio balustrade. In
``La Serpentine,'' the nude holds the same pose, but she is pared
down to an exaggeratedly skinny, tall plantlike structure with
rubbery arms, big feet and thick lower legs topped by slender
thighs. Her columnar torso is slightly twisted as she rests one
elbow on a pillar.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse liked to compare the body to a tree in that both are
made hostage to the earth by gravity. His figures thus tend to be
bottom heavy. ``La Serpentine,'' with one leg seemingly rooted to
the ground, is no exception. But on the other hand, space moves
freely around and through the figure to give it a light, airy
persona. It connects directly with one of the cavorting celebrants
in his painting of the same period, ``Dance (II)'' (1909-10), where
the figures relate to space in a similar way. Despite its
emaciation, ``La Serpentine'' is charged with sexual energy; it has
been noted that the pillar the figure leans on is phallic.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ``discovery'' of African art among his colleagues in
the early 1900s, it's not surprising that Matisse incorporated it
into his work. African sculpture appealed to him because, he said,
it was based on the material in which it was carved ``according to
invented designs and proportions.'' And its stylized forms helped
free him further from European sculpture of the past, with its
insistence on credible anatomy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``Two Negresses'' (1907-08), for example, he translated a
photograph of two young African women facing each other, each with
an arm around the other's neck, into a blocky, rectilinear
sculpture. The African stylization of the heads, the rounded,
deeply cloven buttocks of one reflected in the separated circular
breasts of the other, echo the work of certain African cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decorative Figure'' (1908), another African-influenced piece,
depicts a woman perched gingerly on a cube, one big, splayed hand
resting on a rock, the other touching her crotch. Her legs and hips
form a series of rhythmical curves. Her sensuous torso, breasts
high, swings slightly out of axis with her legs and her rigidly
vertical head, creating a dynamic compositional tension. If you
look at the back of the sculpture, and with Matisse's work it is
always rewarding to do so, you see that although in facing the
viewer she seems comfortably seated, one of her buttocks is
slipping off the cube, and other dorsal details are deliberately
out of sync with the front. But the figure, playing off straight
and sinuous, rounded and geometric forms, can't be faulted for
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Heads play a major part in this show, particularly the series of
five women's heads made between 1910 and 1913, called the Jeannette
group after the model who posed for the first two. Moving from
near-realism to the stripped-down, almost surreal essence of a
face, they illustrate Matisse's struggle to separate sculpture from
portraiture. In ``Jeannette V'' the face has become a grotesque,
pared of most of its hair, with one bulging eye and the other
simply a socket. Part of its skull seems also to be missing.
Possibly inspired by an African sculpture Matisse owned, its
daringly severe reductiveness forecasts much that was to come in
20th-century sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Two slightly more realistic heads are ``Henriette II'' (1927)
and ``Henriette III'' (1929), both portraying an African woman. The
first is the more interesting: smoothly modeled with exaggeratedly
plump facial contours and thick lips, suggesting Art Deco style, it
reflects the simplified, pared-to-essence drawing mode that became
quintessentially Matissean. As a tour of Matisse's
three-dimensional work, this show is also a vivid essay on
20th-century efforts to move sculpture from an art of the pictorial
to an art of process. It's a wonderful experience.

   RUSH HOUR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brett Ratner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 94 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese detective named Lee (Chan) looks imploringly at a
little girl. ``Will you practice your kicks and eye gouges?'' he
asks. Actually, it's Lee who employs foot and fist to recover his
young friend, the daughter of a diplomat escorting a priceless art
collection to the United States, after she is kidnapped in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On these shores, and in this kind of movie, detectives also need
an incompatible partner to clash with and later grow fond of. That
would be Carter (the falsetto-voiced Tucker), frenetic bad boy of
the LAPD, who somehow survives his big mouth to be of value in
Lee's marshall-arts battles with a standard-issue Hong Kong crime
lord. Now, let's smash some art objects. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE This is a karate comedy, acrobatic and light-hearted.
Yes, kicks, punches and occasional bullets have their effect, but
the violence is hard to take seriously. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Plenty of street jive, with Carter continually making
reference to posteriors _ his and everybody else's. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 They might enjoy some of the silly business (even if
they don't fully understand it), but the film is inappropriate for
small children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10 Parents could deem the film unacceptable on grounds of
violence and general rowdiness. But most children have seen far
worse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP There's no burning reason either to take them to
or keep them away from this movie. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Loni Anderson, Dan Hedaya, Molly
Shannon, Richard Greico &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Fortenberry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 83 minutes  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerking their heads in unison, as is their custom on NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' Ferrell and Kattan portray the very dim
Butabi brothers, who bash about the Los Angeles club scene, plowing
into women on the dance floor and blurting things like, ``Hey, you
guys want to make out or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely candidates for admission at the chic Roxbury, the boys
ride past the gatekeepers on the coattails of Greico, the former
star of ``21 Jump Street,'' who plays himself. Nocturnal adventures
ensue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Useless idiots!'' screams their father (Hedaya), who by day
employs the pair in his fake-flower shop. Dad's on target there,
but given enough wiggle room in a movie scenario, even idiots can
get girls and make good. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A few slapstick swats and pratfalls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX The boys have simulated sex with several women, and there is
constant talk of sex in all its forms (or quite a few of them). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A stream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 No. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 This is a borderline age for this film. Given the sex
and profanity, parents beware. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Not to endorse loose behavior, but there really
is no lasting harm in a film that is intended for teen-agers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANTZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An animated film about ants with the voices of Woody Allen, Dan
Aykroyd, Sharon Stone, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez,
Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken and others &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom Johnson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 83 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not given to heroics but feeling compartmentalized as, in his
words, the middle child in a family of five million, the worker ant
Z (Allen) expresses his newly liberated individuality by leading a
billion of his downtrodden fellows against the evil ant General
Mandible (Hackman).
</P>
<P>
   As chief of the warrior class, the general plans to eliminate
the workers in an effort to upgrade the colony. Read ethnic
cleansing. Z's reluctant fortitude eventually impresses Princess
Bala (Ms. Stone), but he had better get unstuck from that wad of
gum on the bottom of a sneaker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The ant army takes on a horde of termites, leaving a
corpse-strewn battlefield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None per se, but with Allen in top vocal form, mild innuendo
occasionally surfaces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE Mandible talks a good game, but what he intends is
genocide. That warrants discussion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 They'll be intrigued by the animation and the great
massed ranks of ants (which are impressive), but the story is too
involved and the warfare could frighten some young children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 By this age, they should be on board with the story,
but parents should be ready with clarifications of plot and
explanations of Mandible's behavior. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-11 This is a good age for the film, though older children
may have begun to consider themselves too sophisticated for
animated fare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP Most will have moved on.

NEW QUEST LANDS IN MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY OCT. 10)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Four doors, no waiting. That's the new slogan in the
minivan world, where buyers have rebelled against the
right-side-only, sliding-rear-door setup. Now, it's rear doors on
both sides or else.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Quest (also known as Mercury Villager) is coming into the
four-door realm a bit late in the game, more or less the last major
minivan to jump on the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Because, let's face it, all of these minivans have pretty much
settled into the Chrysler model of front-drive, V-6,
seven-or-eight-passenger, cupholder-enhanced vehicles that drive
like cars. Even Honda and Toyota, which attempted their own takes
on the minivan, have come around.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest/Villager has been one of my favorite minivans for
years, mainly for its driveability, especially the carlike
handling. Although in the past it hasn't compared in interior space
with the long-wheelbase Chryslers or Fords, it has provided
seven-passenger seating and a flexible interior that takes
advantage of the space it has.
</P>
<P>
   For '99, the Quest has been restyled and updated, with more
interior space, a more-powerful engine, freshened styling and, of
course, a second sliding door.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Japanese surname, the Quest is largely a U.S.
product, with redesign work performed at Nissan's design studio in
La Jolla, Calif., engineering in Farmington Hills, Mich., and
assembly along with Villagers at a Ford plant in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Though just 4.6 inches longer and 1.2 inches wider, the new
Quest feels more commodious, with improved stowage behind the third
seat. I'm told the interior has been revised, but the test minivan
was a prototype model, and the inside was a mishmash.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Quest felt accommodating, with easy-to-read
gauges and easy-to-use switches and controls, lots of stowage,
including a handy cargo net strung between the front seats, and, of
course, plenty of cupholders strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   A removable shelf, the better to load grocery bags and provide
two-shelf efficiency, has been added behind the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite feature of this van, and its predecessor, is the way
the rear seat slides forward on rails. With four people aboard, we
stopped off at a furniture store and bought one of those Laz-Z-Boy
reclining chairs. When it came time to load, I was able to fold the
rear seat and slide it forward, providing space for the chair
without disturbing the passengers in the middle row.
</P>
<P>
   The two captain's chairs in the middle row can be removed and
the third seat can slide up to substitute as a three-across middle
seat, providing a large cargo area in the rear. Or one can fold the
middle seat and slide it all the way up to the front seats for the
maximum amount of cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Quest has the same fault of all minivans in providing
inadequate stowage when all seats are occupied. A trip with seven
people onboard requires other accommodations for luggage. Maybe a
roof rack.
</P>
<P>
   The engine has been upgraded for '99, growing to 3.3 liters and
providing noticeably more power. The Quest is still not a
powerhouse among minivans, with the Ford Windstar, Chevy Venture
and some Chrysler models offering more pull. But the Quest will
accelerate, climb hills and cruise at highway speeds without
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is quiet and refined, with scant wind or road noise,
even in this prototype. Like the former model, the Quest will
corner and handle better than most.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Quest rests on the same platform as the old
Quest (the extra length is behind the rear wheels), the suspension
has been revised for a smoother ride. The tester was a
performance-tuned SE version with a rear anti-roll bar and bigger
wheels and tires.
</P>
<P>
   Though pricing wasn't firmed up at press time, base Quests are
expected to start at about $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new styling is more of a makeover than a face lift, with a
new face up front and the extra length nicely added to the original
design. I found the styling of the original to be a little more
edgy, the new one blander and more generic.
</P>
<P>
   Because Honda just unveiled its new Odyssey minivan, and
Toyota's Sierra is new for '99, the new Quest has serious
competition from the East as well as the West.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole run of today's minivans shares the same big-guppy
stying, wedgy in the front and rounded in the rear. They're all
variations on a theme, and choosing one over the other depends
mostly on personal preference or brand loyalty. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for business owners and a defeat for
songwriters, Congress has approved a bill to exempt restaurants and
other small businesses from paying license fees for background
music.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairness in Music Licensing act, sent to President Clinton
late Wednesday for his expected signature, creates exemptions for
restaurants and bars smaller than 3,750 gross square feet and
retail businesses of 2,000 square feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   Larger businesses can also avoid the music fees if they contain
no more than four TV sets or six speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Songwriter groups argued the bill would unjustifiably deny
artists royalties for their songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this music licensing legislation, which seizes the
private property of copyright owners, the United States government
has severely penalized America's songwriters, composers and
publishers,'' said Marilyn Bergman, an Oscar-winning songwriter and
president of the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will our earnings be reduced, but so will the
creative incentive for future generations of songwriters,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the small businesses had argued that they
should not have to pay fees for copyrighted music played on the
radio and TV in their places of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we have been working for a level playing field
between small businesses and the music licensing monopolies,'' said
Herman Cain, CEO and president of the National Restaurant
Association. ``This effort represents the first time in 22 years
that our copyright laws have been modernized.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing measure was passed as part of the Copyright Term
Extension bill, which will extend the length of U.S. copyrights
from an author's life plus 50
</P>
<P>
   years to 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners also won the right to dispute copyright
infringement claims on a local level rather travel to a court in
New York, as current law requires.

   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for business owners and a defeat for
songwriters, Congress has approved a bill to exempt restaurants and
other small businesses from paying license fees for background
music.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairness in Music Licensing act, sent to President Clinton
late Wednesday for his expected signature, creates exemptions for
restaurants and bars smaller than 3,750 gross square feet and
retail businesses of 2,000 square feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   Larger businesses can also avoid the music fees if they contain
no more than four TV sets or six speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Songwriter groups argued the bill would unjustifiably deny
artists royalties for their songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this music licensing legislation, which seizes the
private property of copyright owners, the United States government
has severely penalized America's songwriters, composers and
publishers,'' said Marilyn Bergman, an Oscar-winning songwriter and
president of the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will our earnings be reduced, but so will the
creative incentive for future generations of songwriters,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the small businesses had argued that they
should not have to pay fees for copyrighted music played on the
radio and TV in their places of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we have been working for a level playing field
between small businesses and the music licensing monopolies,'' said
Herman Cain, CEO and president of the National Restaurant
Association. ``This effort represents the first time in 22 years
that our copyright laws have been modernized.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing measure was passed as part of the Copyright Term
Extension bill, which will extend the length of U.S. copyrights
from an author's life plus 50
</P>
<P>
   years to 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners also won the right to dispute copyright
infringement claims on a local level rather travel to a court in
New York, as current law requires.

   ATLANTA _ Disney Co.'s latest venture into musical theater,
``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' by Tim Rice and Elton
John, opened at the Alliance Theater here on Wednesday night before
a glittery audience that was equal parts native Atlantans and
Disney movers and shakers, including Michael Eisner, the company's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1871 Verdi opera about the conflicted love between
a Nubian slave girl and an Egyptian soldier, the show is Disney's
first from-the-ground-up theatrical venture. Its current Broadway
hits, ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Lion King,'' both
originated as animated films.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of its development, ``Elaborate Lives'' is not as
technically complex as those shows. But it depends upon a huge,
ever-morphing piece of Disney magic, a six-ton pyramid that broke
down about halfway through the evening. Most of Act II was
performed without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four different types of technologies inside it,''
said Peter Schneider, president of Walt Disney Theatrical
Productions. ``There are little parts that break, bolts that don't
fit. But it's not a big deal to us. We're just going to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been trying to do just that in the six weeks of
Atlanta rehearsals and previews, but with mixed success. ``I've
seen it twice now,'' said a theater board member, Jennings Hertz
Jr., ``but I've never seen it when the pyramid worked the whole way
through. The show has great potential, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the extended standing ovations, one before the show
and one after, no one seemed to care much about a piece of
technology rumored to cost nearly as much as the Alliance's entire
annual budget of $10 million. ``This show has done for the Alliance
the same thing the Olympics did for Atlanta,'' said the theater's
chairman, Kenneth Bernhardt. ``It has put us on the national
scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Covering the opening night performance for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, the critic Dan Hulbert wrote, ``If the show
comes nowhere near Disney's `Lion King' in authentic feeling _
well, hardly any musical does.''
</P>
<P>
   The themes of ``Elaborate Lives'' _ enslavement, biracial
romance _ are said to have brought Disney to the Alliance and
specifically to its artistic director, Kenny Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival here nine years ago, Leon has transformed the
Alliance Theater into a sometimes controversial but rarely dull
artistic institution focused on diversity. As the programming has
expanded to include the work of playwrights like Pearl Cleage and
August Wilson, the number of black subscribers has grown to 20
percent from 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This play furthers the mission of our theater,'' Leon said.
``I felt very strongly that I had something to say about it as an
artist.'' He said that he had been involved in the casting in New
York and that his creative input had been welcome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Little else about ``Elaborate Lives'' belongs to the Alliance,
other than the box-office receipts from its sold-out run here
through Nov. 8. The only Atlantans in the 28-member cast are three
children in the ensemble, and virtually all the actors are from
Broadway or Off Broadway. Both the director, Robert Jess Roth, and
the writer of the book, Linda Woolverton, are ``Beauty and the
Beast'' alumni, as are the choreographer and the set, costume and
lighting designers.
</P>
<P>
   So other than diversity, why Atlanta? ``Why not?'' said Disney's
Schneider. ``With any show, one tries to find the right artistic
process with which to develop it. With `Lion King' we went to
Minnesota; `Beauty and the Beast' we went to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said: ``The actual physical space of the Alliance is
amazing. It's got a Broadway-size stage and an 800-seat,
intimate-feeling house, so to work out a new musical, that's the
best of all possible worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will say where the show is going from here. There is
still creative work to be done, according to both Rice and Roth,
and the pyramid remains an expensive thorn in Disney's side.
``Chicago is a possibility,'' said Roth.``So is London; so is New
York.''

TAUSCHER JOINS REPUBLICANS IN SUPPORT OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ellen Tauscher was one of 31 Democrats to vote
Thursday for the Republican-sponsored impeachment inquiry into
President Clinton's role in the White House sex scandal and its
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher, who represents a San Francisco suburban swing district
in the East Bay, said her decision ``was based on my conscience and
on my reading of the Constitution.'' The accusations against
Clinton of obstruction of justice, witness tampering and making
false statements require an impeachment investigation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher, who appeared uncharacteristically somber during two
hours of House debate about impeachment procedures, first voted for
a Democratic alternative that would have limited the scope and time
of the inquiry. That alternative failed, 236 to 198, splitting
mostly along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher then supported the Republican measure because, she
said, the alternative would have been no inquiry at all. The GOP
measure authorizing a broad inquiry with no time limits was
approved by a 258-176 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is very important that I can be in a strong
independent position to make sure that Congress handles this in a
fair, due-process oriented way,'' Tauscher said. ``I have more
power to do that if I support the inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was disappointed with the Republican leadership for
limiting debate to two hours before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have had an opportunity for respectful
listening of each other,'' Tauscher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid this is all about the Nov. 3 election, not about
the Constitution and not about the presidency,'' Tauscher said.
``It's about pigeonholing members of Congress, one way or another,
by forcing people to do what they believe is right and abandoning
their colleagues and their party.''
</P>
<P>
   She expressed regret at the sharp partisanship of the debate,
saying she was ``ashamed that we spent today looking like there was
no grace, no comity, no consensus and, basically, encouraging the
partisanship label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't proud of my colleagues and the performance we were
giving. We looked like a house divided, we didn't look like we were
putting the American peoples' best face on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who voted for the Democratic
alternative, said on the House floor that the Republicans were
``inconsistent'' because they elected Rep. Newt Gingrich as speaker
of the House in 1995 after he had been charged with lying under
oath about his political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the double standard, which exults the speaker and moves to
impeach the president?'' Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi sat on the eight-member ethics panel that in 1997 fined
Gingrich, R-Ga., $300,000 for ethics violations. The panel found
that Gingrich committed tax violations in connection with a college
course he taught and also determined he misled the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who chairs the House Democratic
Caucus, said on the floor that Thursday's vote will ``lower the
threshold for which a president can be distracted and harassed from
his constitutional duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said impeachment proceedings should be approached with ``a
deep and abiding respect for the Constitution and the presidency. I
believe the Republican majority has squandered that.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 4.03 inches of rain fell at Paducah, Ky., breaking
the city's record for the date. The upper-level low-pressure system
and associated cold front responsible for the soaking rains across
the Upper Midwest this week will stall near the East Coast Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate rains will douse parts of northern New England as a
surface low-pressure system rippling north along the front draws
Atlantic moisture inland. The heaviest rains will fall across Maine
and the mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire, where the sloping
terrain adds lift to inbound ocean air. But rainfalls will not
match the heavy amounts that fell in the upper Midwest earlier in
the week, given that the richest supply of moisture will likely
stay offshore. Low clouds with light rain or drizzle will wrap
westward into the mountains of New York and northeast Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Fog and low clouds will shroud parts of the Midwest Friday
morning, a product of low-level moisture from rains earlier in the
week. Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms, some with
downpours, will develop near the southern end of the cold front in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers will fall at elevations as low as 5,000 feet in the
northern Cascades of Washington as moist onshore winds are lifted
into a pool of high-altitude cold air. Scattered rain showers will
fall at lower elevations west of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   A warming trend will continue across the Plains from Texas
northward, though patches of clouds will limit Friday's warm-up
across North Dakota and northern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Glacier Overflow
</P>
<P>
   A brimming, glacier-dammed lake continued to overflow into the
Snow River on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula near Anchorage Thursday.
Water began to spill sometime between Sept. 29 and Oct. 1 after
recurrent rain. The Kenai Peninsula lies next to the Gulf of
Alaska, which, as winter approaches, becomes a site of much
storminess. Indeed, the Gulf of Alaska turns into a graveyard for
low-pressure systems from east Asia. Before dying, storms spread
seeds for the development of new storms which feed off natural
temperature contrasts between the tepid northern Pacific and the
nearby Arctic.

EXPLORING NARRAGANSETT BAY'S WESTERN RIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAMELA PETRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We stood at the edge of Wickford Harbor, blinking and sleepy, in
baseball caps, bathing suits and old sneakers. It was 9:15 a.m., a
reasonable hour for a workday, but early for four people on
vacation who had never kayaked before, and were now face to face
with a large body of water, two slips of boats shaped like bananas
and a mellow guide named Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens if we tip over?'' asked my friend Lora.
</P>
<P>
   ``These big double kayaks with rudders almost never tip,'' Craig
responded casually. ``Only one guy's flipped all summer, and that's
because he was too big for the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat reassured, we did our best to absorb Craig's 15 minutes
of dry-land instruction, and gamely set out. Our kayak excursion
was part of a larger quest to explore the western rim of Rhode
Island's Narragansett Bay, particularly North Kingstown and its
epicenter, Wickford Village, and Narragansett, farther down the
coast, where the bay meets the ocean. We were all acquainted with
Rhode Island's summer hot spots like Newport and Block Island, but
wanted to get to know a lower-profile part of the state, whose
genteel blend of cultivated fields, coastal marshes and big Shingle
Style cottages especially beckons in early autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Washington County on the maps, but South County to
Rhode Islanders (call it anything else and you'll get blank
stares), the western side of Narragansett Bay once harbored the
northern equivalents of the grand plantations of the Old South.
Without an urban nucleus like Providence to attract textile and
other industries, South County clung to its rural ways from the
17th to the mid-19th century _ and to its slaves _ anchoring both
on large farms with stone wall-studded fields that rolled down to
the docks of the bay. The legacy of those days is open space and
clean air, fresh vegetables and a handful of historic manor homes
open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   We planned to take in two of the latter, but had decided that
the best place to begin our tour was on the bay itself, which is
how we wound up at the Kayak Center in Wickford. The Kayak Center
is ready to serve any man, woman, child or beast (they routinely
stock life vests for dogs). I read in their brochure about full
moon and stargazing trips, and even a 12-mile, open-ocean
expedition to Block Island. My friends and I, however, had only two
wishes: to see a bit more of Wickford Harbor than the yacht-lined
basin visible from the village and to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes it was pretty clear that we would accomplish
both. Once Marguerite, my kayak companion, and I managed to
synchronize the windmill motions of our paddles, we fell into an
almost Zen-inducing rhythm that was one of the most peaceful (if
shoulder-wearying) means of locomotion I've ever engaged in. Craig
accompanied our two double kayaks in a smaller boat, and in two and
a half hours introduced us to the oyster beds and sea grass
meadows, the quietude of the otherwise lively harbor. Two islands
in the middle, Rabbit and Cornelius, and a puckered shoreline full
of coves and inlets, draped with the fog that drifted in on a thin
breeze, made for a labyrinth of secret places watched over by last
century's beach houses, a handful of fishermen and our kayak
brigade.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of our tour we beached on Rabbit Island for a
quick snack of fruit juice and granola bars before heading back to
shore past Poplar Point Lighthouse and channels of moored boats. I
was crestfallen when we had to climb out of the kayaks; stepping
back on land was like returning to work after a holiday.
Immediately ahead, though, beckoned Wickford Village itself,
essentially a single thoroughfare coming to a T-junction at either
end, with enough shops and galleries and good food to compensate
for breaking the morning's sea spell.
</P>
<P>
   Wickford is like Newport in miniature, shorn of tourist crowds.
Despite some interesting shops like Wickford Antiques Center;
Askham &AMP; Telham, stocked with elegant housewares, and the animal
gift store Pet Peeves, Main Street is more residential than
commercial. Herringbone-brick sidewalks lead past clapboard
facades, beautifully restored and undulating with authentic age and
Greek Revival porticos, to the bay. Also at the end of the street
is a sturdy, 1745 Georgian with a waterfront deck and private
beach, now the John Updike House Bed and Breakfast, which I had
visited on a previous trip.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Street is the real hub of the place, brimming with shops
both trendy and tasteful. A historical marker near the intersection
of Brown and Main denotes the high-water line of the infamous 1938
hurricane (the force of the storm was such that pieces of South
County homes were later found on Rhode Island's eastern shore). We
came upon the marker on the way to Wickford Gourmet. Like the lair
of some great, epicurean beast, it is packed with foodstuffs:
olives in every reptilian shade of black and green, cheeses with
rinds like topographical maps, hand-dipped truffles, pates, hot
sauces, coffees, packaged goods stacked on shelves, hanging from
the ceiling, pyramided on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   We'd opted to stay in Narragansett for the night, about 20
minutes' drive south along Route 1A (also called Boston Neck Road),
but detoured into a bit of history. Just off the road is the
Gilbert Stuart Museum, not exactly a manor house but a circa-1751
snuff mill-cum-homestead next to a flower-ringed mill pond. It's
about as picturesque as New England gets, although its collection
includes none of Stuart's original paintings.
</P>
<P>
   We did learn, however, how to grind snuff, and that Stuart, who
was born there in 1755, was a shrewd businessman _ whenever he was
running short of money, he could knock off one of his famous George
Washington portraits, based on the one that appears on the $1 bill,
in two hours. He made a total of 120 of them. We also learned that
18th-century shoes could be worn on either foot and that the
expression ``off your rocker'' originated with a kind of rocking
bench fitted with a safety bar for infants and a seat for a nanny;
when the child cried the nanny was evidently off her rocker.

`ONE TOUGH COP': SNOOZE, YOU WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some reason, cop movies lend themselves to some of the most
generic titles in cinema. We've already had, in large black block
letters on white backgrounds, ``Cop,'' ``Cop &AMP; 1/2,'' ``Cops and
Robbers'' and ``One Good Cop.'' Now ``One Tough Cop'' joins them on
the shelf. Eventually, Meryl Streep will star in ``One True Cop,''
and we can all be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that a bad title doesn't necessarily mean a bad
movie. In the case of ``One Tough Cop,'' you would be wrong.
Although the movie is based on the autobiography of New York cop Bo
Dietl, its press material includes a note saying that many of the
characters and events have been ``modified.'' That's a relief.
Nobody's life should have THIS many cliches.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's world, Dietl _ whom a doe-eyed Stephen Baldwin
plays as if he'd just been roused from a nice nap in the
hairdresser's chair _ apparently lives a life of stock characters
and hackneyed situations. The boss believes that Dietl's a great
cop, but that he's also a pain in the posterior. Dietl's partner
(Chris Penn) is a lovable lug who drinks and gambles too much
(considering the people he gambles with, his story could be called
``One Dumb Cop).''
</P>
<P>
   Dietl's best friend is a mobster (Mike McGlone) who grew up with
him _ because, don'tcha know, even though they're from the same
neighborhood, they wound up on different sides of the law. That
friendship catches the attention of two FBI agents, who are so
deadpan and robotic that they make Scully and Mulder look like the
guys from ``A Night at the Roxbury.'' One of the agents is played
by Amy Irving, in what may be the worst performance of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Director Bruno Barreto (also Irving's husband), who received an
Oscar nomination for last year's ``Four Days in September,'' takes
himself very seriously. As he did in ``Four Days,'' Barreto
confuses objectivity with dispassion. Even when Dietl and his
partner investigate a savage attack on a nun _ and solve it in less
time than murders are solved on ``Law &AMP; Order'' _ Barreto doesn't
get your blood boiling. He knows how to wield a camera, with some
smooth and fancy crane shots, but the end result is that you feel
like you're watching an episode of ``NYPD Blue'' or ``Homicide''
that doesn't require Dramamine. Or drama, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Days,'' which was much less generic, benefited from an
unusual story and a heartfelt performance by Alan Arkin as a
kidnapped U.S. ambassador to Brazil. Most of the cast of ``One
Tough Cop'' looks like it's joining Baldwin in his slumber party.
Gina Gershon tries to wake the movie up a little bit, as a woman
who comes between Dietl and his gangster friend, but her role is so
underwritten, her screen time amounts to moments between hitting
the snooze button.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie wasn't so full of itself, it would merely be
boring. But its self-importance makes it irritating _ journalists
have even received a ``Get Tough on Crime'' brochure tying its
release to National Crime Prevention Month. Here's a tip: It'd be a
crime to shell out seven bucks on this.

 UNDATED: her rocker. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a short drive to Narragansett Pier, as the town center is
known, where we exchanged the 18th century for the turn of the
20th. In the late 1800s Narragansett rivaled Newport as a watering
hole for wealthy vacationers. But while Newport attracted the
glitterati, with a penchant for balls and imitation chateaux,
Narragansett lured a less ostentatious set, content with seaside
cottages, the inglenooks, verandas and turrets of which were
amassed from the local vernacular into romantic piles of rock and
shingle.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say the Narragansett crowd wasn't above a casino
of its own. In 1888, Stanford White completed one of his Shingle
Style masterpieces on the edge of Narragansett Beach; it burned to
the ground just 12 years later, leaving only two stone towers
linked by a floating arch. These remain today, straddling the coast
road: two evocative, lichen-encrusted memorial markers of a
long-dead building and the Gilded Age that commissioned it.
</P>
<P>
   We drove beneath the ruin, now known as the Towers, en route to
Stone Lea Bed and Breakfast, another building designed by the
legendary firm of McKim, Mead &AMP; White. Stone Lea sits with
authority on an expansive lawn that is the only thing between the
house and the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The house, built in 1883-84, rises like an updraft of wood and
fieldstone into a high, windswept gable, out of which sprout
lighthearted conical dormers and eyebrow windows. The interior
gleams with natural wood paneling and winding staircases. Enormous
bay windows, generously fitted with curving window seats, survey
the sea, while fireplaces and period furniture weave a comfortable
spell of authentic, 19th-century ease.
</P>
<P>
   That night we drove 10 minutes to a venerable Rhode Island
seafood spot called Aunt Carrie's for steamers and corn, and
platters of fried shrimp, scallops, fish and clams. The next
morning we headed back up to North Kingstown to visit Casey Farm.
Like Smith's Castle, a 1678 manor house up the road also open to
visitors, Casey Farm is a genuine northern corn and tobacco
plantation.
</P>
<P>
   We chose to tour Casey Farm, built about 70 years after Smith's
Castle, solely because of its good looks: The house is simply a
large white clapboard box crowned by a seal-gray wood-shingled hip
roof, the sides of which meet at a central peak topped by a
chimney. Sitting squarely in open fields overlooking the bay, Casey
Farm is a strip plantation that extends in a 300-acre swath from
Narragansett Bay inland to the Narrow River. Our guide explained
that walking paths led to both bodies of water, which we were
welcome to follow after our abbreviated glimpse of the house (only
one room is open to the public, as caretakers occupy the rest) and
a tour of the surrounding fields.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Farm still produces vegetables for local townspeople, the
fragrant evidence of which we found drying in the old corn crib:
hundreds of bulbs of ivory-colored garlic, their delicate roots
reminding me of clippings from sparse, curly beards. It was
discomforting to learn that a year or so ago thieves in a
helicopter had stolen Casey Farm's original weather vane (a
reproduction now spins in its place) and, even more so, that there
were once slave shackles in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   We eased our way back to Narragansett on Middlebridge Road,
which follows the brackish and marsh-fringed Narrow River. At a
serene, riverside spot, we found Narrow River Kayaks, another kayak
outfit in a much quieter location, perfect for novices and those
leery of the chop of Wickford Harbor. It is opposite Wiley's at
Middlebridge, a tiny breakfast-and-lunch spot that has a casual
serenity and the illusion that no one else on earth knows it
exists. But we made our way back to Narragansett Pier to the
ultra-cool Crazy Burger, half funky, half clapboard shack, for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Burger is on Boon Street, which, a block to the south,
becomes Gibson Avenue. This is the heart of Narragansett's Historic
District and a haven of turn-of-the-century cottages, several of
which have been converted into exquisite B&AMP;Bs. After a brief tour
through the neighborhood, we opted to stroll along Scarborough
Beach, less than a 10-minute drive south from Narragansett Pier's
own town beach.
</P>
<P>
   On our last evening on the Western Shore, we chose to splurge at
Woody's, a minuscule restaurant tucked into Pier Marketplace. The
Marketplace represents an attempt to apply mid-century ideas about
urban renewal to the seashore: essentially, it's a shingled mall
opposite Narragansett Town Beach and a poor excuse for a village
center. But it does harbor some good shops and restaurants, of
which Woody's is a standout. For dessert we shared a rich, melting
concoction of raspberries in warm mascarpone cheese that came in a
kayak-shaped casserole: the perfect complement to our sea and land
excursions along Narragansett Bay.

MURPHY VEHICLE DERAILED BY HOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Holy Man,'' in which Eddie Murphy plays a mischievous mystic
who performs miracles for a home-shopping network, is one of those
movies that's kinda fun until you start thinking about it.
Unfortunately, its overlength gives you plenty of time to do just
that _ to think about things, such as the way the movie has (very)
vague echoes of 1976's classic ``Network.'' It's ``Home Shopping
Network'' _ the cubic zirconia of media satires.
</P>
<P>
   Which, really, would be OK _ some of the movie's best moments
come in the shots it takes at home-shopping and infomercials, and
at the celebrities who hawk wares on these shows (many of whom show
up in amusing good-sport cameos). Like some sort of
alternative-universe channel-surf, however, it becomes boring and
conventional when it strays away from home shopping to focus on its
main story, another tale of a troubled hotshot who finds his soul.
</P>
<P>
   That hotshot would be one Ricky Hayman, played by Jeff Goldblum
in his typical dry-and-nervous mode (Goldblum may be the only
person in the world who gets the jitters without perspiring).
Accurately dubbed ``Nervous Ricky,'' Hayman is a
home-shopping-network exec whose network is tanking, apparently so
badly that he fears he'll become the best-dressed homeless person
in history. He's so off his game that he can't even get his playboy
smarm to work on Kate (Kelly Preston), the cute and spunky
troubleshooter the network owner brings in to right the sinking
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Murphy as G, a pajama-clad prophet who profoundly affects
Ricky and Kate. You don't have to have seen the movie's ubiquitous
trailers to know that eventually, G will go on the air at the
network and that his anti-materialism message will reverse the
net's misfortunes. He even gets ``prime time'' _ what is that at a
home-shopping network? One in the morning? In the movie's world,
EVERYONE watches home shopping, as if broadcast networks and other
cable channels didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   This may be Murphy's gentlest performance _ G makes Dr. Dolittle
look like Dr. Kevorkian _ and it's oddly off-putting. Despite G's
penchant for practical jokes, Murphy seems not just restrained but
repressed; he's so becalmed here, and looks so different with his
shaved head, that you almost forget that he's Eddie Murphy. Perhaps
this should be a relief after the potty humor that marred ``Dr.
Dolittle'' and ``The Nutty Professor,'' but for some reason, it
doesn't quite work.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the inevitable romance between Goldblum and Preston,
who's charming but also seems restrained, especially after her
blistering performance as Tom Cruise's no-nonsense fiancee in
``Jerry Maguire.'' Like too many movies, this one hits the
relationship button just because it's a way of starting the movie's
third act.
</P>
<P>
   Director Stephen Herek, whose mixed-bag career includes such
guilty pleasures as ``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' but also
such lightweight profit-takers as ``101 Dalmatians,'' simply lets
things ramble on too long. As G engages in his on-air antics _
which we want to see _ Herek switches back too frequently to
reaction shots from the network's control room, which generally
involve someone describing G's actions like a bad play-by-play
announcer. It's distractions like these that detract from the
movie, and make you aware of its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   And of its _ to use an oxymoron _ benevolent hypocrisy. It's
such a good-natured movie that you almost don't notice that G's
anti-materialism message is the opposite of what Hollywood
generally stands for. Leave it to a Disney-owned picture to create
a character who says that the spiritual is more important than the
corporeal, and makes people rich by doing so. Talk about your
profits without honor.

BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN: EQUESTRIAN DREAMS IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BETH UMLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spice and Poison waited patiently for the light as
cars whizzed through the chaotic traffic circle below Brooklyn's
Prospect Park. Spice was a smallish mare, but on her back I was
nearly eye-level with the distant ``Don't Walk'' sign. The light
changed and Walker Blankinship, my instructor and the owner of
Kensington Stables, moved Poison into the street. Spice lagged
behind, and the light changed again before we were across.
Blankinship called over his shoulder, ``Horses have right of way in
New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime city driver, I was not reassured. I wanted Spice
to hustle, but with my first riding lesson just under way, I didn't
know how to tell her. I settled for meaningful eye contact with the
closest driver, and we clip-clopped safely to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, dozens of stables surrounded Prospect Park;
Kensington Stables is the only one that remains. When I first
entered the dimly lighted, crumbling brick barn, I eyed the wooden
bars atop the stalls that were gnawed to half their original
diameter and felt that I'd wandered into a Dickens novel.
</P>
<P>
   But a boombox wired crookedly to the side of a stall was playing
a Haydn concerto, and the horses all looked glossy and well fed.
Alone with 15 snorting, scuffling, thousand-pound nonhumans, I
tried to act casual by patting the nose of a chestnut colt with a
white blaze on his face. He turned his head sharply to look at me
and I jumped a foot, just as Blankinship walked in.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded and spectacled, this 29-year-old Park Slope native is
not your typical cowboy. After strenuously avoiding sports
throughout childhood, he took up riding in college to learn more
about horses for the medieval role-playing game ``Dungeons and
Dragons.'' His knowledge is encyclopedic, encompassing both the
practical and the esoteric. He and his family began running the
stable in 1993 when the building was in danger of being sold and
converted to a warehouse, which would have ended horseback riding
in Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   To select the right horse for me, Blankinship asked about my
riding experience. I had very little, even considering how large
horses had always loomed in my imagination. Growing up in the
Bronx, I devoured every horse book in the library and filled
notebooks with horse drawings. At the age of 14 I went on my first
trail ride. Plodding along a narrow path in a pack of riders, I
tried to let my horse know I recognized its nobility and was worthy
of its trust. It responded by stopping every few yards to graze,
yanking the reins out of my hands. Recently, I resumed my quest for
a soulful connection with a horse and decided to improve my chances
by taking private lessons.
</P>
<P>
   I was nervous as I stood waiting in the street in front of the
stables. When Spice sauntered down the ramp, I was struck by how
big even a small horse looks when you haven't ridden one in 20
years. I had asked to ride Western style, so Spice was decked out
in a big old easy chair of a saddle, curved up in the back with a
horn in front I could grab if I had to. English-style riding, which
uses a smaller, flatter saddle, seemed beyond my reach.
</P>
<P>
   In the movies, mounting a horse signals the beginning of a
chase, a battle, a new life. I was determined to show some panache,
or at least not get stuck halfway up. I stood on Spice's left side,
grabbed the horn with my left hand, stuck my left foot in the
stirrup and swung boldly up, making a mental note to wear looser
jeans next time. Success! I stroked the horse's satiny neck,
breathed in her clean, earthy scent, and my nervousness vanished.
Blankinship turned his graceful, high-strung mare down Caton
Street, and Spice obediently followed. Wearing a black velvet
riding helmet in the rarified air eight feet above the ground, I
felt regal.
</P>
<P>
   The stable is only a stone's throw over the traffic circle from
the south entrance of the park. Once inside, we took the dirt
bridal path to the riding ring. Blankinship used the 10-minute ride
to deliver a lecture on horse psychology. Horses evolved to live in
herds, he said authoritatively, and when you ask a horse to move
about the world on its own you create a state of anxiety that can
easily flare into panic. ``Your job as rider is to reassure your
horse that nothing is about to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the ring, Blankinship had me stand in the stirrups,
bent forward at the hips, to warm up my calf muscles and practice
keeping my legs against the horse's side. I did my best to avoid
pitching forward onto Spice's neck.
</P>
<P>
   The ring was a lopsided circle of stout posts supporting a
flimsy snow fence. I walked Spice around it (or did she walk me?)
for the rest of the hour, practicing basic communication
techniques. Squeeze the legs to move the horse forward. To turn
left, tighten the left rein and squeeze with your left leg. To
stop, pull back on both reins.
</P>
<P>
   But communication occurs on a far more subtle level as well.
Blankinship said a horse ``listens'' to its rider's whole body.
When I had trouble turning Spice, he told me to look where I wanted
to go. ``When you move even just your eyes, you start a chain of
physical adjustments that the horse picks up through its back.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Spice moved immediately in the direction I looked. I
now understood why some people say horses are dumber than dirt and
others say they're smarter than Robert Redford. Horses may not have
rational intelligence but their ability to read body language and
mood is far more evolved than a human's.
</P>
<P>
   As we approached the traffic circle on the way back to the barn,
Blankinship casually mentioned that if my horse spooked and ran, I
should first breathe ``to communicate calm,'' then lean back and
try to steer it in a circle or into brush to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this happen often?'' I asked, flashing back to the
liability waiver I'd signed just after buckling my helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national average is one incident per 350 riding hours,''
he said. He improves the odds by being selective about the horses
he keeps, by putting customers on the right horses, and by keeping
a low ratio of customers to guides.
</P>
<P>
   For the next couple of days I savored a slight stiffness in my
thighs and the slight scent of Spice on my sweater. While the
one-hour lesson could make only the slightest improvement in my
technique, it had provided a compelling introduction to the
intellectual and psychological challenges of riding.
</P>

<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK: Monday night, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (3-1) vs. Jacksonville (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins (2) _ Pass defense ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars (14) _ Pass offense ranking.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: These Florida teams have never met. Now they do so in
prime time Monday night. Expect the Jacksonville crowd to be wild
and a nuisance for the Dolphins' offense _ so will the Jacksonville
defense. Miami's pass defense has improved greatly in large measure
because its pass rush is making great strides. End Jason Taylor
leads there with five sacks. Jacksonville has shown wonderful poise
winning close games on the road but expect its offense to shine in
this matchup. The running of the rookie Fred Taylor starts the
engine. And then Jacksonville will push the pedal to the floor on
Mark Brunell passes, especially to Kennan McCardell, but also
around the field to a variety of nifty receivers. This is the game
where Jacksonville shows the nation why it is a serious Super Bowl
threat. Jaguars, 33-20.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (0-4) vs. Dallas (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Panthers (16) _ Sacks earned.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (59.8) _ Garrett's completion percentage.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Jason Garrett has produced more than could be expected
in absence of the injured Troy Aikman. Garrett has connected on 58
of 97 passes, has a long touchdown pass of 80 yards and has thrown
only 2 interceptions. Carolina signed defensive free agents,
including Kevin Greene, Greg Lloyd and Craig Newsome, and has
nothing to show for it. The Carolina offense turned the ball over
repeatedly last week against . Atlanta, but the defense could do
little about it as the Falcons rolled up 51 points. Dallas won't
score that many _ but more than enough. Cowboys, 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (4-1) vs. New England (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs (69-4) _ ('90s record with 30 carries).
</P>
<P>
   Patriots (32.7) _ Cullors' kickoff return avg.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Chiefs under coach Marty Schottenheimer have long
played good defense. And when the offense run the ball effectively,
that defense gets more rest and is even stronger. A testament is
their impressive record in the `90s when they rush the football at
least 30 times. Schottenheimer is 5-0 against New England, but he
has not recently played this new batch of improved Patriots. His
team will find a faster, stronger crew with the AFC's top kickoff
returner (Derrick Cullors) getting New England started. It is the
New England defense that will take over from there. Watch the
matchups between fleet Terry Glenn against the testy Chiefs
secondary, especially cornerback Dale Carter. Patriots, 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (3-1) vs. Cincinnati (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Steelers (10-2) _ Cowher's record vs. Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals (plus 5) _ Takeaway-giveaway differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Bengals have struggled despite great improvement in
taking care of the football. This used to be a turnover-laden team,
but now Cincinnati is keeping the ball and taking it from offenses.
And still losing. Not enough big or timely plays. Somebody needs to
make a few. Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott, the Bengals' receivers,
are candidates to do that. So is back Corey Dillion. And Neil
O'Donnell (1 interception thrown in 117 passing attempts) should
play well against his former teammates. It is an upset, a
breakthrough game for Cincinnati. Bengals, 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (0-5) vs. Philadelphia (0-5)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Redskins (-11) _ Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (-6) _ Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Here are two teams with big headaches. Nothing is going
right. Neither can sustain drives consistently. Neither can hold on
to the ball. Neither is forcing enough turnovers. Washington,
however, has more offense and should score steadily. Its passing
offense ranks third in the NFC and averages 241.6 yards a game.
Michael Westbrook leads the NFL 460 receiving yards. He will prove
a handful for the Eagles' defense. For Philadelphia, misery
continues. For Washington, a small reprieve. Redskins, 28-17.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (1-3) vs. Indianapolis (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Bills (plus 5) _ Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   Colts (-7) _ Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Can Buffalo possibly be interested and play with
intensity after its huge upset of San Francisco? Was that a
one-game season for the Bills and now they coast? Unlikely with
leaders like Bruce Smith in the locker room. Look for the Bills to
place great pass rushing heat on rookie quarterback Peyton Manning.
Look for Bills running back Antowain Smith to break loose. The home
team has won five of the past seven in this series, but Buffalo has
won five of the past six overall. Buffalo wins it with the pass
rush and the running game. Bills, 24-16.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (1-3) vs. Baltimore (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Oilers (2.9) _ George's average yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens (31.5) _ Lewis' average yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: We know that Ravens receiver Germaine Lewis is a
little, fast guy, but c'mon. He is averaging a ridiculous 31.5
yards per catch. Three passes to Lewis and the field is nearly
covered. What is the problem with Eddie George and the Oilers'
running game? It would seem George could fall over and gain 3 yards
a pop. Lewis and George. Both worth watching. For both the trends
continue and that means a Baltimore victory. Ravens, 17-9.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (3-1) vs. New Orleans (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   49ers (494.0) _ Offensive yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Saints (284.8) _ Offensive yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Steve Young is playing his best football. He is the
first player in league history to pass for 300 yards and three
touchdowns in four consecutive games. With one more 300-yard
passing game, he ties Joe Montana's record of five straight. Young
is showing mobility, a strong arm and wonderful decision making,
despite the 49ers' shocking loss at Buffalo. Garrsion Hearst back
is averaging 5.7 yards a carry. Jerry Rice is two games from
breaking Art Monk's streak of catching at least one pass in 183
consecutive games. New Orleans is the only NFC team that has not
lost a fumble. It will need that kind of mistake-free effort and
then a major boost on defense to keep pace with San Francisco. Not
this time. 49ers, 26-17.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (1-4) vs. Arizona (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Bears (35) _ Rushing first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (9) _ Defensive ranking.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Hooray! Bears win! They beat Detroit last week for
their first victory, with Erik Kramer lifting the passing game. In
his last two starts, Kramer has a 114.3 quarterback rating (647
passing yards, 6 touchdowns, 1 interception). And Curtis Enis is
producing, leading all rookies with 280 rushing yards. But watch
Cardinals back Larry Centers. He leads all backs with 24 catches
for 147 yards. His routes out of the backfield give quarterback
Jake Plumber a safe, short throw that helps produce first downs.
Arizona has 11 takeaways (7 fumble recoveries), and its defense has
improved from 27th last year to 9th now through five games. It will
force turnovers that prove critical in this matchup. Cardinals,
19-13.
</P>
<P>
   Denver (5-0) vs. Seattle (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (8) _ Bubby Brister TD passes.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks (25) _ No. 1 in sacks.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Denver leads the league in points with 182; that is an
average of 36.4 points scored per game. In the last four against
Seattle, it has averaged 32.3 and won them all. Not this time.
Seattle's defense rebounds after that nightmarish game in the rain
and mud at Kansas City last Sunday. Look for the Seattle defense to
shine and for Ricky Watters to outrush Terrell Davis. And receiver
Joey Galloway vs. the Broncos secondary is a matchup quarterback
Warren Move will seek early and late. Seahawks, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Jets (2-2) vs. Rams (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Jets (6) _ Sacks allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Rams (4) _ Winning streak in series.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Rams play after a bye, and the Jets enter having
won a big game at home against Miami. Now the Jets seek to keep it
going while the Rams hope to start something. The Jets shut down
the Miami running game, and doing the same against the Rams won't
be too much of a problem. But stopping their passing game is
another thing. Isaac Bruce is by far a better receiver than anyone
Miami has, and he deserves special attention. Keeping him in check
and pressuring quarterack Tony Banks, flushing him from the pocket
and forcing him to throw on the run, are the key essential for a
Jets victory. It happens. Jets, 27-20.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (2-3) vs. Oakland (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Chargers (36.5) _ Leaf's QB rating.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders (95.2) _ Run defense.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The visiting team has won in the last four games in
this series, but the Raiders will put a halt to that. San Diego
owns the top-ranked run defense in the AFC (87.0 avg. yards allowed
per game), and it will be fun watching to see if that defense can
contain speedy Raiders back Napolean Kauffman. The Raiders are 8-3
when Kauffman rushes for 100 yards. The Chargers need Leaf to rise
and improve and become more steady. He started fast (2-0) and has
sunk (0-3). The Raiders will hound him, especially safety Eric
Turner and cornerback Charles Woodson. Raiders, 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT GAME, 8 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (3-1) vs. Giants (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Falcons (11) _ League-low rushing first downs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (7-3) _ At home under Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Giants usually play well at home under coach Jim
Fassel. And they have been able to rebound from horrible games
under Fassel, too. This is a big one, with Dan Reeves, the former
Giants coach, returning as Atlanta coach. This game boils down to
one thing: the Giants have been unable to run the ball, and the
Falcons have not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 12 straight games.
Can the Giants produce an instant running game? They will come
close. And that will save them. Barely. Giants, 19-17.

AMIDST BASEBALL PLAYOFFS AND NBA LOCKOUT, HOCKEY OPENS ITS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds, a team-by-team preview, broken down by division of the NHL) 
(JT) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; EASTERN CONFERENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ATLANTIC DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEVILS _ Coach Robbie Ftorek, replacing Jacques Lemaire, must
inspire a mechanical team that pulled its own plug in the playoffs.
The Scott Niedermayer contract hassle is another penny-wise power
play by General Manager Lou Lamoriello. He may save money and win,
but at what cost? With new rules favoring attackers, this veteran
defense could seem a step slower. And someone must fill Doug
Gilmour's center slot.
</P>
<P>
   ISLANDERS _ The heavy-handed fiasco over the lease at Nassau
Coliseum is an embarrassment to the league. The reluctance of the
new owners to sign Zigmund Palffy shortchanges the fans. If the
commissioner's office can suspend players for bad conduct, why
can't it discipline owners like Howard Millstein and Steven
Gluckstern?
</P>
<P>
   RANGERS _ This deeply flawed team needs major rebuilding. It
should improve, nevertheless, over last season's underachievement.
John Muckler, a first-rate coach, could get them back in the
playoffs _ assuming Brian Leetch and Mike Richter rebound. General
Manager Neil Smith, under pressure in his 10th season, must deal
for a center or a high-scoring wing. Although everyone admires the
gracefully aging Wayne Gretzky, it is hard to shape a team around a
20-year veteran, even a Great One.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA FLYERS _ By turning up the heat under Eric Lindros
this summer, General Manager Bob Clarke deflected attention from
his failure to solve his goaltending problem. Now that Clarke has
chosen John Vanbiesbrouck as his goalie, net, he can contemplate
the hole left on his defense by his perplexing trade of Janne
Niinimaa.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH PENGUINS _ More than most general managers, Craig
Patrick thrives under difficult circumstances. But it will be
harder than ever with two warring co-owners and without Ron
Francis. Why not trade Petr Nedved, a no-show, for two or three
important components?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NORTHEAST DIVISON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seasons of great improvement are often followed by a
plateau or a dip. Watch out, Bruins. It would be nice if Joe
Thornton's second year is as good as Sergei Samsonov's first. For
Ray Bourque, it's 20 seasons _ any decade now, he'll slow down.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Lindy Ruff's coaching debut was spectacular, healing
bruised egos and leading a mediocre cast into the third round of
the playoffs. Three consecutive Hart and Vezina trophies may be too
much to ask from goalie Dominik Hasek. Defenseman Aleksei Zhitnik
is ripening into a Norris Trophy contender, but he is one of four
unsigned players.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Uncertain goaltending is just one of the problems.
The brewery ownership is easing off the money tap. Despite a
dynastic history, the Canadiens seem settled in the middle of the
pack. Aside from Saku Koivu, few Canadiens are much fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Last season's improvement may be hard to continue.
Injuries will delay the debuts of forward Daniel Alfredsson and
defenseman Janne Laukkanen. Rick Dudley replaces Pierre Gautheir as
general manager. Now that he is the captain, can Aleksei Yashin
reach the next level of maturity and stardom?
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO _ So far, the team president Ken Dryden's best move has
been to join a division with Canadian neighbors Ottawa and
Montreal. He and his top aide, Mike Smith, also acquired goalie
Curtis Joseph as a free agent and hired Pat Quinn as coach. Amid a
shrill media and fan environment, the Leafs will soon leave their
old Garden for a new arena and, maybe, a better era.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTHEAST DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA _ Ron Francis, the free-agent center signed from
Pittsburgh, might be a good fit behind Keith Primeau. With one year
until the Raleigh arena is finished, the Hurricanes will block out
thousands of their 21,000 seats with drapes to make the small
crowds in Greensboro seem larger. The fans may like the improving
team they see.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA _ General Manager Bryan Murray has hired brother Terry
to coach this free-falling team. A new arena is just Phase One of
the franchise's overall reconstruction project. It is optimistic to
think of newly signed goalie Sean Burke as a cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY _ Most general managers with his track record would be
gone by now. But Phil Esposito, a survivor, has a new owner to
bamboozle. A franchise like this could ruin a top prospect like
Vincent Lecavalier. Coach Jacques Demers, dismissed from New
Jersey, is a turnaround specialist who gets the last, best effort
from veteran discards. Esposito has given him many, like Wendel
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After losing Stanley Cup finals, the Florida
Panthers and Philadelphia Flyers regressed. It could happen to the
Capitals, the surprising finalists last June. Dmitri Mironov joins
a better-than-average defense. Peter Bondra is the best of a so-so
offense. Can Goalie Olaf Kolzig equal the best season of his
career?

   &UR; WESTERN CONFERENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CENTRAL DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dirk Graham, a rookie coach, is not much older than
two of his stars: Chris Chelios, the venerable defenseman, and Doug
Gilmour, the well-traveled center who arrives as a free agent. They
missed the playoffs for the first time in almost three decades, and
they might not be back this spring.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With two rings in hand, the Wings might be the first
team since the Islanders to win the Stanley Cup three times in
succession. If he returns, Coach Scotty Bowman will arrive late,
after recovering from heart and knee surgery. Brendan Shanahan may
no longer be a top-echelon power forward. Uwe Krupp, a free agent
from Colorado, arrives to bolster the defense as Slava Fetisov
retires.
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ After serving an apprenticeship under the Devils'
Martin Brodeur, Mike Dunham gets a chance to prove he is a
first-string goalie with what could be a last-place expansion team.
Tom Fitzgerald, a veteran with experience in winning programs, is a
good choice for captain. With a new arena in a new market, hockey
could climb the sports charts in the country-music capital.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Blues were fun to watch again and they finished
with the fourth-best record in the NHL. But they might miss Brett
Hull and Steve Duchesne. Goalie Grant Fuhr may finally be wearing
out as Jamie McLennan ripens. On defense, Chris Pronger is reaching
elite status while Al MacInnis is still there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NORTHWEST DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CALGARY _ Since the 1989 Stanley Cup, this has become a
low-budget, fading franchise. Veteran goalie Ken Wregget, acquired
from Pittsburgh, might help, but how much and for how long? Despite
a youth movement, they've added ancient defensemen Steve Smith and
Phil Housley. Down the trail, the franchise stampede away from
Canada could include this Alberta team.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO _ Has it been just two years and four months since they
won the Stanley Cup? Chemistry wasn't right on a talented team that
declined sharply. Coach Bob Hartley, the rookie replacing Marc
Crawford, must replace defenseman Uwe Krupp, who signed with
Detroit, while changing a lot of attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON _ Just remaining in town is a yearly victory for the
ownership-challenged Oilers. The loss of goalie Curtis Joseph can't
help a mediocre but interesting group. This low-scoring, low-budget
team must sign or trade Doug Weight, a restricted free agent. With
a coaching staff of Ron Low and Kevin Lowe, a losing streak could
unleash a blizzard of headline puns.
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ In a coastal city with mountain vistas, the team's
leadership could get volcanic. Brian Burke, a tough guy fresh from
the league office, is now the general manager in charge of
strong-willed Coach Mike Keenan and the assertive captain, Mark
Messier. Hear the rumble? Now that Pavel Bure has refused to
report, Burke could begin rebuilding with a major deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PACIFIC DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Having switched from Ottawa to Anaheim, can General
Manager Pierre Gauthier rebuild another struggling team? Paul
Kariya's recovery from his most serious concussion will keep
everyone's fingers crossed. Beyond Kariya and Teemu Selanne, the
Ducks still lack depth and defensemen. Any year now, the Disney
ownership should begin investing good money for more good players.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Brett Hull, signed as a free agent, could be the final
element of a Stanley Cup combination. An exhibition-season
suspension shows big Derian Hatcher as mean as ever. Much depends
on Joe Nieuwendyk's comeback from knee surgery and goalie Ed
Belfour's steadiness in the playoffs. Would a hockey championship
make them North America's team?
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Larry Robinson and General manager Dave
Taylor are building something nice for next season's new arena.
They got defenseman Steve Duchesne to help the power play and
complement Rob Blake, coming off a Norris Trophy season. Like
Boston, two steps forward might be followed by one step back. But
the Kings could be good in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A brief holdout by Keith Tkachuk got the Coyotes off
on the wrong skate. Jyrki Lumme, signed as a free agent from
Vancouver, makes a good defense better. At 28, center Jeremy
Roenick may already be past his prime. Same for Rich Tocchet, 34.
Despite a better-than-average roster, the Coyotes' quirky uniforms
and mis-shapen arena make this franchise hard to warm up to.
</P>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ With the free agent Gary Suter joining Bryan
Marchment, the Sharks have two of the sport's most villified
defensemen. Could it be our boys have done something rash? Last
spring's rare playoff appearance sparked new hope for one of the
sport's best-supported and most chronically disappointing teams.
Mike Vernon steadied the goaltending, and center Patrik Marleau
could be that rarest of Sharks: a young, home-grown, starring
forward.

TWO TEXAS DEMOCRATS VOTE FOR GOP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reps. Nick Lampson and Jim Turner, both freshmen
Democratic House members from Texas, were among 31 Democrats who
voted for a Republican-sponsored impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton's role in the White House sex scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson later said he voted for the wide-ranging inquiry because
``the American people deserve a quick, fair and truthful
impeachment investigation of the president that brings this matter
to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampson initially voted for a Democratic alternative that
limited the scope and time of the inquiry. However, when that
proposal failed, 236 to 198, splitting mostly along party lines,
Lampson then supported the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   He said he voted for the Republican plan ``to ensure that we are
able to move ahead in completing the investigation of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have said before, it's time to move forward with the
issues that matter most to working families _ strengthening the
economy, protecting our children and improving education,'' Lampson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who also voted for the unsuccessful Democratic option
and then for the Republican alternative, said after the vote that
Congress has a ``constitutional duty to proceed with the inquiry
into the allegation contained in the report sent to us by the
office of the independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote to proceed with the inquiry is not a vote for
impeachment _ it is a vote to allow both the president and his
accusers to have their day in court,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said proceeding with the inquiry ``will not be a pleasant
task and it must be done impartially with the utmost care and
diligence. The American people want this matter behind us, it is
the responsibility of Congress to conclude this investigation in a
fair and just manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide-ranging inquiry that the House approved by a 258-176
vote Thursday makes Clinton the third president in history to face
the threat of removal from office by Congress.

`HAPPINESS': FAULTY FAMILIES WHERE DESSERT IS HARD TO TAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Don't worry,'' coos the famous, successful,
beautiful sister. ``I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   A look of dismay. ``But I'm not laughing,'' the other sister
replies.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken only two films, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' and
now ``Happiness,'' for Todd Solondz to establish his as one of the
most lacerating, funny and distinctive voices in American film. In
his hands, passive aggression is a deadly weapon, right there in
the arsenal alongside perky suburban decor and easy-listening
songs. (``Happiness'' deploys both ``You Light Up My Life'' and
``Mandy.'') Yet kitschy Americana does not apparently interest him
as a target for sardonic potshots. It interests him as a matter of
proportion. There are people out there who are more bothered when a
child's Tamagotchi dies than when a clean-cut relative turns out to
be a serial pederast. Solondz wants to know how they tick.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Happiness,'' a much bigger film than his first and another
murderous comedy of manners, Solondz gets even closer to the bone.
His natural tendency to make audiences squirm leads him into
material that wouldn't be mentioned in many other films; here, it's
linked to the eating of ice cream sundaes. But Solondz doesn't seem
to be straining for shock value when he turns the man in the sunny
family portrait on the wall into the man who drugs his family's
dessert. (His purpose: an assault on the son's young friend.) He
fills ``Happiness'' with enough misery to make its most outrageous
joke its title _ and with enough true, unexpected tenderness to
warrant this view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' revolves around the lives of three sisters and
observes their romantic lives with enough acid precision to make it
a ``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional
times. Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is the glamour girl, the celebrity
writer who complains: ``I hate Saturday nights. Everybody wants me.
You have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   One look at her and you're meant to hate her along with Allen
(Philip Seymour Hoffman), her timid neighbor. Allen makes obscene
phone calls so furtively that one of the funniest things in the
film is watching him try to switch gears and behave normally
(``Seen the playoffs last night?'') with the guys at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Helen's sister Joy, played with hilarious tremulousness by Jane
Adams, is the dartboard in a family that also includes chirpy Trish
(Cynthia Stevenson). Trish looks as pert as her name suggests and
has a wonderful time pitying Joy's single status. (``Just because
you've hit 30 doesn't mean you can't be fresh any more!'') But the
film, which also features Louise Lasser and Ben Gazzara as the
suitably unhappy parents of this brood and Jon Lovitz and Jared
Harris as the funniest of Joy's Wrongs, veers right out of
situation comedy and into what was once the unspeakable when it
gets to Trish's husband. He (Dylan Baker, in a brave and chilling
performance) is known as Dr. Maplewood by the little boys who look
up to him.
</P>
<P>
   In depicting this doctor, who lives a secret life of shame and
prurience, and talks so matter of factly about male sexuality with
his son (Rufus Read) that ``Happiness'' was dropped by its original
distributor (October Films, owned by Universal Seagram), Solondz
lives up to his growing reputation for shock value. There can be no
more shocking view of the doctor than an understanding one. And in
the same way he made viewers share the junior high school
humiliations of ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' Solondz calmly draws
his audience into sharing the doctor's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Not without humor, of course. When Dr. Maplewood tells his
therapist that his latest dream of shooting up a public park ends
without suicide, the therapist remarks, ``You see this as something
positive?''
</P>
<P>
   This sequence is shot with an imaginative crane maneuver by
Maryse Alberti, who also gives such visual flair to Todd Haynes'
``Velvet Goldmine.'' It's a shot that pulls away from the doctor's
bland exterior until it reaches parts unknown. This funny yet
frightening film works the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness,'' which could have gone with an NC-17 rating for
its masturbation references alone, will be released wisely unrated
when it opens commercially on Sunday. It will be shown Friday and
Saturday as part of the New York Film Festival.

`RUSHMORE': A CUTTHROAT BOYHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This guy looks awfully familiar. Don't we know him
from somewhere? Is it the yearbook pictures, the ones that show him
with the Piper Cub Club or leading the beekeepers' society? Is it
the way he wrote and directed the school's most unbearable plays?
Isn't he the crossing guard who used his job to hit on friends'
mothers? Remember how he gave the orders and outsmarted the
teachers? Probably he has grown up to be a captain of industry and
loves reminiscing about his hard climb to the top.
</P>
<P>
   This portrait of the mogul as a young man arrives courtesy of
Wes Anderson, whose bright, spiky ``Rushmore'' has the brainstorm
of envisioning a 15-year-old tycoon-wannabe as a schoolboy. At
Rushmore Academy, in scenes filmed at the director's own Texas alma
mater, horrid little Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) calls the
shots. Oh, sure, the place has faculty, but none of the grown-ups
has anything like Max's natural authority. Maybe one man on the
scene, the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor played with all the
right wiles by Bill Murray, is right on the same wavelength with
Max.
</P>
<P>
   While the film embroils Max and the mogul in pursuit of the same
beautiful teacher (Olivia Williams), it's a particular treat for
its skewed, hilarious memories of a cutthroat boyhood. Bespectacled
Max, who's as much of a sight gag for the wide-angle lens as he is
a flesh-and-blood character, starts off on top of the Rushmore
world and experiences a wonderfully welcome comeuppance. He's meant
to be mellowing along the way, but ``Rushmore'' wouldn't dare turn
sentimental about that. As directed by Anderson and written by him
with Owen Wilson (his partner on ``Bottle Rocket,'' which
``Rushmore'' far surpasses), it's too smart to be maudlin. Far
better to show off Max's Vietnam play, with real explosives
(earplugs and safety glasses available) or let him boast derangedly
(in one especially funny dinner scene) about having a hit to his
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Casting notes about ``Rushmore,'' which also includes a sweet
turn by Seymour Cassel as Max's father and a sputteringly indignant
one from Brian Cox as the headmaster: Of the many who auditioned
for Max's role, some actors spontaneously showed up in preppy
looking blazers. But Schwartzman earned the part by among other
things being the only one who actually made a fake Rushmore patch.
And since Ms. Williams' only other theatrical film credit is
appearing opposite Kevin Costner in ``The Postman,'' this amounts
to her feature debut.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the same bill at the New York Film Festival is another
delightful film about a rite of passage, Xavier Giannoli's
17-minute ``Interview.'' This rueful black-and-white French short
presents a real story, and it's one that couldn't have been made
up: a fledgling journalist's dream interview with his beloved Ava
Gardner, and the learning experience this debacle became. The
reporter is played wonderfully by Matthieu Amalric, also starring
in ``Late August, Early September'' and looking more and more like
his generation's Jean-Pierre Leaud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' and ``The Interview'' will be shown Friday night at
9:15 and Saturday at noon as part of the New York Film Festival.

 &HT;    Author Fowler ups credibility of `Classical' fare
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _It was a scene-stealing outburst that would have
made Bette Davis proud. A bespectacled young architect was at a
dinner party with friends back in the late '80s. Somebody made a
disparaging remark about Southern food _ ``What Southern cuisine?
You mean fried chicken?'' _ and the architect just went off on the
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yes, fried chicken!'' he said, knocking over a glass of
red wine. ``Every great cuisine in the world has it. What's the
matter with it? And what's the matter with us? Why are we so
fascinated by other cuisines and so insecure about our own? What's
wrong with our own culinary heritage?''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Damon Fowler set out on a mission to change the
way people think about Southern food. ``You go to places that
advertise good Southern cooking, and it's canned lima beans with
that cheap, water-impregnated smoked ham in it, and that's not
Southern cooking by any stretch of the imagination,'' says the
Newnan-born writer, who grew up in South Carolina. ``It's this bad
parody of Southern food, and yet you go to those chain places and
the parking lot is full.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scent of his grandmother's kitchen in his memory _ and
a passion for food that was awakened while he was a student in
Italy _ he was em-
</P>
<P>
   boldened to quit his job at a Savannah architecture firm in 1993
and write cookbooks. Combining historical rigor and a personal
sensibility, his ``Classical Southern Cooking'' celebrates a nearly
forgotten 19th-century cuisine that's almost decadent in its
melding of European restraint with West African verve. Appearing in
1995, the book was nominated for a James Beard Award and two
International Association of Culinary Professionals/Julia Child
Cookbook awards. This summer, he published ``Beans, Greens and
Sweet Georgia Peaches'' (Broadway, $17.50), a collection of recipes
for fruits and vegetables done Southern style. At the moment, he's
finishing a book of fried chicken recipes from around the world _
due from Broadway Books in the spring _ and licking his fingers
with the satisfaction of having turned a dinner-party tiff into a
successful second career.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Damon Fowler is the youngest member of the Holy Trinity
of Lowcountry food writers that includes high priestess Karen Hess
and her chief acolyte, Hoppin' John Martin Taylor of Charleston.
Fowler keeps Sarah Rutledge's ``The Carolina Housewife'' on his
office mantelpiece, right next to his Book of Common Prayer and
``Mrs. Hill's Southern Practical Cookery and Receipt Book,'' a
facsimile edition of a 19th-century LaGrange housewife's tome that
he edited for the University of South Carolina Press (1995). He's
friends with Italian maven Marcella Hazan, preaches an Alice
Waters-like philosophy of seasonality and has won the respect of
peers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American no longer has a memory of what good food
is like,'' he says. ``They go to these nouvelle restaurants, and
they eat this fusion junk. They think that's supposed to be good
food, so they carry on about it, when in fact it's just weird.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent day _ as he picked over produce at the local
market, shelled peas in his courtyard and cooked a delicious lunch
of crispy fried chicken, okra steamed with a little olive oil,
field peas, fried green tomatoes and green beans with new potatoes
_ he was more the country-boy cutup than gastronomic grinch.
Changing from shorts and a blue linen shirt into a pair of cutoffs
that television's Daisy Dukes would be happy to own, he was a bona
fide Huckleberry ham. On the settee of his front parlor, in a
19th-century brick townhouse on West Bolton Street, is an
embroidered pillow that says: ``I've had sex and I've had food and
I'd rather eat.''
</P>
<P>
   He jokes about going from being a Southern Baptist preacher's
kid to singing in the choir at St. John's Episcopal Church (``God's
frozen people''). Though he's a licensed tour guide in this town of
good and evil, he says that just means he's ``licensed to tell
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   And he talks about his gardening grandfather's last tomato _ he
died before he could eat it _ with an almost tearful poignancy.
``He wanted a tomato that would hang out of the sides of the bread.
... That was hard eating that tomato. We let it sit on the counter
until we realized that Levis would be real upset at us if we didn't
eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls his maternal grandmother ``Maw-Maw'' and says that to
this day the creaming of butter and sugar into cake batter causes
her image to appear in his heart. ``I can close my eyes, and I am
back in my grandmother's kitchen. That smell is my grandmother's
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Adams Bronz, a Texas-born chef and writer who re-
</P>
<P>
   views food books for The New York Times, recalls the first time
she met Fowler. He was on a book tour of the Northeast, and she was
his chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a cross between this very confident TV chef and your
Aunt Millie,'' Bronz says. ``He's not one of those threatening chef
Nazis who terrifies you with technique. ... He takes the food dead
seriously, but he doesn't take himself seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she says, he's got the nerve to call heavyweights such as
Hess, Hazan and Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him first by a letter that he wrote me and was charmed
by it,'' says Atlanta-based food icon Nathalie Dupree. ``He's a
Southern renaissance man. He's the kind of person who you think
will always do the right thing, but with an amazing sense of humor
and quite a different slant. He doesn't run with the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Fowler's interest in art that led him to food. A graduate
student in architecture at Clemson University, he went to Genoa in
1978 to study Palladio and Brunelleschi and ended up weak-kneed
over pasta and pan rustica. ``What really struck me in retrospect
was how familiar it all was. What struck me most was that
minestrone was my grandmother's vegetable soup. I understood it
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the States, he bought Hazan's books and cooked through
them. Eventually, he wrote her a fan letter, and she answered that
she and her husband, Victor, might like to come to Savannah
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't meet her in Italy. Somehow people got the notion that
I studied with her. The most I ever studied with her were those two
days that they were here, and I got these mini-cooking lessons in
my kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   He loves to tell about the time he was making salad dressing _
with lots of vinegar _ and Hazan yelled: ```That's enough!''' Then
she realized she wasn't in her own cucina.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh, excuse me,''' Fowler says, mimicking her accent. ```I'm
under your table.' Her big thing was `I'm under your roof.'''
</P>
<P>
   Based on what she heard about his first book idea _ or maybe it
was his corn sticks _ she decided to put her name behind it. It
took him seven years to finish, and it's dedicated to Hazan, Hess
and his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Oliver, a Maine writer whose award-winning ``Saltwater
Foodways'' is a classic piece of regional culinary history, says
that Fowler is universally admired. ``If I had a question about
Southern food, I'd call Damon first.''
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes his work, she says, is that he does more than
shuffle through old recipes. ``I think he pays attention to the
recipes, but I don't think he stops there. He comes at it with a
sense of fun. That makes it. That gives it a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has a collection of Victoriana _ including a bust of
the British monarch with the label ``Our Lady of Non-Amusement''
attached to the base _ and though he specializes in 19th-century
food, Fowler is forward-thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to keep building on history,'' he says. ``We don't
need to forget our roots and lose them, but we don't need to wallow
in them, either. You can't go back. We wouldn't want to go back. I
don't want a kitchen with an open hearth and no Cuisinart.''

 &HT;    No sale: Murphy's `Holy Man' pitch lacks quality control
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New Age home shopping guru G (Eddie Murphy) gives his TV
viewers an instruction, they pour out of their homes into the
evening air, determined to follow his bidding. It's the blatant
``Network'' moment in ``Holy Man.'' But instead of Peter Finch's
``I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore,'' G's mantra
is a soft-minded reflection of the movie: ``Just go look at some
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   In this comedy/drama/something-or-other, Murphy's drapery-clad
character drifts into the lives of Good Buy Shopping Network
producer Ricky (Jeff Goldblum) and media analyst Kate (Kelly
Preston), who's been hired to do something about Ricky's droopy
sales. In the words of Ricky's boss (Robert Loggia), the job is
about ``making people feel they have to have it when they don't
really want it.'' That applies equally to dinette sets, welcome
mats and cheesy, 2-karat gold bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that G, whom Ricky improbably invites to live with
him after a car-accident encounter, is the answer to all problems.
Whenever he goes on camera, his presence is so Zenfully refreshing
that people buy whatever he's hawking. Even when he tells them not
to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Good idea here. Lousy follow-up. The movie shows Jewish
scholars, Catholic priests and other religious leaders claiming
that G is one of their sect. That's easy to believe, because G
spouts a Cliffs Notes version of faith that can be more easily
traced to a Hallmark store than to any place of worship. In the
wake of ``What Dreams May Come,'' this is the second Hollywood film
in two weeks that boils spirituality down to, basically, ``Give
somebody a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, ain't nothing wrong with that. But it would help if the
movie were entertaining. From scene to scene, the soundtrack goes
from manic yuck-yuck chords to soul-stirring strings in its uneasy
bid to find a tone.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's high points are satiric clips of some of the
network's spots, including good-natured cameos from folks like
James Brown, Dan Marino, Florence Henderson and Morgan Fairchild.
If you think Fairchild's much-plugged scene getting an electric
face zap is indicative of the movie, don't be fooled. The jokes are
mild and far between.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be fooled by Murphy's top billing. His screen time is
surprisingly limited. The movie is about Ricky and Kate's
transition from scummy yuppie values to smell-the-flowers
enlightenment. Goldblum, as usual, is a twitchy, neurotic pro; his
prolonged reaction after he thinks he's just drunk someone's urine
is classic. Preston fares less well in a role that requires her to
be, well, blond.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Murphy. He's charming, as always. But fans of ``The
Nutty Professor'' and ``Doctor Dolittle'' shouldn't come expecting
to find him at his quicksilver, risque best. (The movie is rated
PG, but it's too bland for kids.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is that G is a literal blank, with no given
background or character trait besides a generalized West Coast
beatitude. In this movie, he exists solely to bring the white folks
together. Alerting them to problems they didn't know existed,
pointing them in the right direction, he's hardly human. He's not
Goldblum and Preston's guru; he's their spiritual Lassie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Man''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and Kelly Preston. Directed
by Stephen Herek. Rated PG. One hour, 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An unholy mess.

 &HT;    Alice Walker's new life mission: To simply `be'
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Walker, a tireless activist and self-styled seeker, has
found a new passion: being a homebody. At age 54, the small,
soft-spoken author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Color
Purple'' is making no new promises to read or lecture. ``I'm just
interested in going home,'' Walker says. ``In being there. In just
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years after her provocative novel ``Possessing the Secret of
Joy,'' about the ancient rite of female circumcision, Walker, a
native of Eatonton who lives now in northern California, is on tour
promoting a new novel. ``By the Light of My Father's Smile'' is the
story of an African-American family _ two daughters and their
parents _ who settle in the remote Sierras of Mexico for several
years to study a mixed-race tribe of Indians and blacks called the
Mundo. When the 15-year-old daughter becomes sexually involved with
a Mundo boy, her father beats her in a scene witnessed by her
sister. Both girls are scarred for life, and the father narrates
much of the novel posthumously, watching his daughters from an
otherworldly perch.
</P>
<P>
   As in most of Walker's work, there is much spirituality, a
laundry list of causes the author believes in, a touch of
redemption and a lot of explicit sex. On a recent stop to read and
sign books at Emory University, Walker talked with Atlanta
Journal-Constitution book editor Teresa Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you care about reviews? Do you read them?
</P>
<P>
   A:Not while I'm on tour. I don't want to take the chance that
they are going to bother me.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What drives you? Is it a desire to write or a desire to spread
a particular message?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's really a curiosity about the world, and a lot of love for
people. And some feeling of responsibility for the younger
generations of people, and also for the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In a recent interview in Ms. magazine, you refer to yourself
as an elder. What goes along with that role?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, an elder is someone who begins to operate from a sense
of responsibility for the collective rather than just
responsibility for themselves. You can be 10 and be an elder. It's
about responsibility rather than about age. Although, as I was
saying in that Ms. article, in ancient Cherokee tradition you
become an adult when you're 52 _ because generally by that age
you've raised your children, you're independent, and you are an
adult. Then you're required to speak about the issues of the day. I
feel like I'm between that stage and the elder stage.
</P>
<P>
   Q:There's a strong spiritual element in much of your work. Does
organized religion play a role in your life?
</P>
<P>
   A:I have been fleeing from organized religion since I was 13
because I could see that it was at war with nature. And I always
felt that nature was my true ally. Fortunately, our church was too
poor to have stained glass windows, so we could look out and still
see nature. Many people have churches with ``beautiful'' stained
glass windows, but basically the function is to keep you from being
aware of how much more grand nature is than whatever is inside the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Are you a practicing Buddhist?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I studied Buddhism because it has some really, really
amazing features that are very helpful in getting through terrible
times in one's life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you meditate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. I've been meditating since I was divorced, over 20
years ago. ... The latest is Tibetan. The teaching is called
Lojong, and the meditation practice is called Tonglen. It's a
practice of breathing in pain and suffering, and breathing out what
you'd rather there be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tell me about your writing process. Is there a routine?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've never had a routine. ... For me, it's more about being
in rhythm with my own growth. It really is like a well or a spring.
The discipline is not to overtax it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What contemporary authors do you read?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really love Clarissa Pinkola Estes' work. She wrote ``Women
Who Run With the Wolves.'' I think she's an extraordinary
storyteller and healer, and she's dealing with issues of such major
soul importance. ... I find her to be the one indispensable
contemporary author.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's talk about your latest work. The father-daughter
dynamic is central to the story. Can you talk about your
relationship with your father?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. No, I'm not interested in talking about my father, but I
can talk about father-daughter relationships. That goes back really
to my earlier novel, ``Possessing the Secret of Joy.'' Because when
I really understood how debased and really destroyed female
sexuality is at that end of the spectrum of oppression ... I
started to understand that this is an area that is so imperiled, we
have to have an antidote. ... And when thinking about how to
counterbalance such practices, it was very clear that we would have
to deeply involve fathers in the affirmation of their daughters'
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How autobiographical is your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think everything a writer writes is autobiographical, even
if you write about a table, because it comes from you. The fiction
is generally fiction, and the essays are generally essays, but
since it's all coming from me, it is autobiographical. I am the
garden from which all of this grows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You are frequently banned from school libraries because of
the subject matter and the graphic nature of what you write about.
Does that bother you? Or does it incite you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not really about the graphic nature. Two of my books,
for instance, were banned in California schools, and one was about
a horse, and the other one was about a Christian woman marrying a
Muslim man. They said one was anti-meat-eating, since it made you
feel sympathy for the horse, and the other was anti-religion, since
the woman before her wedding questioned the nature of religion.
See, it's not always about graphic nature. It's about control.
Control of many kinds of information. But you know, that's their
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do the ideas for your novels come from? Say, with
``Possessing the Secret of Joy,'' do you come up with an issue that
you want to address and build the fiction around it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had heard about that practice (of female circumcision) long
before I wrote ``Possessing the Secret of Joy.'' ... Frankly, I
don't know how you can live with certain issues. It took me years
and years and years to learn how to deal with it in such a way that
people wouldn't just run screaming from the room _ or leap right
into the biggest, fattest denial. I understood I had to create an
object that people could approach, open up and peek into, keeping a
certain amount of distance. When I took that book around the
country, everywhere I went, women fainted as I read.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the end, did that book accomplish what you wanted?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. It started it. Now there are laws ... and people
are talking about it. I think writing very forthrightly about
sexuality encourages people to see it as enlightenment, not as
evil, reminding them that they needn't be hobbled by a tradition
that is detrimental to women and to children. They don't have to
believe that Eve did anything wrong just because she was curious.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've said that it is the fathers' responsibility to help
daughters establish their sexual identity. Does the mother not play
a role?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, of course. But you know, mothers are there. Although
often they don't share much information. My mother didn't start
talking to me about sex until after I was married and had a baby.
And I thought: Why didn't you talk to me when I really needed to
know? Now I've figured it out. ...
</P>
<P>
   But I think because the father has been set up as the watchdog
over the daughters' sexuality, it's very important that we go
directly to the father consciousness. What is a father? What does
it mean to be a father of a pubescent girl? I think so many men
have no idea. They have no idea. They have run off to the football
game and the corner store. ... Meanwhile, these little girls _ who
up until this point have been Daddy's darlings _ start falling
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in angels?
</P>
<P>
   A: Spirit is more like it for me. I think the spirits of our
ancestors are quite present if we're open to that. As in the Mundo
world, I think it's the spirits that come back and take care of
people. As for myself, I have always felt very supported by
ancestral spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides meditating, what keeps you grounded?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do a lot of walking and a lot of gardening. You know, just
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been an activist since your college days. Are there
particular pet causes now?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, actually I'm more interested in being home right now. ...
I love being at home. I think more people should stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've said you're going to cut back on interviews and
lectures. Is that temporary?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know. Life is a river and it keeps on going. There's
no way of knowing what's coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you working on any new projects?
</P>
<P>
   A: Getting through this book tour is my only project right now!
I am not looking ahead at all. One of the practices that I love
about Buddhism is that it reinforces our instinct to live in the
present. There's no future, no past. You're just right there. It's
wonderful, so I don't have all these plans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any film projects under way involving your work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, something kind of interesting is the possibility of
making ``The Color Purple'' into a musical for Broadway. And some
producer is interested in making a film of (``By the Light of My
Father's Smile'').
</P>
<P>
   Q: So are there any taboos left for you to break?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, I hope not. Because it takes a lot out of you.

 &HT;    `One Tough Cop' uses one old plot
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From its wet city streets to its climactic bloody Pieta, ``One
Tough Cop'' plays like a generic, cable-ready police procedural.
That makes a couple of things about it especially surprising.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was made by a good director, Bruno Barreto (``Four
Days in September''). Second, despite its familiar, pulp-fiction
tale about the thin line between organized crime and cops on the
take, the movie is inspired by actual events. That just goes to
show that life can sometimes play like a mediocre TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baldwin, starting to get the Baldwin brothers' curse of
chunkiness, plays New York police Detective Bo Dietl. He's a great
cop, but there's a problem: His best childhood friend is Richie
(Mike McGlone), who happens to be an underboss in the Florio crime
family.
</P>
<P>
   Since cops and crooks aren't usually best pals, Bo draws the
attention of a couple of FBI agents, who think he's on the take. It
doesn't help that Bo's partner, Duke (Chris Penn), is a gambler
deep in hock to a Florio loan shark (Paul Guilfoyle).
</P>
<P>
   The movie also throws in the case of a raped, mutilated nun (a
real-life event, which also inspired Abel Ferrara's ``Bad
Detective''). But the film's main badge-or-brotherhood crisis
centers on the men and their strained loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin turns in a competent performance, but he's one of those
actors with dead eyes; nothing seems to be going on inside his
character. Penn's hotheaded loser may remind you of Edward Norton's
character in ``Rounders.'' Just as in that movie, Baldwin's
continued forbearance of his partner's recklessness comes to seem
less like loyalty, more like stupidity. We lose sympathy for both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   McGlone is fine, but as soon as his girlfriend (Gina Gershon in
a tissue-thin role) starts to make eyes at Baldwin, you can bet
somebody will use the words ``Judas'' before the flick is over.
That's the trouble. ``Cop'' plays like a movie you've already seen
a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   Director Barreto shoots with solid skill, but he doesn't do any
favors for his real-life wife, Amy Irving. She turns up as one of
the stiff-lipped, humor-impaired feds. As she snarls lines like
``Dietl, we know you're dirty'' and ``Say goodbye to your career,
Dietl,'' you'll mainly be impressed that she keeps a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Tough Cop''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Baldwin, Chris Penn and Mike McGlone. Directed
by Bruno Barreto. Rated R for strong violence and language. One
hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: One cliched movie.

 &HT;    Latest `Lolita' short on steam
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roman Polanski once said that the difference between eroticism
and pornography is simple: ``Eroticism is when you use a feather;
pornography is when you use the whole chicken.'' Since Adrian
Lyne's new version of Vladimir Nabokov's novel ``Lolita'' isn't
erotic and certainly isn't pornographic, perhaps you could say Lyne
used a rubber chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he should have. It might've picked things up.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing we see onscreen is the credit ``Showtime
Presents,'' a blatant reminder of the film's checkered history.
Made by Lyne several years ago for $60 million, ``Lolita'' became a
cause/scandal when American movie studios decided to pass up
distribution rights. After knocking around Europe _ and pretty much
getting knocked by the European critics _ ``Lolita'' was finally
picked up by the cable TV channel Showtime and aired several times
in August. It was also, before its television debut, screened
theatrically in Los Angeles to make it eligible for the Academy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Now the film is being picked up nationally and in Atlanta,
thanks to art-house exhibitor George Lefont, a longtime believer in
letting local moviegoers decide for themselves whether or not they
want to see something potentially ``controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the picture's past. What is presently onscreen is
neither a triumph nor a travesty. The 1962 Stanley Kubrick version,
a frisky black comedy starring James Mason and Peter Sellers, is a
better movie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are several things to recommend Lyne's take on
Nabokov's tale of a 40-ish college professor, Humbert Humbert
(Jeremy Irons), who falls in love with his landlady's (Melanie
Griffith) adolescent daughter, Lolita (newcomer Dominique Swain).
Frank Langella also appears in the small role of Clare Quilty,
another man who knows _ and appreciates _ a nymphet when he sees
one.
</P>
<P>
   Irons, who can look more soddenly doleful than any other actor I
know, is quite effective as the middle-aged Humbert, caught in the
grip of his Lolita obsession. His voice-over readings of Nabokov's
prose are a treat, caressing such passages as Humbert's famous
incantation, ``Lolita. Light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin,
my soul. Lo-lee-ta.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith fares less well, serving mostly to remind us how deftly
Shelley Winters handled the same role in Kubrick's film. However,
young Swain _ she was 15 when filming began _ is rather good as
Lolita. In early scenes, she captures the preteen's instinctive yet
still unconscious flexing of her sexual power. Never as obvious as
Kubrick's tarty Lo, Sue Lyon, Swain has a gawky yet sensual appeal
that seems just right.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Lyne shows so little affinity for the material _
aside from recognizing its name value _ that he gets in his actors'
way. His attempts at comedy are woeful but, luckily, sporadic. Far
more of a problem is his gauzy, Victoria's Secret style and
sledgehammer approach. We get to see Lolita sucking on something _
a popsicle or an ice cream soda straw _ far too often. The repeated
close-ups of Irons _ a sallow, haunted slave to lust _ aren't just
unflattering; they're overkill.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an overlong, sometimes sluggish film. If you're
interested, check it out for yourself. But check your libido
outside. For Lyne, ``Lolita'' is truly a love story in which love
means never having to say ... jailbait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. Directed by Adrian
Lyne. Rated R for aberrant sexuality, nudity and brief violence. 2
hours,5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Too much Adrian Lyne, not enough Vladimir Nabokov.

 &HT;    `It's been an iffy sort of ride'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When British director Adrian Lyne shot his remake of ``Lolita,''
he never anticipated the long battle he would have trying to find a
U.S. distributor for the film, due to the pedophilic subject matter
of Vladimir Nabokov's book. The drama, starring Jeremy Irons and
15-year-old Dominique Swain, was ultimately broadcast on the
Showtime cable network this summer before being picked up for
theatrical distribution by Samuel Goldwyn Films.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne, who also directed ``Flashdance,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and
``Indecent Proposal,'' spoke recently by telephone from his New
York home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you relieved to finally see ``Lolita'' hit theaters?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jesus, yes. I was relieved when Showtime showed it, but it's
been an iffy sort of ride. Recently what's been good is that the
press embraced it. At the beginning, I think they didn't know what
to expect, and they reviewed me. I think they thought it would be
acres of flesh and were disappointed it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you get your first hint that you'd have problems
getting a distributor?
</P>
<P>
   A: What was bizarre is that I was getting terrific reactions
from studio heads, executives, agents. I had a better reaction to
this film than to anything I've done. So it was strange when I
stopped hearing from people. Decisions were being made above the
studio heads, corporate decisions not to get involved in the
subject matter. I kept thinking every week that it would be picked
up, and I was staggered when it wasn't. (Hollywood) is not a town
renowned for its courage, and it was apparently much easier to say
``no'' than ``yes.'' I shouldn't have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, times have changed enormously in this country since I
first embarked on this eight years ago. I worked with David Mamet
and Harold Pinter (on adaptations of the novel). But at that stage
the JonBenet (Ramsey) murder hadn't happened, and there wasn't this
international obsession with pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is it that Hollywood allows all sorts of violence
onscreen, but flinches from sexuality?
</P>
<P>
   A: They always say that you can cut off a breast, but you can't
caress it. It's a bit depressing. I don't think Scorsese could make
``Taxi Driver'' now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now it seems the timing of ``Lolita'' is all too appropriate
with its older man-younger woman situation, thanks to the Monica
Lewinsky situation.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ironically, I've seen people quoting ``Fatal Attraction'' as
well, drawing a parallel between Glenn Close and Monica Lewinsky as
the woman scorned. What is most encouraging is that the public
doesn't seem to care. The public seems to be so much more secure,
mature and sophisticated than the institutions are. On the other
hand, the people just want to get on with things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you decide to tackle ``Lolita'' for the screen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just so extraordinary, the language of the book. Nabokov
is this extraordinary juggler, really. He's an acrobat almost. He
writes about this man who is obviously quite horrendous, what he
does to this kid. But the next moment you find yourself laughing
along with him, even sympathizing. In its own strange way it is a
love story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you find Dominque Swain?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd almost decided on a professional actress, but at the last
moment the casting director said, ``Do you want to see another
amateur tape?'' I was wary because I'd seen a hundred tapes which
were horrendous _ including 35-year-old women. But she had a
tremendous sense of comedy, which was very rare. And she had one
foot in childhood and one in adulthood. It was insane, really, to
use someone who had never acted before _ it was foolhardy madness.
But she was just endlessly inventive. I would steal things that she
did. She got fed up with her chewing gum, and she'd take it out of
her mouth and stick it on her leg. So I used it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the struggle over ``Lolita'' get you off-track in terms
of moving on with new projects?
</P>
<P>
   A: A bit, to be honest. I found it terribly hard to shake off.
I've done publicity all over Europe, and at the time it was an
ongoing saga. So it's been very difficult. Now I'm reading a lot,
and I'll find something else. But it's been tough to find anything
as good. ``Lolita'' is such an extraordinary book.

 &HT;    TV talk queen Winfrey loses herself in role of a former slave as
she takes Toni Morrison's ``Beloved'' onscreen
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the past decade, she'd been dreaming, plotting,
taking meetings and even, on occasion, despairing of ever getting
it done right. And as Oprah Winfrey stood on the brink of realizing
her dream of turning Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison's novel
``Beloved'' into a movie, she did the most amazing thing of all.
</P>
<P>
   She gave up control.
</P>
<P>
   For about six hours. This is Oprah, after all, the second most
powerful woman in American business (according to Fortune
magazine), one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people and
the talk show host who turned Monica Lewinsky down for her first
interview and turned millions more TV watchers on to _ gasp! _
reading.
</P>
<P>
   But six hours was all it took for the all-powerful Winfrey to
understand what it meant to have no power at all. No voice. No
control. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To connect to that part of yourself that is told you are
nothing _ you are nothing and your thoughts do not even matter
because you can't act on them,'' Winfrey recalled of the weekend
before ``Beloved'' began filming, when she'd allowed herself first
to be blindfolded and then treated exactly like a slave _ right
down to pulling weeds and enduring the plantation overseer's verbal
humiliation. ``I'd never really felt anything like that before, and
I don't really want to feel it again. It was painful, dark and
hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was also ``life-transforming,'' said Winfrey, during a
recent interview in Atlanta. That experience strengthened her
already fierce commitment to ``Beloved'' _ she produced and stars
in the film, which opens here Friday _ which in turn strengthened
her commitment to her ``day'' job. Making ``Beloved'' during the
summer of 1997 underscored for Winfrey not just the power of having
a voice _ but of her voice in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to my producer, `It really is my life on
purpose,''' said Winfrey, 44, whose new season of shows is built
around the relatively immodest theme ``Change Your Life TV.'' ``It
is exactly what I think I was born to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds a bit much _ so many different projects, so much
self-confidence _ but this is Oprah, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Madonna and the pope are probably the three most
recognized people in the world, and she's so down-to-earth and so
sincere,'' said Anthony Cohen, the young historian who pulled
together actors, period-appropriate outfits and props, and even a
few bloodhounds so Winfrey could experience firsthand her
character's life as a slave. (Less period-appropriate, perhaps,
Cohen reassured ``Beloved's'' slightly nervous producers that a
20-man SWAT team would protect Winfrey in ``uncontrolled''
situations such as running through woods.) ``I just don't see how
she does it all. I don't know how she holds it all together, but
she constantly outdoes herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoes herself? What she did in ``Beloved,'' Winfrey said, was
lose herself. As Sethe, the onetime slave living with her teenage
daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise), in rural Ohio in 1873, Winfrey
struggles to tamp down all reminders of her painful past. The
unexpected appearance of Paul D. (Danny Glover), an old friend from
her slave days, brings male companionship for Sethe _ and
resentment from Denver, who jealously guards her relationship with
her mother. But it is the arrival of the mysterious young girl
Beloved (Thandie Newton) that truly threatens the delicate balance
in a household so full of secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey is virtually unrecognizable as Sethe, although that has
little to do with the current Vogue cover girl's period clothing
and uncoiffed hair onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's more the way this Oprah isn't ``Oprah!,'' the
ebulliently self-unediting, larger-than-life personality we almost
can't help but know through her 12 years (and still counting) on
TV, her best-selling books and videotapes and her innumerable
magazine interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Winfrey seemingly disappears into Sethe, a quietly
dignified woman whose physical and emotional scarring is gradually,
almost reluctantly, revealed as she struggles not to revisit that
painful, dark and hollow place in her head.
</P>
<P>
   This from the woman who once publicly gloated about her dieting
success by wheeling 67 pounds of animal fat onstage? Who's made her
own personal life _ from the rape and abuse she suffered as a
child, to her cocaine use as a young adult and even her longtime
relationship with ``is he or isn't he still her fiance?'' Stedman
Graham _ a virtual open book? Who made sure everyone knew she'd
decided not to be the first to interview Lewinsky _ and why _ by
discussing it both on her show and with TV Guide for a cover story?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest challenge for me not to be emotional,''
admitted Winfrey, who heavily credits director Jonathan Demme with
helping her figure out the best way to play Sethe. ``He said,
`She's already lived through it, so the telling of the story would
be nothing compared to the living of it. (With) her iron will, she
never would have allowed herself to feel that deeply.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He did that constantly,'' Winfrey continued, leaning forward
and clapping her hands loudly twice. ``Every day, `Pull it back!
Let's pull it back!'''
</P>
<P>
   But fear not, that other Oprah never really went away. How could
she have, when she was the guiding spirit behind a movie that
seemingly no one else _ not even the author of the book on which it
would be reverently, almost literally, based _ wanted to see on the
big screen?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the book, I felt that I needed to talk to
somebody, and the only person I could think of was Toni Morrison,''
said Winfrey, glancing around a cavernous suite at the Ritz-Carlton
Buckhead as if trying to see herself in 1987 when her syndicated
show was but a year old and she was less schooled in the ways of
Hollywood. ``I said, `I want to make a movie of it and you can
help!''' Winfrey went on in a self-mockingly chirpy tone. ```You
can write the screenplay if you want to!'''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison wanted no part of that, but she gave Winfrey permission
to knock herself out trying to adapt her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very naive because I had no idea how difficult it would
be to get this done,'' said Winfrey, looking a bit weary the
morning after she'd attended a post-``Beloved'' screening reception
with members of Atlanta's Hillside Chapel and Truth Center church.
``I didn't realize how difficult it was going to be to get a
screenplay written. I didn't realize that Hollywood wouldn't
immediately say, `Sure! Let's tell this story!' I didn't realize
how difficult it would be to get a director who would agree with my
vision of what the film could be. And that's why it took 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did every potential director agree she at least deserved a
shot at playing Sethe _ not even after Winfrey pledged her
assistance in finding the right actress for the role if she turned
out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essential to me that I be allowed to try, that I not be
immediately, sort of, discarded,'' said Winfrey, who'd received an
Oscar nomination for 1985's ``The Color Purple,'' then her only
previous feature film. ``Because many directors just immediately
said to me, `Well, how are you going to do that? How are you going
to produce and act?' I think they thought it was going to be some
sort of big ego diva thing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth, according to Kimberly
Elise, her ``Beloved'' co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably saw her like everybody else: this truly amazing
powerhouse, you know, an intelligent, revolutionary woman,'' Elise
said. ``And then when I got to know her ... it was like long-lost
family. She's passionate and she's very sensitive and she's ...
rare. She's just rare.''
</P>
<P>
   She might have left an indelible mark on her co-stars. Still,
Winfrey said, the movie was never really about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the spirit of the ancestors, literally, into
myself,'' said Winfrey, who read slave narratives and historical
accounts throughout filming and filled her trailer with some of the
authentic slave documents she has purchased from antiques dealers,
including one in Atlanta. ``I would light a candle and say their
names before every scene. `I'm doing this one for Little John _
(who was sold for) $350. For Isabella _ $400.' I never read a
newspaper in three months. I just surrounded myself with only
material from the period, to keep myself there. To keep myself
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days, suffice it to say, are over. Oprah _ make that
``Oprah!'' _ can't turn around right now without seeing herself
splashed all over the media. Nor, it seems, does she want to.
Winfrey has been to several cities talking up ``Beloved.'' In
Atlanta, a screening originally open to local media suddenly became
exclusive to Time magazine and its four-article package _ including
a cover hailing ``The Beloved Oprah'' _ in its Sept. 28 issue.
</P>
<P>
   That same issue of ``Time'' features an ``exclusive'' excerpt
from Winfrey's journal, ``Journey to Beloved,'' which will be
published in book form by Hyperion on Friday. That's the same day
that ``Beloved'' opens in theaters and when the subject of ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show'' will be _ what else? _ the cast and the story
of making ``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   If the synergy is breathtaking, so is the level of control.
Winfrey can be interviewed for this article but not photographed.
The article shouldn't run on wire services, where other news
outlets might pick it up. Cohen eventually agrees to speak with a
reporter about the re-enactment but first he speaks with Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's standard procedure. Well-known Atlanta writer Pearl
Cleage, for instance, has always been accessible to the media and
has written book reviews and opinion columns for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and been quoted frequently in articles on
everything from the importance of keeping a journal to the look of
the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cleage's debut novel, ``What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary
Day'' is the next reading selection of ``Oprah's Book Club'' _
something that has meant instant best-seller status and
unparalleled career boosts for Wally Lamb, Jacquelyn Mitchard and
others. Now when Cleage answers her phone, she points reporters
requesting an interview toward Harpo Productions, Winfrey's
production company, where publicists want to know when the article
will run, whether it will include photographs and the like.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might see ``Beloved'' as the next, logical step in
Winfrey's assault of all media: Having conquered TV and books, the
thinking goes, movies are the next logical step. Or maybe, with
Jerry Springer breathing down her Nielsen neck (his trash talk show
actually has higher ratings in Atlanta), she's just hedging her
bets by building an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic gets nowhere with Winfrey. For one thing, she said,
``Beloved'' could result in her doing less acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that this would make me get the acting bug,'' said
Winfrey, admitting her surprise. ``But it was so different than
acting that I came away thinking that I really only want to do
what's meaningful to me. I really don't want to just act.''
</P>
<P>
   For another, ``Beloved'' seems less a career move than a state
of mind where Winfrey is concerned. Just as the movie ends on a
slightly more optimistic note than the book, Winfrey seems more at
peace than ever _ with herself, with her decision to continue
hosting her talk show at least through the 2001-02 season and with
her increasing focus on positive, life-enhancing and spiritually
nourishing topics.
</P>
<P>
   Even, unbelievable as it seems, with Springer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I was encouraged by Jerry Springer,'' she said. ``I
never have spoken to him, but when I saw how absolutely bipolar we
were and that he is sort of going all the way out there, you know,
with people picking up chairs. ... The degree of his vulgarity
encouraged me to move in the opposite direction in the same kind of
force and power.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Cohen pointed out, Winfrey doesn't just move herself. She
moves countless others, as well, many of whom may discover inner
strength or talents they never knew they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's at a place in her evolution that a lot of the
world would like to be,'' said Cohen, 34, who appeared on Winfrey's
show in 1996 to discuss his two-month, 1,200-mile retracing by foot
of the Underground Railroad. ``She has so many things she can give
just by being herself, and it's things people need. I think we all
want to be better, to experience life to the fullest, and I think
we can vicariously do it through her.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cohen even surprised himself by managing to pull
together (with the help of the Maryland National Park and Planning
Commission) the entire re-enactment experience within just eight
days of being contacted by Harpo Productions. Told Winfrey wanted
him to take her out on the Underground Railroad, Cohen said, he
created a scenario in which she was a once-free black woman,
captured and sold into slavery. Placed on a plantation (actually,
an old Quaker community in Montgomery County, Md.), Winfrey was
surrounded by actors playing everyone from slaves to the overseer _
and left to figure things out for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll meet a number of people _ some black, some white, some
friends and some enemies,'' Winfrey was told by Cohen, who's
filming a documentary about a second trek he's making and whose
book, ``The Underground Railroad: A Personal Journey'' is due in
February. ``You won't know who is who and you'll have to decide who
to trust in order to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six hours, Winfrey worked in the field, saw
another slave being sold off the plantation, dealt with the cruel
overseer and _ finally _ escaped along with several others.
Following a poor white woman whose name they never learned, they
forded creeks, fields and swampy areas before finally reaching the
first safe house. After hiding while the local ``sheriff'' searched
the premises, Winfrey was dressed in Quaker clothes to continue on
the next step of a journey Cohen had planned to last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah essentially collapsed,'' recalled Cohen, who was
surprised at how mentally drained he was by that point as well.
``Not physically, but she was emotionally wrecked. She basically
said, `I want to go on, but I don't know if I can. This is too
real. This has brought up too much for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Winfrey had to start filming in two days, Cohen ended
the re-enactment before ever getting to some of the more dramatic
developments _ including smuggling her in a crate on the back of a
mule wagon and hiding her in a barn that would be circled by
bloodhounds _ with no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah is probably the one person in the world who, if she does
a role like this, can get across to people exactly what that
experience would have been like,'' said Cohen, who later received
what he'll describe only as a ``generous'' check from Winfrey, that
he used to buy a 40-volume series of slave narratives for a library
he's planning as part of his nonprofit North Star Foundation to
restore Underground Railroad safe houses. ``We were like, `Wow, the
chance to work with Oprah, the chance to help her help people learn
what that would have been like, is phenomenal.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was just to wear her out,'' Cohen concluded with a
chuckle. ``I guess it only took six hours instead of 48.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is Oprah, after all.

 &HT;    `Lear,' `Crime' present matchup of crazy men
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday night, if you can tear yourself away from the peanuts
'n' Crackerjack appeal of Game 4 in the Braves vs. Padres series,
there's a showdown that sounds more like a Great Books seminar than
a night of television: Dostoevski's ``Crime and Punishment'' vs.
Shakespeare's ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Match of the Crazy-Man Classics. In this corner,
wearing grimy black clothes and a scraggly beard and wielding an
axe, Raskolnikov, the tortured student who murders a pawnbroker. In
the other corner, wearing a battered crown and a haunted 100-yard
stare, Lear, the mad monarch who divvies up his kingdom
prematurely, and suffers greatly for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lear,'' starring Ian Holm, is the season premiere of
``Masterpiece Theatre'' (PBS-check local listings), from which we
expect such challenging works. But ``Crime and Punishment'' (9 p.m.
EDT Sunday on NBC) is from the same network that brings you
``Suddenly Susan'' every week, and is part of NBC's experiment in
classing up its act a little: First ``Gulliver's Travels,'' then
``The Odyssey,'' and next up, a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's
``The Tempest'' on Nov. 27. Next thing you know, Joey and Chandler
will be debating Kierkegaard and ignoring the ugly naked guy.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Gulliver'' and ``Odyssey,'' ``C&AMP;P'' was made by Robert
Halmi, the Hungarian showman-producer. Shot on location in Budapest
(standing in for 19th century St. Petersburg), it's a surprisingly
faithful adaptation of Dostoevski's great novel that is also, not
surprisingly, unable to capture the novel's richness. It stars
Patrick Dempsey (``JFK: Reckless Youth'') as the guilt-ridden
Raskolnikov, Ben Kingsley as his persecutor, Magistrate Porfiry,
and Julie Delpy (``An American Werewolf in Paris'') as Sonya, the
good-hearted prostitute (she's straight out of Dostoevski, not a TV
invention) who's finally Raskolnikov's redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime and Punishment'' moves too fast at first, as if afraid
viewers will click away. When it finally settles down, it tries
mightily to capture the dementia of Raskolnikov's interior
monologues as his guilt binds him to Kingsley's pursuit, but
succeeds only partly. In the end, it's a Classics Illustrated comic
come to life, a better expenditure of your time than most TV
movies, but still a pale shadow of the book.
</P>
<P>
   If the rhythm of ``Crime and Punishment'' seems frazzled at
times, the camera movement in ``King Lear'' is almost nonexistent.
If this BBC TV adaptation of Britain's Royal National Theatre
production were any more visually minimalist, it would be radio.
Sets are stark, sometimes barren, and costumes nondescript and
utilitarian, which puts all the emphasis on the faces and the
language.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Sir Ian Holm (``Chariots of Fire'') is at a great age to
play a great Lear: old enough to convince, robust enough to handle
the physical demands. (Unlike the London stage version, he does not
strip himself naked in the storm for TV.) His king is a seething,
sputtering Lear, and although he commands the stage, the supporting
cast is so deep and strong that ``Lear'' works even when Holm is
off.
</P>
<P>
   The play's most memorable scenes _ the chaos and dehumanization
of the storm scene, the blinding of Gloucester _ are almost
unbearable to watch.
</P>
<P>
   If, God forbid, the Braves are too far down to come back in
Sunday night's game, and it's a more refined agony you seek, turn
to the granddaddy of all pain, ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   Grades: ``Lear'': A
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime'': B-
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Halloween treat
</P>
<P>
   Those who really know their monster movies may not be blown away
by the new documentary ``Universal Horror'' (8 EDT tonight on
Turner Classic Movies).
</P>
<P>
   It's too geared to a less savvy audience, people who don't
already know that a Spanish-language ``Dracula'' was filmed
concurrently, at night, on the same sets used by Bela Lugosi for
his ``Dracula.'' However, they'll still appreciate the huge
collection of clips and the astute commentary by such well-versed
horror experts as Ray Bradbury and David Skal.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Kevin Brownlow and narrated by Kenneth Branagh (two
more classy choices), the special spotlights Universal during the
'30s and '40s when the studio imprinted its images of
Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, The Mummy and The Wolf Man on the
national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   As Skal points out, ``Ask somebody to draw a picture of
Frankenstein, they draw a picture of Boris Karloff. Ask any
8-year-old to talk like Dracula, they talk like Bela Lugosi.''
</P>
<P>
   The program strives to be all-inclusive in its delineation of
the history and impact of the horror movie. The good news is, it
includes such greats as James Whale. The bad news is, well, it
cheats. Long sections are devoted to horror classics like, say,
``King Kong.'' A classic, yes. But one made by RKO. Sometimes,
Universal's archives seem less important than Ted Turner's.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, ``Universal Horror'' is a Halloween treat for both
buffs and neophytes.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

GAY GROUPS SQUARE OFF WITH RELIGIOUS RIGHT OVER TV ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new TV ad campaign that says gays and lesbians
can change their sexual orientation through Christian faith touched
off another battle between gay rights groups and religious
conservatives Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives held a news conference to display two
60-second commercials for which they plan to buy air time at
broadcast outlets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, similar to full-page ads that the groups began
running in newspapers this summer, depict men and women who say
they were formerly homosexual and that through Christianity they
now live as heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are sponsored by the conservative Family Research
Council, the Concerned Women for America, the Center for Reclaiming
America and several ministerial groups that seek to alter the
behavior of gays.
</P>
<P>
   In one ad a man says, ``The dream that I thought could never
happen, having a wife and kids, has finally come true.'' At the end
of the ad, seven people who say they had been gay proclaim in
unison that ``we are living proof'' that Christianity can change
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   In the other ad the mother of a former homosexual says, ``Just
because you love your children, it doesn't mean you approve of
everything they do. Sometimes they make bad choices.'' She advises
parents to let such youngsters know ``that there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ads end with the words, ``It's not about hate. It's about
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a later news conference, gay rights activists argued that
hate is at the core of the new TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Garry, executive director of the New York-based Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said the ad sponsors ``are
showing their hand to the entire country and their message isn't
really about `hope' or `healing' or `understanding,' but rather
about intolerance, deception and moral bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Besen, associate director at the Washington, D.C.-based
Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian
political organization, said the ads were part of a
``misinformation campaign by the far right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conversion therapy is a kind of snake oil for the soul,''
added Elizabeth Birch, HRC executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Garry said she was asking television stations not to run the
ads, which also were denounced by Candace Gingrich, a lesbian
activist and House Speaker Newt Gingrich's half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin Ryan, author of a book called ``Lesbian and Gay Youth:
Care and Counseling,'' said that religious immersion won't ``cure''
homosexuals. ``There is no evidence conversion therapy works,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical groups have said that attempts to change an
individual's sexual orientation may do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the American Academy of Pediatrics reported that
``therapy directed at specifically changing sexual orientation ...
can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little potential for
achieving changes in orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the American Psychiatric Association said that ``any
person who seeks conversion therapy may be doing so because of
social bias that has resulted in internalized homophobia.'' It also
said that ``gay men and lesbians who have accepted their sexual
orientation positively are better adjusted than those who have not
done so.''
</P>
<P>
   At their news conference, the conservative groups introduced
people who said Christianity had helped them change their
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Cantu, a policy analyst with the Family Research Council,
said she had been a lesbian but found the lifestyle unfulfilling.
``Fortunately, I met people who were not afraid to tell me the
truth about my lifestyle, not only about its damaging effects, but
that I could be free from it,'' Cantu said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnston, president of Kerrusso Ministries in Newport
News, Va., said he renounced homosexuality nearly 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Changing one's orientation ``is not something that happens over
night,'' Johnston said. Success is when ``God gives you the
strength not to act on destructive desires.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the gay groups' news conference, three gay men and a
lesbian said they had tried unsuccessfully to become heterosexual
through years of Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Smith, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., said that after six
years of trying to change, ``the truth is that I am still gay. God
made me this way. You can't change who God made you to be.'
</P>
<P>
   Birch said the Human Rights Campaign rejects claims by the
religious groups that ``thousands'' of men and women have become
heterosexual through Christianity. She said the HRC will begin
investigating such claims.

   CLINTON-IMPEACH (Washington) _ Ledeall: The House debates and
then votes to open an inquiry into the impeachment of President
Clinton. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis: For all the talk
of duty and Constitution Thursday, it was not all that difficult
for the House to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton. The more troublesome question is how Congress will bring
to a conclusion the impeachment process that Rep. Henry Hyde called
``this venture, this excursion, this journey.'' By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBRIGHT (London) _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
confers on Kosovo with the NATO allies in Brussels, dispatches
envoy Holbrooke back to Belgrade, then meets with Contact Group
(including Russia) in London. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-KOREA (Tokyo) _ With the South Korean president in Tokyo,
Japan makes its first written government apology for its actions
during the 1910-45 colonial-era in Korea. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CONFIRM (Washington) _ As it prepares to adjourn for
the rest of the year, the Senate has not yet acted on dozens of
nominees approved by its committees, including the proposed
commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   HARE-KRISHNA-ABUSE (Undated) _ In its own official journal, the
Hare Krishna movement has published an unusually candid expose
detailing widespread physical, emotional and sexual abuse of
children who were sent to live in the group's boarding schools so
that their parents could travel around soliciting donations for
their guru's books in airports and on the streets. The Hare Krishna
movement is now openly acknowledging that the legacy of abuse has
led many Hare Krishna children and their parents in this country to
abandon the faith. By Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ For six weeks, investors have lulled
themselves into thinking that the worst was over, that the selloff
that had wracked financial markets around the world had largely run
its course. That notion was shattered Thursday as stock prices
plunged and the strong dollar fractured. By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   NOBEL-LITERATURE (Paris) _ Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old
Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life
and whose richly novels soon won him a following of loyal readers
across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded
this year's Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy in
Stockholm. By Alan Riding.

NEW JOINT VENTURE UNITES PHILLIPS AND ULTRAMAR DIAMOND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Texas)  (js) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp.
agreed Thursday to combine their gas station chains and refineries
into a joint-venture company called Diamond 66.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to save more than $250 million a year,
starting in the second year, and will eliminate 1,000 jobs from the
companies' combined work force of 29,000. Diamond 66 is expected to
have revenues of $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, based in San Antonio, will own 55
percent and Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., will own 45
percent of Diamond 66. Phillips will receive a cash payment of $500
million when the deal is closed and another $300 million one year
later.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond 66 will run 10 refineries and have more than 12,000 gas
stations in 36 states, mostly in the Southwest, Midwest, the West
Coast and six Canadian provinces. It will account for about 9
percent of the nation's gasoline market and be the nation's largest
independent refiner.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Allen, the chairman and chief executive of Phillips, said
the deal had been in the works for some time as his company sought
greater efficiency in refining.
</P>
<P>
   Recent mergers and joint ventures are putting pressure on the
smaller and less efficient refiners.
</P>
<P>
   For years the refining industry has been plagued by
overcapacity, but that has changed greatly recently. For most of
this year, refineries have run at full capacity to meet the strong
demand for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Refiners have also improved their profitability. For a while
this year, they benefited as crude oil prices dropped, while the
fall in prices of retail gasoline was less rapid.
</P>
<P>
   Ultramar Diamond Shamrock was formed in 1996 from the merger of
two refining companies, in a move to cut costs and increase
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Phillips closed at $45.375 Thursday, down $1.25, while
Ultramar rose 31.25 cents, to $23, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As have most of the medium-sized oil companies, Phillips has
been seeking to find a way to enter the race to develop the huge
fields in the Caspian Sea region and in Russia, projects that will
require huge spending. Last month Phillips joined with Inpex of
Japan in paying $500 million to the government of Kazakhstan for
drilling rights in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when Shell, Texaco and Aramco of Saudi Arabia
merged their refining and marketing operations on the East Coast of
the United States, Shell and Texaco also merged their West Coast
refining business. The two alliances now hold about 14 percent of
the nation's gasoline market.

 &HT;    Peruvian artifacts returned after 3 years
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A breathtaking collection of pre-Columbian artifacts,
smuggled out of Peru three years ago and seized by Customs agents
in Miami, were returned Thursday to the Peruvian government _ the
latest in a series of moves by U.S. authorities aimed at curbing
the growing international traffic in illicit artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 200 artifacts, incuding parts of human mummies,
gold icons, feathered headdresses and 1,000-year-old cotton
textiles were looted from at least a half-dozen archaeological
sites in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, which was being shipped through Miami to an
antiquities broker in Switzerland, represents the largest seizure
of pre-Columbian materials ever in the Southeastern United States.
Although the museum-quality pieces are considered priceless by
archaeologists, the street value of the items is estimated at more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``International traffic in items like this now ranks behind only
the smuggling of narcotics and arms,'' Deputy U.S. Attorney Carol
DiBattiste said at formal ceremonies returning the items to the
Peruvian government. ``We hope this sends a message to those who
might be tempted to engage in this illegal trade in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Customs officials acknowledge, however, that the seizure of
artifacts was largely a matter of luck. Customs agents in Miami
were actually looking for illegal drugs in February 1995 when they
searched a 4-foot-high packing crate labeled ``Peruvian
handicrafts'' _ declared value of $2,764 _ on the tarmac at Miami
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crate, shipped from Lima, Peru, was being transferred to a
holding area for a later flight to Switzerland, when agents pried
the lid open and found box after box of carefully packed artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky in two respects,'' said Customs inspector Wayne
Russell. ``Ordinarily, when we look for drugs, we start breaking
things open to see what's inside them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of Peruvian archaeologists, authorities eventually
identified material taken from sites representing at least seven
prehistoric Peruvian cultures, some of them dating back to 200 B.C.
A half-dozen items were looted from one of Peru's first
archaeological sites, the royal tombs of Sipan, more than a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been less fortunate in their efforts to track
down the people behind the smuggling opeation. Peruvian police have
been looking for more than a year for the man who shipped the
crate. And Swiss police investigated the art broker to which the
crate was being shipped, but declined to take further action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Peruvian Counsel General Carlos Cornejo,
noting that Peru's cultural heritage is being spirited out of the
country at an alarming rate, praised the efforts of Customs agents
for the return of the ``truly magnificent'' items representing some
of Peru's earliest cultures.
</P>
<P>
   By international agreement, the United States is obligated to
return all Peruvian artifacts it seizes, but 40 choice pieces will
remain temporarily in the United States to be exhibited at the
Florida International Museum's exhibit on Peru's prehistoric
cultures, which opens in St. Petersburg on October 23. It's an
unexpected addition to the exhibit that museum officials say they
hope will dramatize the illicit traffic in artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami seizure is the second high-profile case involving
smuggled Peruvian artifacts this year. In July, U.S. authorities
returned an 1,800-year old gold armor plate, valued at $1.6
million, that had also been looted from the tombs of Sipan.
</P>
<P>
   Two Miami men pled guilty to smuggling charges after an FBI
``sting'' operation caught them trying to sell the gold plate in a
hotel parking lot in downtown Philadelphia. A Panamanian diplomat,
who the FBI says smuggled the piece into the United States via
diplomatic pouch, has been indicted, but has never arrested.

GLENN SAYS HE'S BACK INTO SPACE AS A SCIENCE PASSENGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Sen. John Glenn took issue Thursday with
those who have questioned NASA's decision to include the
77-year-old former Mercury astronaut as a member of its next space
shuttle crew.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is one of seven astronauts in training at the Kennedy
Space Center this week for the countdown and lift off of the
shuttle Discovery on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   When the nine-day science mission launches, Glenn will become
the oldest human to fly in space, eclipsing the milestone
established in 1996 by Story Musgrave, who flew his sixth shuttle
mission at age 61.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave retired in 1997 after three decades in NASA's astronaut
corps when managers told him not to expect future missions. Earlier
this month, he characterized Glenn as a ``legislative passenger''
on the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just disagree entirely with that statement,'' Glenn said at
Discovery's launching pad. ``I'm not back as a legislative
passenger. I'm back as a science passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the basis on which I was selected and the basis on
which I have trained,'' Glenn said. ``If there are others who have
a different view of that, well, I just ask them to look at what
we've been doing and look at the experiments in detail.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to his hometown newspaper in Lexington, Ky., earlier
this month, Musgrave said that Glenn had taken a ``part-time''
approach to space. ``My record is: I cared about space enough to do
it for 30 years. I did not leave for greener pastures, then come
back as a passenger.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962,
says he left NASA three years later because the Kennedy
administration did not wish to risk the loss of a historical figure
as it raced the former Soviet Union to the moon. This year, he will
retire from the U.S. Senate after four terms.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also chastised the news media on Thursday, saying it is
too focused on his participation on the upcoming shuttle flight at
the expense of the scientific research that is planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to report on the personal aspects of this thing, but
this is science at its very best, out there on the cutting edge,''
Glenn said. ``I'd invite you to get out there and report some of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew plans 83 different experiments over its nine
days in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was named to the crew in January and will participate in a
range of research projects intended to reveal whether there are
similarities between the physical stresses of spaceflight and
aging. They include bone and muscle tissue losses, difficulty
sleeping and degradation of the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments will look at changes in plant germination in
the absence of gravity and the potential exploitation of
weightlessness for the production of anti-cancer and anti-viral
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite called Spartan the crew plans to deploy and retrieve
will also study subtle changes in the sun that influence the
Earth's climate.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery commander Curt Brown's crew arrived here Tuesday night
for three days of training. For the first two days, the shuttle
crew has rehearsed the procedures they would follow to escape the
launch pad if an emergency erupted while they were waiting to lift
off.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they plan to don the pressure suits they will wear
for their lift off Oct. 29 and board the shuttle Discovery to
rehearse the final hours of their countdown. The exercise is
conducted prior to every shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat this just like it's a launch,'' said NASA's Steve
Altemus, who supervises countdown activities here. ``We are all
kind of excited, at least me personally, with the opportunity to
launch a national hero, a space pioneer.'' &QL;

MEXICAN OFFICIAL CALLS FOR END TO STRICT RE-ELECTION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The newly installed governor of Zacatecas called
Thursday for the abolition of one of Mexico's most sacred
doctrines: that top officeholders, beginning with the president,
may not run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ricardo Monreal Avila also said that politics in Mexican is
changing rapidly and that voters are more likely to make ballot
decisions based on the candidate rather than the political party.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trend enabled Monreal to bolt the long-dominant
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) this spring and run on the
ticket of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) before
he actually joined the party.
</P>
<P>
   Monreal, who took office in the central state of Zacatecas on
Sept. 12, told foreign correspondents at a wide-ranging breakfast
meeting in Mexico City that he formally enrolled in the party only
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we must eliminate the anti-re-election clause
from the Mexican Constitution,'' Monreal said. ``That principle
comes from the days of the Porfiriato and has no place in modern
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The Porfiriato is the popular reference to the 40-year rule of
Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz, whose ouster in 1911 sparked the
nearly 20 years of killing and political turmoil known as the
Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, mayors, local and federal deputies may
serve more than one three-year term _ but not consecutively.
Governors, federal senators and the president serve six-year terms
and may not be re-elected to the same post.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts are now calling for an end to the
doctrine, arguing that it actually works against the democracy it
was meant to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Monreal said that the changeover should be phased in slowly,
beginning with the federal Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think that the term for mayors should be lengthened to
four years,'' he said. ``As it is now, a mayor no sooner begins
working than his term expires, and the next person comes in to
dismantle what the former began.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRD is developing the election strategy that made Monreal,
once a popular PRI national deputy, the party's first elected
governor.
</P>
<P>
   After a falling out with PRI leaders over who would head the
party's ticket in the Zacatecas elections, Monreal resigned and
became the PRD's ``external candidate,'' pledged to the party
platform without actually being a member.

EMERGENCY SPECIALISTS INSPECT FLOOD-RAVAGED AREAS IN KANSAS AND
MISSOURI TO ASSESS WHETHER FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF IS WARRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Six teams of emergency specialists inspected
flood-ravaged areas in Kansas and Missouri on Wednesday to assess
whether damage from Sunday's deluge warrants federal disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
   It then will be up to the governors of Kansas and Missouri to
ask President Clinton for a declaration of emergency to provide
federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   A federal emergency declaration would provide loans and grants
for homeowners, renters and businesses as well as temporary housing
assistance. Other programs may become available depending on the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Federal emergency management officials could not say how long it
would take for them to inspect eight counties in Missouri and four
counties in Kansas. But Warren Pugh Jr., a regional director for
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said action was possible
as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If a disaster is declared, officials will publicize a toll-free
number where people can get information about all relief programs
that are available.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration, which is participating in the
assessment, may offer low-interest loans to homeowners and
businesses independent of a federal emergency declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Both states and Kansas City already have declared emergencies
and the Red Cross is offering assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday one FEMA inspection team toured businesses on
Southwest Boulevard. Another walked through the Village Green
apartments on the north bank of Brush Creek and came up with a
preliminary count of 101 flood-damaged units.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors checked foundations for damage and noted the height
of water lines on the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're not seeing much, but with our experience we
know what damage we're looking at,'' said Tim Burke, a FEMA
investigator with 24 years' experience in disaster evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors spoke with relatively few individuals, but they could
see evidence of their plight in the piles of flood debris outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Village Green residents Felicia Smith and Leona Stewart both had
applied to the Red Cross for lodging assistance on Tuesday, but
were told someone first needed to look at their damaged apartments.
</P>
<P>
   They were still waiting on Wednesday when they spoke with Chuck
May of the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency, who was part
of the FEMA team. May took their names and numbers and promised to
follow up with the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has had to move her three children to a motel. Stewart
located temporary shelter but could stay only three days.
</P>
<P>
   Another Village Green resident, Phillip Binns, said he believes
state officials should ask for federal help. Binns also would like
the Army National Guard to help in the search for missing victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are some of our loved ones and friends floating around
out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri governor or lieutenant governor has authority to
call out the Guard without a federal emergency declaration, but
state officials said that is a last resort because most Guard
members have other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some communities wanted the Guard to come in to help with
debris removal, but the Department of Transportation said they
could do that,'' said Susie Stonner, spokeswoman for the Missouri
State Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Stonner added that the Missouri Water Patrol and the Highway
Patrol are assisting in the search for missing persons.
</P>
<P>
   The federal and state assessment teams are inspecting sites in
Johnson, Wyandotte, Leavenworth and Douglas counties in Kansas. In
Missouri they are looking at sites in Jackson, Platte, Clay, Cass,
Lafayette, Carroll, Chariton and Saline counties.
</P>
<P>
   Teams first began inspecting the hardest-hit areas in Kansas
City and Kansas City, Kan. At least one team also planned to visit
Carrollton, Mo., which had up to 10 inches of rain Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials issued a reminder that flood insurance is
available for homeowners or renters in most area communities
through the National Flood Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   It is not necessary to live within a 100-year flood plain to
purchase flood insurance. People within a 100-year flood plain with
federally backed mortgages, however, are required to buy flood
insurance.

WOMAN WHO ESCAPED FROM PRISON IN 1976 WILL NOT BE SENT BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMYRA, Mo. _ In 1976 it took Sandra Blount only minutes to
escape from the jail in this small town. It took her until
Wednesday to be truly free.
</P>
<P>
   That is when a Circuit Court judge chose not to send the
Sedalia, Mo., woman back to jail. Blount, held on bad-check
charges, had escaped from jail because she was concerned about her
children. She had lived undetected until June.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert M. Clayton II on Wednesday sentenced Blount, 55, to
two years of unsupervised probation and 80 hours of community
service. The judge said two decades of guilt and fear had been
enough punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said you've probably been on a kind of probation for
the last 22 years,'' Clayton told Blount. ``I think there's
certainly some truth to that.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the sentence, Blount took off her glasses and let
the tears flow. She hugged her husband, Fred, and sobbed: ``It's
over; it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount had kept the escape a secret from her husband of 18
years. He found out in June when the FBI tracked Blount down and
police arrested her.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest shocked much of Sedalia, where Blount had developed a
network of friends. She was beloved at the Rest Haven nursing home,
where she worked as a cook. Her Husband was stunned, too.
</P>
<P>
   But he stuck by her. He drove six hours round-trip for half-hour
visits while she was in the Palmyra Jail. The couple went into debt
to pay Blount's bail and phone calls to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Often his support was silent _ on Wednesday, he lovingly rested
his hand on Blount's shoulder while she received last-minute
instructions from her attorney. The Blounts had always said their
marriage was ``for better or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship is a lot stronger than it's ever been,''
Blount said. ``It's always been strong, but now we don't have
anything to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton cited the support of Blount's family and friends as
reasons for the sentence. He also cited the ``most glowing report I
have ever seen,'' from a Sedalia parole officer who advised against
jail time.
</P>
<P>
   That report from Sandy Lefevers acknowledged that Blount showed
``poor judgment'' for not turning herself in. The report also noted
that Blount was ``remorseful and cooperative'' and had not received
even a speeding ticket since her escape.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said: ``Obviously you have been very successful in the
last 22 years and been a good citizen. I don't think putting you in
jail is going to deter anyone from trying to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in Sedalia thought Blount should have been sent back
to jail. In Palmyra, Marion County prosecutors had pursued the case
aggressively. Prosecutor Thomas Redington, however, did not argue
for jail time Wednesday. He declined to comment after the
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The Blounts are shaken but grateful they're still together.
Financial donations have helped them move into another home. They
plan to stay in Sedalia, and they look forward to recapturing their
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As Blount walked out, she said she realized that a painful
chapter of her life was ending. It was a chapter that began with a
rash decision by a scared woman in the jail down the street from
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can finally say that all this is over,'' Blount said.
``I don't know that I'll ever come back here again. But I have good
and bad memories. This is where it started, and this is where it
ended. It ended good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to try to get on with our lives,'' she said.
``It's time to move forward and stop looking back.''

FASTER PACE ON NATURAL GAS DEREGULATION IS URGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A top federal energy regulator has declared this
period the ``dog days'' of deregulation and is urging a much faster
pace to bring competition to the natural gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Hoecker, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, said progress in deregulating energy markets _ both gas
and electric _ had been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, we can't be altogether sanguine by our progress,''
Hoecker said earlier this week. ``But the competition genie is
clearly out of the bottle, and I believe there is no going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoecker spoke to more than 300 state regulators and utility
executives from around the country who met in Pittsburgh this week
to discuss whether to give natural gas customers more choice in
selecting a supplier for the fuel and how to do so. Advocates say
such moves could save consumers money.
</P>
<P>
   Hoecker told the conference, which ended Wednesday, that
bringing more competition to the natural gas industry was a chore
that regulators must complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly not for sissies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference focused on customer choice and other ways
utilities might better serve their customers. Several industry
officials said the issue of how to benefit consumers had received
new interest since a series earlier this year by The Kansas City
Star about the natural gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The series exposed the flaws,'' said Nicholas Bush, president
of the Natural Gas Supply Association, based in Washington.
``They're talking about these issues now.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-part series looked at deregulation of the natural gas
industry and how it has affected consumers. One conclusion was that
most utilities could do more to protect consumers from the sort of
gas price spikes that occurred two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the series looked at how the use of price indexes
magnified the spikes. Price indexes are compiled by trade
publications that ask buyers and sellers at what price they buy or
sell the fuel. The indexes are then used by buyers of natural gas,
including utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gorak, a Baltimore lawyer who was on a conference panel
discussing the volatility of natural gas prices, said the indexes
could explain at least some of the natural gas price swings.
</P>
<P>
   Reform may be on the way. Hoecker said his agency was working on
a plan to use the Internet for a daily auction to set costs for
transporting gas through interstate pipelines. One possibility is
that the Internet could eventually be used in a similar way to help
set a price for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly in the mix of things,'' Gorak said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state regulators, who have much of the responsibility
for deregulating local utilities, are looking at ways to reduce
price swings. One possibility is the use of options or other
financial instruments to put a limit on how much prices can
increase. Utilities in Missouri and Kansas and in about four other
states are doing that now.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the biggest issue at the energy conference was
customer choice, the name for giving consumers a choice of gas
suppliers. Supporters say such a plan can reduce gas bills 10
percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Others think, however, that going from a fully regulated
monopoly to a more freewheeling environment should be done with
extreme caution to ensure reliability of supply and avoid consumer
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gas Service, for example, is asking that the rules be
relaxed slightly to allow medium-size users to shop for gas. But in
Kansas and Missouri, smaller commercial and all residential
customers are still obligated to purchase gas from a utility.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy recently started a campaign with the
Consumer Energy Council to educate its customers on customer
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Crumpton, a commissioner with the Missouri Public Service
Commission, said the state would approach customer choice carefully
after looking at how other states fare.
</P>
<P>
   Many shared Crumpton's impulse to move slowly, questioning
whether potential savings have been overstated. Only about a
half-dozen states have deployed large-scale customer choice
programs for their residents, and several others have pilot
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Among states moving aggressively toward customer choice is Ohio,
where savings averaging 10 percent have been achieved for more than
70,000 consumers. John Partridge Jr., an executive with Columbia
Gas of Ohio, said consumer choice was viable.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, where the natural gas industry was founded more than
a century ago, recently started a consumer choice program, and city
officials said it was saving consumers money.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Laffer, the father of supply-side economics, weighed in
on the issue of deregulating natural gas during his keynote address
at the conference by warning not to phase it in but to deregulate
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it right,'' Laffer said. ``Do it now, bang.''

SOME THINGS DON'T NEED CHANGING, BUT REFORMERS, IMPROVERS ARE
EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: I was saddened to read a dispatch from France the other
day telling that Paris authorities next week will put in service a
new Metro line served by driverless trains traveling between
stations at twice the speed of trains on the older lines.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the New York or London subways, the Metro already is
a model of efficiency, and certainly of cleanliness. But in the way
of progress, I suppose it is only a matter of time before this new
means of moving passengers metastasizes throughout the whole Paris
network.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the 242 people needed to run a conventional line of
the same length, the announcement said, all 13 trains on the new
line can be operated by only four persons from a computerized
command post above one of the stations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman explained that Metro drivers no longer will be
cooped up alone in an operator's compartment. Instead, they will be
free to circulate on the platform and through the trains, mingling
with the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   This dismays me on a couple of counts.
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt for a moment those drivers are fine company and
splendid conversationalists, but when I lived in Paris I did not
take public transit in the hope of forming a social relationship
with a Metro employee.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, while redundant safeguards surely have been built
into the automated system, machines _ even computers _ have been
known to err.
</P>
<P>
   It always reassured me to know there was a living person sitting
right up front in the lead car, looking through the windshield with
something personally at stake if he happened to notice another
train's headlight approaching on the same track.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the station platform itself also will be
different. A plastic barrier will separate waiting riders from the
track, its doors sliding open to admit them when the train has
halted in place.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose is to prevent careless travelers from falling onto
the rails, or the melancholy and the deranged from deliberately
flinging themselves down into that deadly defile.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is very tidy, I suppose, but it does create a
problem for those Parisians yearning to divest themselves of the
burdens of this world.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since wire nets were placed just below the upper platforms
of the Eiffel Tower to catch jumpers, the Metro has been the
preferred method of public self-destruction. It is fast and, above
all, it is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the tower and the Metro track, and in a country where
the private ownership of guns is rare what's left? Poison
mushrooms, bad wine, tainted shellfishand of course the river _ the
ageless Seine, into whose cold embrace the desperate and the
lovelorn have been throwing themselves for as long as French poets
and novelists have been writing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's the news I got the other day from Paris. And by
and large, like the glass pyramid at the Louvre, the news was a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the obvious truth that some things in this world
don't need changing, the reformers and the improvers are
everywhere. The rest of us are just riders aboard a train without a
driver.

CONGRESSMEN PROTEST USE OF NAVY NAPALM TO BURN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH RENDON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of gallons of napalm processed at a Deer Park, Texas,
plant south of Houston are being used to burn hazardous materials
in Port Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas congressmen have sent letters to the U.S. Navy about
the incineration of the processed Vietnam-era napalm. They are
concerned because when the jellied gasoline was sent to Texas,
officials indicated it eventually be used as fuel for cement kilns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, about 5,000 gallons of the napalm _ blended with other
solvents at the GNI plant _ were sent by truck on Wednesday to the
Chemical Waste Management facility located about seven miles west
of Port Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   The burning using the recycled napalm, which has the consistency
of fuel oil, started Thursday morning and is expected to end
Friday. It is a considered a test burning.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Reeves, vice president of regulatory affairs for GNI, said
ChemWaste is using the napalm mixture as a fuel during its
incineration process. The plant, he said, has a rotating kiln for
burning solid hazardous materials. When the materials are burned,
there are gases that are not destroyed and require a second burn.
It is during the second burn, known as the after-burn, that the
napalm is being used, Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gary, manager of the Chem Waste plant, was out of the office
Thursday and could not be reached for comment. ChemWaste was one of
three Texas companies that were vying for the $9 million napalm
contract when it was awarded to GNI.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Chem Waste is not capable of burning all the napalm
that is recycled by GNI.
</P>
<P>
   The first 22,000-gallon shipment of napalm was sent by rail in
July to the GNI plant from the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Support
Facility in California.
</P>
<P>
   The detonators had been removed from the 3.4 million gallons of
napalm stored in canisters since the 1970s. The canisters, however,
started to leak and posed an environmental threat, which forced the
Navy to seek a disposal plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said GNI has not received any more of the jellied
gasoline since the initial shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor will we until we have firm contracts and consistent
outlets. As soon as that happens we'll start receiving again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said several companies, including cement kilns, are under
consideration for contract to receive the processed napalm. The
recycled napalm could be used in cement kilns as an alternative to
fossil fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anybody that I can name, but there are several
others that are under consideration for contract. I realize on the
surface it doesn't look like it's moving along very quickly but
under the surface there is a lot of activity going on and a lot of
people are looking at samples,'' Reeves said. ``Hopefully in the
few short weeks, sooner I hope, there will be more information
about other outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Yocum, spokesman for Columbus, Ohio-based Battelle
Memorial Institute, which holds the main napalm recycling contract,
said GNI has been unable to find a cement kiln that wants the
recycled napalm.
</P>
<P>
   Yocum said he thinks no cement kiln has agreed to take the
napalm because of the publicity surrounding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, it's been a very hot potato. That is my guess as
to why the cement kilns have backed away because it is an excellent
fuel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Reeves said no Texas company was being considered to
receive the recycled napalm.
</P>
<P>
   Texas congressmen Kent Bentsen and Gene Green, both Houston
Democrats, have sent letters to Navy Secretary John Dalton about
the incineration.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen told Dalton he was concerned the processed napalm would
be burned at Safety Clean (formerly Laidlaw) which is adjacent to
GNI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such action would be contrary to repeated assurances the Navy
has provided to the public, the city of Deer Park, the State of
Texas, and to me that the napalm would not be incinerated at this
facility,'' Bentsen wrote. ``It would severely undermine public
confidence in this project and the credibility of all involved and
raise significant new questions about public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said, however, ``There is no truth to the rumor that this
material is being shipped to Laidlaw for burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen wrote that the Navy had never mentioned the napalm being
used at hazardous waste facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Green wrote that the option of incineration as a proper method
for disposing of the napalm was never discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Pirie Jr., assistant secretary of the Navy, responded
to Green saying that since there were no contracts with cement
kilns, the napalm would be used as incinerator fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The napalm would be used in lieu of natural gas, or other new
fuels, to destroy hazardous wastes,'' he said. ``Although not our
first choice, and more expensive than the kiln option, using the
blended fuel as an alternative fuel for an incinerator meets our
goal of recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Arthur City Manager Steve Fitzgibbons said there have not
been any protests against the shipping of the napalm product to the
Chem Waste facility although many residents expressed concern when
an informational meeting was held earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Combs, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Beaumont,
whose district includes Port Arthur, said Lampson was disappointed
the recycled napalm was not being used at cement kilns, as
originally announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this is just a sample test and a small amount of the
product, he feels it is wise to see what this sample tells us and
then go from there,'' Combs said. &QL;

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Iran said Thursday that its troops had clashed
with Taliban forces along the Afghan border and inflicted heavy
casualties in a skirmish between neighbors who have been in a tense
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The reported fighting, which followed more than two months of
bellicose statements from both sides, would be the first between
Iran and the Taliban, whose rival interpretations of Islam have
contributed to open hostility.
</P>
<P>
   A Taliban spokesman, Wakil Ahmed, denied to an Afghan news
service that any conflict had taken place, and that Taliban forces
near the border had not to responded to what he said had been three
days of Iranian artillery fire. Ahmed said the report of a military
clash was ``propaganda against the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran, led by a Shiite Muslim government, has massed some 270,000
troops along the Afghan border after recent victories by the Sunni
Muslim Taliban, the militant Islamic movement that has gained
near-total control of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The main flashpoint in the crisis has been the killing in August
of at least eight Iranian diplomats based in Afghanistan. The
Taliban, who have acknowledged that their forces carried out the
slayings, have vowed to prosecute those responsible, but the Iran
has warned of possible military retaliation. Iranian President
Mohammed Khatami has said Iran will work through diplomatic
channels to settle its differences with the Taliban but is prepared
to use force if diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Thursday's reported clash, Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi said: ``We do not discount using military force to
fulfill our demands. There is a certain limit to our restraint with
the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's clash, reported by the official Iranian press, was
the first described by either side since the standoff began with
the Aug. 8 killings, and it raised the specter of broader fighting
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian account, broadcast on television and repeated by the
official government press agency, said three Taliban border posts
had been ``completely destroyed'' during three hours of fighting
that took place about 110 miles southeast of the Iranian city of
Mashaad.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted Brig. Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander of the ground
forces of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards, as saying that
his force stood ready to respond to any further ``provocations'' by
the Taliban, who he said had opened fire Thursday morning with
mortars and automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Jaafari said that the Taliban had been ``forced to retreat'' and
that the situation along the border was ``currently calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Abdolali Pourshasb, the commander of Iran's ground
forces, said in an Iranian television report Thursday that the
large Iranian force along the border was nearly ready to begin
major maneuvers for which preparations have been underway for
nearly a month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iran, a key backer of the Taliban's military opponents in
Afghanistan, has looked with misgivings on developments inside that
country ever since the militant Islamic militia took control of the
capital, Kabul. Faithful to Islam's minority Shiite wing, it has
accused the Taliban, who follow what they say is a purist version
of the dominant Sunni faith, of being embarrassments to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Like the United States and the United Nations, Iran still
recognizes the deposed government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani
as Afghanistan's legitimate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As the price for a possible settlement with the Taliban, Iran
has demanded a formal apology for the killing of the diplomats and
the release of some 40 Iranians still being detained. It has also
demanded that the Taliban surrender to international authorities
those responsible for the killings, and that it return to Iran the
bodies of the two diplomats not among those flown to Tehran last
month.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban has insisted on prosecuting the killers itself,
and it has said that any further goodwill gestures must be the
product of international mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' special envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar
Brahimi, an Algerian diplomat, is in the region in an effort to
resolve the crisis. Brahimi spent four days in Iran this week, and
is now in Pakistan for meetings with Pakistani and Taliban
officials. He said before leaving Iran that the killing of the
Iranian diplomats had created serious tensions and dangers for the
entire region.

CONSERVATION PROCEDURES AID BREAST RECON STRUCTION  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   UNDATED - Losing a breast to cancer is devastating. Some women
call it an amputation _ chilling words.
</P>
<P>
   But today's state-of-the-art techniques can reconstruct breasts
lost to cancer with amazing cosmetic results. Many surgeons are
using breast conservation procedures that cut away less in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Few radical mastectomies, in which the breast and considerable
tissue underneath the arm _ to eliminate involved lymph nodes _ are
removed, are performed today. Removal of tissue beyond the breast
causes significant pain and discomfort, often restricting a woman's
arm and shoulder movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the most persistent problems post-mastectomy,''
says Scottsdale, Ariz., surgeon Dr. Robin Staerkel.
</P>
<P>
   For patients who must have a mastectomy, the preferred operation
is the modified radical mastectomy, in which just a few nodes are
removed along with the breast. Surgeons no longer need to remove a
large wedge of the breast. Instead, they make an incision and scoop
out the tissue, while leaving most of the outer skin. This is
called ``skin sparing'' and makes reconstruction easier.
</P>
<P>
   Also common today is the lumpectomy, or breast conservation, in
which only the tumor and some lymph nodes are removed. Surgery is
followed by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown no difference in long-term survival rates
between mastectomy and lumpectomy where the latter is deemed
appropriate, says Dr. Barbara Pockaj (pronounced POCH-Kye), a
surgeon at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only about half of eligible women receive the more
conservative procedure, she says. Pockaj vigorously promotes
conservative techniques, believing they are just as successful and
enhance a woman's psychological outcome.
</P>
<P>
   When scarring can be kept to a minimum, she says, ``it's less of
a reminder when you wake up in the morning that you've had
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The new thinking, she says, is ``less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   Why don't more surgeons practice conservation?
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors who have been working in the field for many years
are comfortable with time-honored procedures, even though
statistics support newer methods, Pockaj says. Conservation surgery
is also more difficult to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors insist that taking the whole breast is the only
way to ensure there will be no recurrence of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are not good candidates for breast conservation
include those with multiple tumors, women with connective tissue
disease, and pregnant women who cannot undergo radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Age makes no difference, Pockaj says. She has performed
conservation surgery on an 87-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women are very happy with breast conservation,''
Pockaj says. ``The public demands it.''
</P>
<P>
   Removal of lymph nodes also has benefited from new technology.
Complications of extensive node removal include pain, swelling of
the arm, decreased range of motion and localized fluid retention.
Surgeons often feel most comfortable removing more nodes than will
prove ultimately necessary _ just to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a technique called sentinel lymph node biopsy can spare
women some discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering operation was discussed in a recent issue of the
``New England Journal of Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pockaj explains how the procedure works:
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before breast cancer surgery, the surgeon injects a
radioactive substance at four points around the tumor. After the
tumor has been removed, a blue dye is injected in the space left by
the tumor. Using a hand-held gamma ray counter and visual
observation of the trail of dye, surgeons can locate the ``hot
spot'' _ the lymph node that is first in line to absorb cancer
cells from the tumor. This is called the sentinel lymph node.
</P>
<P>
   That node and just a few others can be removed, reducing
devastation. Nodes removed are immediately examined for traces of
cancer. If tests are negative, no further action is taken. If tests
are positive, more nodes can be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Late this year, a study of the procedure will get under way,
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving about
4,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so remarkable,'' says Staerkel, the Scottsdale surgeon.
``It's very exciting to have that technology available.''
</P>
<P>
   Once cancer surgery has been completed, reconstruction of the
breast can begin. Results after a mastectomy can be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   One method used at the Mayo Clinic is called a ``tram'' flap and
uses tissue taken from the abdomen to rebuild the breast. A wedge
is removed from the abdomen and is burrowed underneath the skin up
to the breast. Blood supplies can be kept intact.
</P>
<P>
   Pockaj says the procedure works well, but it is not without
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Leighton, a Scottsdale plastic and reconstructive
surgeon, does not favor the tram flap procedure, believing it can
restrict movement in the majority of breast reconstruction cases. A
piece of mesh is inserted into the abdomen where the tissue has
been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Staerkel is also hesitant to recommend tram flaps, saying the
operation is a long one and that patients who are obese or who
smoke are not good candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Because a major artery maintains the blood supply to the tram
flap, smokers could find that artery soon clogged with plaque,
compromising its function. In obese women, there is an excess of
fat in the abdomen, and outcome of the operation can be poor.
</P>
<P>
   In all patients, removing part of the muscle and skin from the
abdomen can leave a weakened abdominal wall that could develop a
hernia, according to literature published by the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But Leighton says tram flaps have advantages. Because the
patient's own tissue is used to rebuild the breast, the patient
avoids complications of implants, including rupture, deflation and
hardening of the breast.
</P>
<P>
   He agrees patients do well over time.
</P>
<P>
   Tram flaps are especially appropriate after radiation, when the
skin has been rendered somewhat fibrous.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Leighton prefers using expanders to stretch the
skin of the breast, then inserting a saline (salt solution) or
silicone implant. Silicone, he believes, is not health-threatening
and proves softer and more natural feeling than saline.
</P>
<P>
   Expanders can be inserted under the muscle of the breast at the
time of surgery, giving the woman some sense of a breast when she
wakes up. A small valve allows the expander _ also called a saline
balloon _ to be filled at the rate of about two ounces of fluid
each week for two months.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the valve can be removed and the expander left
intact to serve as an implant. Or a new implant can replace the
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Staerkel likes the idea of inserting something into a woman's
chest at the time of breast cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women do wake up with a vision of themselves and not as
amputations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the breast contour has been restored, Leighton goes to work
creating a nipple.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small but important part of a woman's self-image,
Staerkel says. ``It's so devastating to lose a nipple.''
</P>
<P>
   Removing the nipple is unavoidable. As the hub of the milk
ducts, it always harbors cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   New nipples once were made from tissue from other parts of the
body _ the groin, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Leighton prefers using scar tissue from the mastectomy
incision, which is more erectile and makes a firmer and more
natural-looking nipple. Six weeks later, the patient returns to
have an areola _ the colored area encircling the nipple _ tattooed
on. Results can be remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are ``totally, 100 percent pleased,'' he says of
reconstructive work.
</P>
<P>
   Another technique now being used for breast reconstruction is
called a purse-string or drawstring incision. The surgeon excises
the nipple and areola with a circular cut and removes the entire
breast, saving the outer skin. The opening is closed in a
drawstring fashion. An implant then can be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   When the new nipple is created, it is attached over that
incision and virtually covers the scar.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton prides himself on other ways of hiding scars. Even when
the incision stretches across the breast, he gradually _ over
several years with more than one operation _ can move the scar down
until it is hidden underneath the breast.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton is sensitive to women's emotional needs after breast
cancer surgery, noting that patients need not only their breasts
repaired but also their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still devastated, they're still depressed,'' he says.
``Starting the reconstruction immediately really helps.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reducing risk &QL; 
Preventing breast cancer is difficult. A woman's greatest risk
factors are her gender and advancing age _ tough odds to beat.  &QL; 
Luckily, fewer patients are suffering advanced disease, thanks to
education and the more frequent use of mammograms. Mammograms,
which take X-ray pictures of the breast, can aid in early cancer
detection. &QL; 
Women ages 50 to 69 have a reduced death rate if they have an
annual mammogram. Women 40 to 49 also might have a lower death
rate, but the reduction is less. &QL; 
Dr. Barbara Pockaj, a surgeon with Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, offers
these tips to reduce the risk: &QL; 
- Follow a low-fat diet with plenty of vegetables, especially
broccoli and cauliflower. &QL; 
- Include soy products in your diet _ tofu, tofu cheese, soy milk. &QL; 
- Maintain proper weight without wide fluctuations. &QL; 
- Reduce alcohol consumption. Liquor may be good for the heart, but
it's bad for the breast. (Of course, the leading cause of death in
America is heart disease.) &QL; 
- Get plenty of exercise. &QL;

`MEASURE FOR MEASURE': TINKERING WITH THE BARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the privacy of his office, a powerful officeholder
asks an attractive young woman for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth does this sound so familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe because it sets in motion the strange events of
``Measure for Measure,'' Shakespeare's dark fable of lust and
punishment. The setting here, of course, is Vienna, not Washington,
and though Angelo, the sinning deputy, must account for his
indecent proposals in a humiliating public session, he's never
actually called upon outright to provide his own definition of
``sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as underscored in Target Margin Theater's radical
restaging of the play, the parallels to current events are
striking. ``Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite,'' Angelo (Andrew
Dolan) demands of Isabella (Sheri Graubert). In this instance,
however, it's a woman's refusal to submit that exposes a man to
accusations of corruption and abuse of power, charges that lead to
the kind of public act of contrition that might even satisfy the
table-pounding cadres of commentators on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``So deep sticks it in my penitent heart,'' Angelo declares at
the end, ``that I crave death more willingly than mercy.'' Now,
that's a mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   Target Margin, a 7-year-old Off Off Broadway company that runs
the classics through a postmodernist filter, has had considerable
success in recent years with reconsiderations of fascinating,
forgotten old plays like Julian Green's ``South'' and, especially,
Dorothy and DuBose Heyward's ``Mamba's Daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Guided by the director David Herskovits, the company has
developed a signature style, that is to say, a pastiche approach
that borrows from other theatrical traditions and cultures. Actors
stain and tattoo their faces, model costumes both modern and
classical, and declaim artificially, all flourishes intended to
redesign a play for the contemporary eye and ear.
</P>
<P>
   The conceits work wonderfully well in many instances,
particularly when Herskovits' embellishments underscore a society's
changing values, as in the homosexual undercurrents in ``South'' or
the subtleties of dialogue and race in ``Mamba's Daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Measure for Measure'' at the Cornelia Connelly Theater,
the director's tinkering affords fewer rewards. Perhaps it is the
company's unpleasant run-ins with Elizabethan language; aside from
Ms. Graubert, who is an immaculate and appealing Isabella, the
actors are not very successful with Shakespeare's verse. Since
Herskovits' twists and turns are so dependent on irony, a lack of
verbal dexterity imposes stringent limitations on what he is able
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenes _ as is often the case with this talented
director _ are the one-on-ones. Ms. Graubert and Dolan are well
matched in the juicy set-tos wherein Isabella rebuffs Angelo's
moves. There is, however, a lot of posing of groups of otherwise
uninvolved actors that confuses rather than embroiders the plot;
the production is affected and stagey, in a dilettantish way. It's
freshness without the flavor.
</P>

CONFLICT BETWEEN EUROPE'S POLITICIANS AND CENTRAL BANKERS GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As financial gloom grew across Europe
Thursday, political leaders were running into deepening conflicts
with European central banks over the best way to respond.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three months before 11 countries adopt the euro
as a new European currency, the bankers who govern the new European
Central Bank are holding to a conservative policy designed to
establish the euro's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But political leaders, particularly in Germany and France, have
begun bluntly attacking those policies and are pushing for easier
money as a way to spur economic growth and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has intensified in the last few days after the
Social Democratic Party's victory in German elections on Sept. 27.
While the U.S. Federal Reserve has begun to cut rates, many of
Europe's politically independent bankers have been reluctant to
follow suit, and politicians are beginning to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it wrong that the Bundesbank conducts its monetary
policy as if these problematic developments in global finance
weren't there,'' said Oskar Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social
Democratic Party who is expected to be named finance minister in
the new German government. ``It's not a holy institution with a
doctrine of papal infallibility.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, most central bankers are refusing to bend.
European currencies have surged against the dollar in recent days
after Hans Tietmeyer, the president of Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, made it clear on Wednesday that he would not cut rates
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure is increasing. European stock markets plunged
Thursday, largely on expectations that stronger European currencies
hurt exports and slow growth. In Germany, Europe's biggest economy
and heaviest exporter, the benchmark DAX index plunged 4.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of pressure, the Bank of England announced
Thursday that it would cut a key short-term interest rate by a
quarter-point, to 7.25 percent. For Britain, which has decided not
to join the European currency union and follows a separate monetary
policy, it was the first rate cut since June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In continental Europe, leaders are battling over fundamental
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   With the Social Democrats' victory, Europe's biggest countries
are or will soon be controlled by center-left governments. A
growing number of those governments now favor an easier monetary
policy and would like to exert more political control over the
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Lafontaine has been an adamant critic of hawkish
monetary policies. Representing the Social Democrats' orthodox left
wing, he has argued for years that such policies were the biggest
culprits behind the nation's high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   French political leaders share those views. Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin has long advocated lower interest rates to
spur job creation. He has also bristled at the political
independence given to the Bank of France and the new European
Central Bank, calling for stronger political controls.
</P>
<P>
   All of that runs counter to core principles of the European
Central Bank and of individual national banks. Because the euro
will have its debut in January, the central banks of each member
country have already locked their policies together into what
amounts to a single framework.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the new European Central Bank is allowed only to focus
on the question of price stability and inflation. Government
leaders are not allowed to interfere or to influence any of its
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is indeed very significant,'' said Thomas
Mayer, an economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt. ``We aren't
used to having a government trying to influence monetary policy. In
the strategy of the new German government, the role of monetary
policy is obviously to spur economic growth and the creation of
jobs. That is obviously an approach that the central bankers of the
European Central Bank do not share.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many economists argue that Europe is already following an
expansionary monetary policy and does not need to change course.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's basic short-term rate is 3.3 percent, and the average
rate across the 11 countries in the ``euro zone'' is 3.7 percent _
significantly lower than in the United States, where rates are more
than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tietmeyer and many private sector economists argue that
Europe is already loosening monetary policy as it prepares for the
euro. That is because countries with traditionally high interest
rates, like Spain and Italy, have to align their rates with those
of Germany and France before the debut of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most economists assumed that Germany would help
close the gap by nudging its rates upward. Instead, the central
bankers appear determined to keep their rates low and let the other
countries drop down to their level.
</P>
<P>
   Spain took just such a step this week, cutting its short-term
rate by a half-point, to 3.75 percent. Portugal, Italy and Ireland
are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the global financial turbulence, Dresdner Bank and many
other institutions still predict that European economic growth will
remain well above 2 percent next year and will exceed that of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the United States is likely to be more affected
by a slowdown in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central bankers are confident that monetary policy in
euroland is expansionary at the moment and will remain
expansionary,'' said Stefan Bergheim, an economist at Merrill Lynch
in Frankfurt. ``We don't need to be lectured by central bankers who
are running interest rates that are 20 percent higher than ours.''

IN HONG KONG, MCDONALD'S IS IN THE DOGHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In this status-obsessed city, where Rolls-Royces and
Rolexes seem to outnumber Toyotas and Timexes, the most prized of
all possessions these days is a 75-cent plastic beagle.
</P>
<P>
   Every day since Sept. 11, McDonald's has sold a new Snoopy
figure, dressed in different national costume, as part of a
monthlong marketing campaign. And with each day, the stampede to
buy these toys has gathered force _ turning a fad into a phenomenon
and, ultimately, into a public safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Hong Kong police had to break up scuffles among
tens of thousands of people who lined up _ many of them overnight _
in front of the city's 147 McDonald's restaurants to buy the ``Hong
Kong'' Snoopy, a sturdy little fisherman clad in a yellow rain
slicker and holding his daily catch.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Hong Kong's legislature demanded that the restaurant
chain halt the promotion because it was provoking unruly scenes
outside the restaurants. McDonald's has recently tried to defuse
the criticism by allowing customers to order an unlimited number of
Snoopy toys through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have just gone crazy,'' a well-dressed woman said as
she waited restlessly outside a McDonald's, alongside stockbrokers,
department-store clerks, household servants, college students and
even some children.
</P>
<P>
   So pervasive is beagle-mania here that it has managed to
trivialize even the most solemn of civic rituals. When Hong Kong
celebrated China's National Day last week, there was more talk
about the Golden Arches, where crowds flocked to buy the ``China''
Snoopy, than about the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where Mao proclaimed
the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Fads are nothing new in Hong Kong, where the crowded living
conditions and a gregarious population make it a hothouse for all
sorts of trends. But the scale and nature of this fad has caught
social observers by surprise. For one thing, people here normally
pitch their consumer obsessions a bit higher.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, for example, Hong Kong people lined up by the
thousands to buy shares in ``red chips,'' mainland Chinese-owned
companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. And in the fall,
they besieged a fancy cake shop, after rumors circulated that it
was about to close. Never, though, have so many upscale consumers
turned cartwheels over something so resolutely mass market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm baffled,'' said Michael Bond, a professor of
psychology at Chinese University in Hong Kong. ``The texture of
these Snoopy toys isn't particularly appealing, the shape isn't
particularly appealing. I guess nobody ever went broke
underestimating the taste of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the Snoopy craze is merely the latest sign of Asia's
economic distress. At a time when the recession has hammered Hong
Kong's stock market, property market and even its race track, these
brightly colored, three-inch beagles have become a low-cost outlet
for people's consumer appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Snoopy costs very little, but it represents something _ a
status symbol,'' said Peter Tsoi, a local psychiatrist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But economic misery alone does not explain it. Mcdonald's has
run the same campaign in Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore, where it
was popular but scarcely a sensation. The company said it would
start the campaign in Japan soon and was considering whether to
bring it to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Demand here is so intense that it has spawned a lively black
market. Dealers loitered outside a McDonald's in central Hong Kong
on a recent morning, haggling over particularly coveted Snoopys,
like the ones representing China, Britain and the United States.
The most sought-after Snoopy _ a sombrero-wearing Mexican _
commands nearly $40 at markets in the teeming neighborhood of
Mongkok.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever people can smell a black market, they will come out
in droves,'' said Thomas Wong, a 36-year-old employee at a finance
company, who stood in line with his wife. ``That is especially true
during a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his financial bent, Wong insisted he was collecting the
Snoopy toys purely for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he doubted that the figures would have enduring
value once the promotion ended on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the growing black market has exposed McDonald's to
criticism. The company has declined to say how many Snoopys it has
sold or how many it has in stock, which has further inflated their
perceived value.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, when mail-in orders for the Snoopys were
announced, customers could only buy a single toy by lining up to
purchase a burger, french fries and a soft drink. But because they
could also buy up to five meals at a time, many were emerging from
McDonald's laden down with plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want long lines,'' said Mayee Tang, a spokeswoman for
McDonald's. ``People are lining up overnight. We're very concerned
about safety in our restaurants. People are also really
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those lining up on a recent morning, however, the mood was
more sheepish than surly. A well-dressed young man reading The
Asian Wall Street Journal waved away a reporter without lifting his
eyes from the paper. Several people argued that Snoopy offered
valuable lessons about other cultures. And still others insisted
they were only buying them for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't reflect the craziness of Chinese people, but the
desire of parents to satisfy their kids,'' said a woman who
identified herself only as Mrs. Tam, and was on her 10th
consecutive day of lining up to buy a beagle.

CONGRESS, WHITE HOUSE WORK LATE INTO NIGHT HOPING TO STRIKE
SPENDING DEAL 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an eye on the clock, congressional and White
House negotiators met late into the night Thursday hoping to strike
a deal on a spending package that would avert an election-year
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   But while both sides continued to talk compromise, lawmakers
were busy preparing a temporary spending measure that would keep
federal agencies operating past midnight Friday when another
stopgap funding bill expires.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Republican leaders said they were prepared
to drop some of their policy demands in order to reach basic
spending agreements on the remaining appropriations bills for the
1999 fiscal year. But it seemed clear that no deal would be reached
before Congress' scheduled adjournment deadline of Friday, and
members resolved to work through the weekend to finish up their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to smooth over differences with the White House so he can
send members home to campaign for re-election, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., advised Republicans to abandon any
policy positions that turn out to be obstacles to reaching final
agreements with the president and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a money agreement, if there is a policy dispute,
pitch it,'' Lott said he told his negotiators. ``There will be
people back here next year who can fight policy battles.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton met with his budget team to review
the progress made thus far in negotiations with the Republicans.
Facing an impeachment inquiry, he said ``the most important thing''
he could do now was ``to work in the next few days to cross party
lines'' in hopes of reaching a compromise spending agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he intends to stick to some of his priorities,
especially on education and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to pass a budget that protects the (budget)
surplus and still will save Social Security, that keeps the
American economy going amidst all this economic turmoil in the
world, that protects instead of damages the environment, and that
gives the kind of priority to our elementary and secondary
education that it so clearly needs,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But he indicated a willingness to give on some issues to avoid a
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will require us to put progress ahead of partisanship ...
and I hope we can do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, Congress had passed only six out of 13 major
appropriations measures, but Clinton vetoed one of them _ the $60
billion farm bill _ because it was nearly $4 billion short of the
$7.3 billion he requested in emergency relief for farmers and
ranchers hard hit this year by droughts and floods.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the farm bill would be rolled together
with at least five other appropriations measures today and placed
in one large catchall spending measure, called an omnibus bill,
that will likely be approved Friday by the House and Senate. At the
same time, Congress also will pass another temporary spending
measure that will keep government agencies running through early
next week just in case Clinton ends up vetoing the omnibus bill.
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus measure is likely to include funding for not only
the agriculture department, but for education, interior, labor,
justice and health and human service operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are we're going to be here through at least Sunday.
So, we need to be ready with a (temporary spending) bill to keep
the government open,'' said one Republican aide familiar with the
budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well this weekend, Lott said that he hopes
congressional leaders will be able to place the traditional
end-of-session phone call to Clinton telling him that Congress has
finally concluded its work for the year and is headed home. Asked
what he would say, Lott replied, ``You're in luck, Mr. President,
we're leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leader said he though negotiations were ``moving
along pretty well,'' with the administration. By Thursday night,
for example, the two sides had resolved some sticky issues. Among
them was agreement to provide $18 billion to prop up the
International Monetary Fund's lending coffers. But lawmakers were
still working out some differences over loan guidelines and other
reforms they want the IMF to initiate in return for the funding.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the negotiators also agreed to give Clinton
more than $1 billion for a program that provides heating fuel to
the poor, more than $1.2 billion for child care grants to the
states, and some $870 million for youth summer job programs.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the progress, there were still a number of problems.
The White House, for instance, was pushing for a provision in the
treasury and postal bill that require federal medical plans to
cover prescription contraceptives. The Republicans have stripped
the provision from the bill, but Clinton has threatened to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles to an agreement also included a Republican provision
in the foreign aid bill that would ban U.S. aid to groups abroad
that promote abortion. Republicans also were pushing legislation
that would prohibit using so-called sampling techniques to estimate
the nation's population in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Other sticking points included GOP provisions that would
prohibit the development of national elementary education
proficiency tests and that would make it easier for U.S. growers to
hire Mexican workers. &QL;

HOUSE OKS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BUT DELAYS HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For only the third time in history, the House of
Representatives on Thursday approved an impeachment inquiry against
a sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   The 258-176 vote culminated a day of partisan floor debate on
what should be done about allegations that President Clinton
committed perjury and obstruction of justice in the White House sex
scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about sexual misconduct any more than Watergate
was about a third-rate burglary,'' said House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., one of many lawmakers Thursday who
invoked the scandal that led to the House's last impeachment
inquiry vote 24 years ago. That episode forced the resignation of
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying under oath is important or it isn't,'' Hyde said. ``If
some people can lie under oath and some can't, let's find that out.
But if the same law applies to every body equally, that's the
American tradition... It's an onerous, miserable, rotten duty, but
we have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the resolution empowers the Judiciary Committee to
formally begin its investigation and to issue subpoenas, interview
witnesses and hold public hearings. After the vote, Hyde said the
committee would delay hearings until after the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton becomes the third president to be the target of an
impeachment inquiry. Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House but
the Senate failed by one vote to convict and remove him from office
in 1868. In 1974, the Judiciary Committee voted to impeach
President Richard M. Nixon but he resigned before the matter went
to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   During the floor debate Thursday, House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., tried in vain to enlist GOP support for an
alternative Democratic proposal that would place a Dec. 31 deadline
on the inquiry and require the House to first define what is an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ``let us all down,'' Gephardt said, but the
investigation of Clinton ``has hurt our nation and hurt our
children. We must not compound the hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   After Republicans voted down the Democratic alternative,
236-198, the House then passed the Republican resolution that has
no limits on time or subject matter. As a practical matter, it
expires with the end of the 105th Congress in January and would
have to be reauthorized when the 106th Congress is sworn into
session that month.
</P>
<P>
   Both votes reflected the tricky election-year politics
surrounding the impeachment debate. Only five House members voted
against both measures, in effect saying they wanted no inquiry
whatsoever. They were all Democrats: Rep. John Lewis of Georgia,
Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia, Rep. Paul Kanjorski of
Pennsylvania, Rep. Bob Filner of California, and Rep. Jose Serrano
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   After the Democratic version went down, a total of 31 Democrats
voted for the Republican measure. Most were conservatives from
swing districts. Five of those voted against their own party's
measure, but in favor of the GOP resolution. They were: Rep. Gene
Taylor of Mississippi, Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, Rep.
Virgil Goode of Virginia, Rep. Lane Evans of Illinois and Rep.
William Lipinski of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most difficult decision I've had to make (but) I
feel good about what I did,'' said Rep. Chris John, D-La., a member
of the Blue Dog Coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats who
voted for the Democratic measure and, after it failed, then for the
Republican resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this is truly the right thing to do for closure and to
set a standard so that if we go through this again in 20-30 years,
we know what `high crimes and misdemeanors' means.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the Constitution's criteria for impeachment,
along with treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, Democrats played down the number of defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being asked (by reporters) if ... we could keep that
number below 50,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., author of the
Democratic alternative. ``The fact is that 31 Democrats supported
the (GOP) resolution, but 85 percent of Democrats in the House
supported our position.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton said after the vote he was
``fine,'' adding ``I have surrendered this. This is beyond my
control.'' Clinton expressed hope Congress could move forward with
an inquiry that is ``fair,'' ``timely,'' and ``constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have been through a lot on this and I
think that everyone deserves that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, some Republicans said the evidence already
contained in the report on the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal
submitted by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr last month may be
strong enough to warrant the next step in the process: Approval of
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if further examination showed grounds for impeachment
were substantiated by the evidence, my vote would be for articles
of impeachment,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a conservative member
of the Judiciary Committee. ``But I wouldn't say anything is
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, however, members expressed chagrin over
what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect more of a circus spectacle,'' said Rep. Zoe
Lofgren, D-Calif., a Judiciary Committee member who had argued that
Clinton's misconduct with Lewinsky did not rise to the level that
she said should be reserved for impeachment: high-level wrongdoing
that puts the constitutional system in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd expect the kind of outrageous behavior we've seen
already.''
</P>
<P>
   The floor debate was marked by strained parliamentary politeness
on both sides, interspersed with temperamental outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the Republican measure would allow
Congress to conduct a ``fishing expedition'' of unlimited duration
that could include not only the Lewinsky matter, but such other
elements of Starr's four-year probe of Clinton as the Whitewater
land deal, the firings in the travel office and the procurement by
Clinton operatives of FBI files of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a process, Mr. Speaker,'' said Rep. William
Delahunt, D-Mass., a Judiciary Committee member. ``That's a blank
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also played up public exhaustion with the Lewinsky
story, arguing that other pressing needs were being neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., went through a laundry list of world
problems _ the crisis in Kosovo, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the
faltering global economy, families that cannot pay medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're talking about Monica Lewinsky!'' He added: ``The
president betrayed his wife. He did not betray his country. God
help this nation if we fail to recognize the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, however, stressed a more limited goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not make any charges,'' Hyde said at the outset. ``We do
not make any charges. We simply being a search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said: ``Closing our eyes to
allegations of wrong-doing constitutes a breach of our
responsibilities as members of Congress. Let history judge us as
having done our duty to uphold the rule of law.''

RUSSIA RESISTS ACTION IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the United States and its allies gear up for
military strikes that could come within days against Serbian
targets, the West's old Cold War foe, Russia, is doing everything
in its power to prevent any such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for Moscow, and for Serbia, is that there is little
an economically and militarily weakened Russia can do, despite a
blast of Cold War-era bluster and a flurry of last-minute Russian
diplomacy, to prevent the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from
carrying out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   While Western leaders say they have legitimate grounds to punish
the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, for the Serb crackdown in
Kosovo, Russia is increasingly concerned over what politicians and
analysts here see as NATO's contempt for the United Nations and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus is forming among Moscow's usually scattered
political forces that the NATO attacks, if they take place, will
cause a backlash against the West. This, it is argued, could
further set back relations that are already chilled after Russia's
financial system collapsed in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an attack will be seen as ample proof of NATO's overall
aggressive intentions,'' commented Pavel Felgenhauer, defense and
security editor for the newspaper Segodnya. ``Communists and
nationalists will cry out that Mother Russia is next in line for
attack and many Russians, stunned by the collapse of their
Western-oriented quasi-market economy, will believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Russian leaders have threatened to sever ties
with NATO, send peacekeeping troops to Yugoslavia to prevent a NATO
attack, unilaterally end an arms embargo against Yugoslavia and
further stall nuclear arms reduction agreements with the United
States. The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, has
threatened to break off ties with NATO. Ultranationalist groups
like the Union of Officers are already signing up volunteers to go
fight for Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This is all disturbing, but nothing the West has not heard
before. And Russia, currently trying to convince skeptical Western
creditors to release billions in loans put on hold after the
previous government defaulted on its debt payments in August, has
been forced to temper its tough talk. The saber-rattling has been
accompanied by a round of telephone calls to Western leaders by
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, plus
some urgent shuttle diplomacy by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it objects to the violent methods Milosevic has used
to crack down on separatist Kosovo, but says the conflict should be
settled through talks, and has vowed to use its power of veto to
halt any UN Security Council resolution on the use of force against
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ivanov met with Milosevic in Belgrade, then flew to
London to present his counterparts from the US, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy -- which, together with Russia make up the
so-called Contact Group on Yugoslavia -- a proposal from the
Yugoslav leader to unconditionally allow European officials into
Kosovo to monitor Serb troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this appears to be enough to stop NATO from acting.
Thursday, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters
in Brussels the 16 nations that make up the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization would ``in the next few days'' authorize the
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If force is necessary, we will not be deterred by the fact
that Russians do not agree with that,'' Albright told reporters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of that approach, Russian officials and analysts say,
is the precedent it sets for future conflict-solving in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carried out with or without a United Nations mandate, proposed
NATO air strikes against Serbia would inevitably create a
controversial precedent for the post-Cold War world,'' Yekaterina
Stepanova, a research associate with the Carnegie Moscow Center,
wrote in a recent commentary. Stepanova and others argue that
unlike the 1994 NATO bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions, strikes
against Serbia would constitute a declaration of war against a
sovereign state that happens to be Russia's ally.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would that underline Moscow's weakness, they say, but
also set a precedent that could be used against Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A military strike against Yugoslavia is a strike against us,
because it means that we are not being taken into account,'' said
Vladimir Lukin, head of the foreign relations committee in the
lower house of parliament, the State Duma. ``If a regional
organization like NATO...without a decision by the UN....decides to
launch a military strike against country that is solving its ethnic
problems in a way we don't like...that means for Russia that next
time, the same thing can happen when someone does not like the way
we are conducing affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia already has a province, Chechnya, that won defacto
independence after Moscow's brutal 20-month campaign failed to
crush a separatist rebellion. Ethnic tensions are strong in
Chechnya's neighbor, Dagestan, and separatist moods run high in the
Volga region of Tatarstan.
</P>
<P>
   US experts say that Russia is less worried about the precedent
NATO intervention in support of Kosovo's independence movement
would set for Chechnya or Tatarstan than it is by the idea that the
West can do whatever it chooses in Moscow's backyard. This has
added to jitters caused by NATO's plans to expand to include the
Soviet Union's former satelite states in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason the Russians oppose (the NATO attack) is
psychological,'' said Kurt Bassuener, director of the Balkan Action
Council in Washington, D.C. ``They don't want to be seen as being
an adjunct to the West. It's a cost-free way for Russia to
differentiate itself from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats have expressed consternation that Russia
should choose to express its differences at a time when senior
Russian finance officials are holding negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund over the release of $2.5 billion in
funds Moscow says it needs to meet its fourth-quarter budget
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov was quoted as saying Thursday
that Russia had ``quite a big chance'' of receiving funds from
international creditors if it keeps market economy principles in
place. As long as Russian officials are saying things like that, it
is hard to imagine a new Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that if NATO attacks and Russia does not
get its loans, relations with the West could sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is not going to start a world war over Yugoslavia,''
Lukin said. ``We are not going to send our troops there, but the
reaction will be harsh.''

SPYING OUT THE JOB MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ If you have ``superior intellectual ability,
toughness of mind and a high degree of personality,'' there's a job
waiting for you, particularly if you speak Farsi or other difficult
languages.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few drawbacks: You can't talk about your work
outside the office. In many cases, you can't even reveal where you
work. And, by the way, you might have to take the occasional
lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new CIA recruiting drive, launched last month by
the spy agency, which has been suffring in the tight job market.
After enduring years of staff shrinkage from cuts and brain drain,
the CIA is scouring college campuses for well-educated officers and
even offering signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Large ads in The Economist and other publications promise ``the
ultimate international career,'' filled with ``fast-moving,
ambiguous, and unstructured situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clandestine Service Trainee Program, for example, needs
people who can place moles in foreign governments and exploit the
criminal underworld. As the ad phrases it, ``Operations Officers
spearhead our intelligence collection efforts and are actively
involved in seeking new sources of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's Directorate of Operations, which oversees
clandestine work, plans to increase the number of its officers by
30 percent in the next seven years, according to spokesman Mark
Mansfield. He won't say how many new hires this involves, because
the directorate's current roster is secret.
</P>
<P>
   They also need employees to monitor terrorism, weapons
proliferation, the drug trade, and states such as North Korea and
Iraq. ``Some people have the mistaken impression that the agency
had a loss of mission in the wake of the Cold War, but nothing
oculd be further from the truth,'' Mansfield said. ``The mission
has grown more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to beef up the agency started under former director John
Deutch and have expanded under George Tenet, the current CIA
director. In a speech to agency employees in August, Tenet promised
a recruitment program ``that parallels the very best in private
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has long advertised for employees, but this campaign is
notable for its hard sell, due in part to the way the agency's
image has been tarnished by scandals over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting ad features the words integrity, intellect, and
common sense, written over a photo of a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed. Photocopies of the ads have drawn
laughs among former CIA employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC-hood has struck home, even at the agency,'' concluded a
former CIA officer with the pseudonym Edward G. Shirley. ``The use
of a smiling 21-year-old black women as being a typical agency
recruit is new, and that's simply a reflection of the institution's
desire to appear `with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the agency will not say whether the woman is
black or white, and it is not clear from the ad. Nor would
Mansfield disclose the name of the agency that designed the ad. He
did say that the CIA is making a special effort to recruit women
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is about time, said Richard Shultz, an &UR;  &LR; international
security expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University. Shultz was part of a group of academics and
retired intelligence officers who in the 1980s wrote a report
urging the CIA to improve its recruiting and diversify its
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   After obsessing for years about everything Soviet, the agency is
now more active in Asia, Africa, and the Mideast, ``where, to be
sort of blunt about it, white guys don't fit in,'' said Shultz &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said the agency must compete vigorously with
investment banks and consulting companies that seek the same
employee profile: personable, multilingual, computer-literate,
willing to live abroad. The CIA is particularly interested in
engineers, biochemists, economists, and people fluent in Farsi,
Arabic, and the languages of the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mansfield, college recruiters, ads, and the
agency's Web site generate more than 100,000 inquiries and 30,000
resumes from job seekers every year. The agency has streamlined its
hiring so that background checks that used to take six months can
now be done in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of headhunters out there ready to pounce on
strong candidates,'' Tenet said in a speech in August. ``To delay
is to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency &UR;  &LR; has decided to focus on just 60 colleges that have
proven records with the CIA or substantial numbers of minorities &UR; . &LR; 
They include Harvard, MIT, and Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also trying to overcome misperceptions that have
hampered it in the past. For example, someone who experimented with
drugs years ago is not automatically disqualified as an applicant
today. ``We look at how recent and frequent the drug use was,''
Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of the agency has suffered from the cases of
Aldrich Ames and Harold Nicholson, both convicted double agents who
spied for Moscow, said Abram Shulsky, a former staff member of the
Senate Intelligence Committee and author of ``Silent Warfare,'' a
book about intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough has come out like the Ames case that has made the
agency look unattractive,'' Shulsky said. During the Cold War,
recruiting was easier because ``part of the attraction was that you
belonged to a really elite institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the agency has lost its luster, it has had trouble recruiting
on the Ivy League campuses that used to provide a steady stream of
new officers, Shulsky said. ``In a sense, they're sort of forced
out to the more open job market.''

HUBBLE DETECTS ANCIENT GALAXIES 
</HEADLINE>

   The Hubble Space Telescope has succeeded in peering out through
space and back through time to find the oldest, most distant
galaxies ever seen. The discovery could lead to a better
understanding of the earliest formative stages of the universe,
astronomers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This observation is a major step toward fulfilling one of
Hubble's key objectives: to search for the faintest and farthest
objects in the universe,'' said Edward Weiler, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's head of space science.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient galaxies apparently are being seen as they were when
the universe was only about one-20th of its present age, or much
less than a billion years old, the astronomers said at a briefing
at NASA headquarters in Washington. The previously most-distant
galaxies ever seen, which were observed by Hubble almost three
years ago using a different camera, were estimated to go back to
about one-10th of the universe's present age, or more than one
billion years after the universe's birth.
</P>
<P>
   The latest pictures were taken by a new camera installed on the
orbiting telescope early last year. Called NICMOS _ the
Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer _ the camera had
as one of its main purposes to be able to peer farther out into
space by picking up infrared radiation. That's because objects that
are farther from us are speeding away, and therefore have their
light shifted out of the visible range of light and into the
infrared, where human eyes can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the new camera made it possible ``to extend Hubble's line
of sight farther out into the universe than we could any other
way,'' said David Leckrone, NASA's senior Hubble telescope
scientist. With the new observations, he said, ``that promise has
been fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier Hubble picture of distant galaxies, called the
Hubble Deep Field, astronomers found that many of the oldest
galaxies they could see appeared to be small, fragmentary pieces
that lacked the symmetry and elegance of more recent spiral or
elliptical galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   But the new pictures reveal that at least some of the objects
that appeared to be galaxy fragments were simply the brightest
parts of normal-looking galaxies. The infrared pictures fill in the
blanks, connecting several of the fragments into a single, normal
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the images that looked like multiple, small galaxies
might be individual pieces of larger galaxies,'' said Lisa
Storrie-Lombardi of the Carnegie Institution in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Although the most distant galaxies seen in the new picture are
too faint for the astronomers to be able to measure their exact
distances, about 10 of them appear to fit the expectations of what
the earliest, most distant galaxies should look like, said Rodger
Thompson, an astronomer at the University of Arizona and leader of
the team that made the observations.
</P>
<P>
   By continuing to analyze the details in this image, and perhaps
making follow-up observations of some of the newfound galaxies when
new, more powerful orbiting telescopes become available, Thompson
said, ``we can put together a much more complete scenario of how
our universe evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers believe they have a good understanding of how the
universe as a whole formed in a great explosion called the Big
Bang, about 12 billion years ago, and also of how billions of
individual stars formed within each galaxy. But they do not yet
have a clear picture of how the galaxies themselves came into
being. Observations of the earliest stages of galaxy formation
could help them to figure out how that process worked.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dressler, a Carnegie Institution astronomer and specialist
on galaxy formation, called the new observations ``an exciting
first step into the infrared view of the universe.'' The new
picture, he said, shows ``we were missing something'' in earlier
observations, and it is now clear that ``the universe was already
relatively well formed quite early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Leckrone said that while it will take more observations with
other telescopes to fill in the details, this picture has extended
our knowledge way out beyond the previous frontier. Just as the
earliest explorers of the American West provided the basic maps
that allowed the details to be filled in later by others, he said,
``this is the Lewis and Clark expedition of astronomy.''

LACK OF SLEEP IMPAIRS SURGEONS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surgeons who go without sleep for 24 hours will have impaired
performance similar to a motorist who is driving drunk, said an
author of a study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ara Darzi, a surgeon and professor at the Imperial College
School of Medicine at St. Mary's in London, said his study examined
the ``psycho-motor'' skills of surgeons after a full, disrupted or
sleepless night, and found their performance on simulated surgical
tasks declined with less sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgeons awake all night made 20 percent more errors and took
14 percent longer to complete the tasks than those who had had a
full night's sleep,'' said the study published in The Lancet, a
British medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   While Darzi likened sleep-deprived surgeons to drivers with a
blood alcohol level of .10 percent, the legal driving limit in
England, he said in a phone interview that his research did not
actually include anyone with such blood alcohol levels.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made such a comparison because the diminished
performance of surgeons who go without sleep is ``not different
than if you have a blood alcohol level of .10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at six surgeons who, on average, were 30 years
old and had five years of training. They were asked to complete
various skills that simulated laparoscopic surgery, which is the
procedure involved, for example, in common gall bladder or appendix
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The participants' skill levels were tested on six nights and
then the following mornings after they had a full night's sleep,
three interuptions or no sleep at all.
</P>
<P>
   This British study comes six months after a report in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, in which medical
residents reported spending an average of 56.9 hours on call in the
hospital each week and 70 percent said they had seen a colleague
working while impaired, most often because of lack of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of that study, which involved more than 1,100
second-year residents, said the results highlighted the need to
improve working conditions for medical residents. Those who seek to
reform medical training point out that truck drivers and pilots are
not allowed to work on such little sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Darzi said it is impossible for him to say exactly if or how
patient care is affected by surgeons, who often take on 36-hour
shifts and grueling hours during their residency training.

BELATEDLY, KOBLAUCH TAKES THE BLAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Brainlauch. Blauch Head. Chucklehead.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch made both the front page and the back page in
all the New York tabloids Thursday morning, and none of it was
complimentary. Even the august New York Times compared him to Bill
Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   Restraint? Well, nobody called him the Big Creep.
</P>
<P>
   But recognizing that no one was likely to cut him any slack,
either, the Yankees second baseman Thursday took what may have been
the most honorable course available to him, and certainly the one
that was most face-saving, in the shrill aftermath of violating
baseball's code of high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch stepped in front of his accusers at a press conference
Thursday afternoon and admitted, unequivocally, that after further
review, he was guilty as charged. While he still feels the umpires
erred, Knoblauch said he shouldn't have argued with them about
their failure to call interference on Travis Fryman of the Indians
in the 12th inning of Wednesday's game. Not when the ball was still
in play and Indians were flying around the bases. Not when it cost
the mightier-than-thou Yankees Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series to the Indians, whose general manager had
jokingly likened his team's chances in this series to the
Washington Generals' odds against the Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I screwed up,'' said Knoblauch, who added he came to
that conclusion after watching televised replays of the bunt play
on which he and the umpires disagreed as to whether Fryman
interfered with first baseman Tino Martinez's throw to first by
running inside the 3-foot lane allotted to runners down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up the play, and I feel terrible about that. You
know, I should have went and got the ball, regardless of what the
outcome of the umpire's call was. I basically screwed up the play
and feel bad for that, and I need to apologize to my teammates and
my manager and the Yankees and all the Yankee fans. Bottom line, I
screwed up that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch might have spared himself some grief had he admitted
as much on the night in question instead of defiantly saying that
he'd probably do it the same way, given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But an apology still would have come too late for the Yankee
Stadium crowd of 57,128 that booed him when he came to bat in the
bottom of the 12th inning, after the Indians took advantage of his
failure to react and scored three runs, breaking a 1-1 tie and
taking this best-of-seven series back to Cleveland tied at a game
apiece with the next three in Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill took issue Thursday with the
crowd venting at Knoblauch, who came to New York last winter in a
trade with the Twins and is on the verge of signing a contract
extension that reportedly will pay him $9 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed for New York,'' said the tightly wrapped
O'Neill, who is not known for blushing easily. ``To see someone
booed in the middle of the playoffs after we'd won four playoff
games in a row, that caught me by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee Stadium is a fun place to play, but Thursday I didn't
agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said he understood the fans' reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were booing me for screwing up the play,'' he said, ``and
you can't fault them for that. They're going to react to what they
see, and you know, I screwed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said he decided after replaying the play ``over in my
head hundreds of times'' to meet the media Thursday, unprompted by
his agent, teammates, or the Yankees' public relations apparatus.
That impressed his manager, Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was very hard with all that went on last night,
but it wasn't necessary for him to apologize,'' Torre said. ``We're
all in this thing. We don't get a chance to rehearse. We make
mistakes and have to live with them, have to work through them, and
I think that's what makes you tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you judge a good team _ when they can bounce back
from bad things that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was asked if he would be remembered for this play
above any other, much like Buckner is dogged by Mookie Wilson's
ground ball in the 1986 World Series that went through his legs,
allowing the Mets to win Game 6 and, ultimately, the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``if I never play another game, this will be
what I'll be remembered for. But hopefully, we can wipe that out
tomorrow. Hopefully, it will be a long career in New York, and
hopefully, a lot of good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out there tomorrow and when I leave this room, there
won't be any added pressure on me.''

PORTUGUESE NOVELIST JOSE SARAMAGO AWARDED NOBEL PRIZE IN
LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With sidebar NOBEL-LITERATURE-EXCERPTS)  
(js) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took
up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative
novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and
vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel
Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glasses often give him a
mien of severity, Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer
_ and one of the first card-carrying Communists _ to become a Nobel
Literature laureate. He is also the fourth successive European to
win the prize, after Italy's Dario Fo in 1997, Poland's Wislawa
Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised Saramago
``who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony
continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Saramago discounts the influence of Latin American
``magical realism'' on his work, his novels often use the
supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational as ways of
addressing complex questions of faith and existence. Many of his
novels are set against a backdrop of political or historical
events, but it is his unwavering concern for individual fate that
gives his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known books, all published in the United States, are
``Baltasar and Blimunda,'' ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo
Reis,'' ``The Stone Raft'' and ``The History of the Siege of
Lisbon.'' His latest book available in English, ``Blindness,'' in
which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind, was
described as his ``symphonic new novel'' by Andrew Miller in The
New York Times Book Review on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no cynicism and there are no conclusions, just a
clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are,
a quality than can only honestly be termed as wisdom,'' Miller,
himself a novelist, wrote. ``We should be grateful when it is
handed to us in such generous measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Saramago learned of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport,
where he was preparing to fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the
Canary Islands after attending the Frankfurt Book Fair. Earlier
this week, he participated in a round-table of Portuguese writers
on the topic, ``Why I am still a Communist.'' He immediately
returned to the fair where he was received with cheers and bouquets
of roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally very happy for myself,'' he said. ``I am also
happy for my country.'' Later he told a news conference: ``The
Portuguese language had to wait 100 years for this. There have to
be ways and means of protecting the language so that it does not
become a museum, but is something that is alive. The writer's role
is to protect it and work with it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SHRUGS OFF IMPEACHMENT TOPIC
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday's House vote to
begin impeachment proceedings against him left his fate up to
Congress, the American people and, ''ultimately, in the hands of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless one or another passes judgment, Clinton vowed to remain
engaged in an 11th-hour battle with Congress over budget
negotiations centered on farm aid, education, tax cuts and
emergency international assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone miss the point, Clinton used a top-level budget
strategy session as the background for responding to the historic
House impeachment action.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have surrendered this. This is beyond my control,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I can do, is to do my job for the American people,''
Clinton told reporters at a brief photo opportunity before the
White House meeting. ''And I'm working in a way that I hope will
restore their trust in me by working for the things that our
country needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government expects to spend about $1.7 trillion in
the coming year. That spending is directed by Congress through 13
separate appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   With the 105th Congress expected to adjourn this weekend,
however, more than 100 separate spending issues remained unresolved
between the White House and Congress, which had sent, as of late
Thursday, only four of the 13 bills to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has signed two, not yet acted on one and vetoed the
fourth _ the agriculture appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by Congress contained $4.2 billion in aid but
cut, among other things, Clinton's request for spending that
Republicans considered non-emergency, including $120 million for
research and another $60 million for rural development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the structure of the money and the amount were inadequate
to deal with what has become the worst farm crisis for a decade,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ''They need to do more
work on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto returns the bill to Congress either for an
attempt to override the veto _ considered unlikely _ or
negotiations leading to more aid.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, White House officials said, negotiations between
administration officials and Republican leaders appeared close to
bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   On one major point, Clinton has asked Congress for $18 billion
in additional funding for the International Monetary Fund, charged
with helping to maintain stability in global currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   With one-fourth of the world in recession, and another quarter
rapidly moving that way, the IMF's pool of emergency bailout money
has been largely depleted. If the United States deposits another
$18 billion, other member nations will chip in roughly $82 billion
more, giving the IMF an additional $100 billion to manage economic
crises around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved Clinton's request, but the House
approved only $3.5 billion and has sought to make the additional
money contingent upon specific IMF reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he favors certain reforms, but opposes holding
up the additional funding over the issue of IMF governance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IMF needs the money right now,'' said a White House
official. ''The crisis is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are also under way concerning a proposed tax cut in
the face of anticipated budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have approved an $80 billion tax cut over five
years, but as many as 10 Senate Republicans have refused to go
along with it. While some say it's too small, others have
contended, as does Clinton, that any budget surpluses should be set
aside until Republicans and Democrats can agree on ways to shore up
the financially threatened Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Talks late Thursday were centered on a far smaller tax cut,
perhaps as low as $6 billion, that would extend a set of
business-oriented tax preferences such as credits for companies
that invest in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton portrayed himself as working hard and remaining
above the fray, his spokesman chastised the House vote for an
impeachment inquiry as partisan and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed, however, that the impeachment process would
not distract Clinton from his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the middle right now of the traditional crunch time
of business here in Washington,'' Lockhart said. ''We don't have
the luxury of being distracted ...We're going to be doing the
people's business, fighting for a budget, fighting for the
president's
</P>
<P>
   priorities in the appropriations process.''

 PARIS: with it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The award was also celebrated in Lisbon, where President Jorge
Sampaio described it as ``recognition of Portuguese culture,''
while the local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it as a
credit to his own party. ``As a member of our party,'' he noted
solemnly, ``Saramago makes a great contribution to our ideals and
to the struggle for social change.'' The laureate's fiction,
though, is never overtly political.
</P>
<P>
   Saramago, whose body of work includes poetry, essays, plays and
a journal as well as 10 novels, is unusual for having emerged as a
major literary figure only at the age of 60. His novels have since
been translated into 30 languages, selling particularly well in
Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany. While he has not been
well known in the United States, his novels have always been
critically well received there.
</P>
<P>
   For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed of
becoming a writer. Born into a family of rural laborers and raised
in Lisbon, he was forced by poverty to leave school while a
teen-ager and learn the trade of car mechanic. Yet he managed to
publish a small novel at the age of 25. Later, he found work at a
Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive and censorial
atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him from
writing.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago
felt free to find his voice. A member of the Portuguese Communist
Party since 1969, he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario
de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely
to seize power in Portugal. But an anti-Communist backlash in
November 1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began
translating French texts into Portuguese to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he also turned to novels, publishing three in
succession in 1977, 1978 and 1980. But it was in 1982, with
``Baltasar and Blimunda'' (``Memorial do Convento'' in Portuguese),
that he achieved his international breakthrough. ``This is a rich,
multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time has a
historical, a social and an individual perspective,'' the Swedish
Academy noted Thursday. ``The insight and wealth of imagination to
which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago's work as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, the book
tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran, Baltasar, and a
visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heavens aboard a flying
machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory
Blimunda. This fantastic story takes place against the very real
background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra
Convent by thousands of men held in the grip of the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   When the novel was published in the United States in 1987,
Irving Howe acclaimed it as ``brilliant'' in The New York Times
Book Review. ``Mr. Saramago is constantly present as a voice of
European skepticism, a connoisseur of ironies,'' Howe wrote. ``I
think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility,
caustic and shrewd.''
</P>
<P>
   In his next novel, ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,''
which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando
Pessoa, who appears in it as a ghost, Saramago sets his story in
the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale
following the romantic and sexual misadventures of a
poet-physician. Writing in The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang
called it ``a rare, old-fashioned novel _ at once lyrical, symbolic
and meditative.''
</P>
<P>
   Saramago, whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his
unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses, sought a
different form of freedom in ``The Stone Raft,'' where he imagines
the confusion unleashed when the Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks
free from the rest of Europe and begins drifting toward the New
World and threatens to collide with the Azores. To the delight of
Britons, Gibraltar is left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the bitter satire, ``The Gospel According to
Jesus Christ,'' proved controversial, with God shown as using the
innocently human Jesus to create a religion that has spawned
violence and intolerance. When a Lisbon jury picked the book as
Portugal's entry for a 1992 European literary prize, the country's
conservative government vetoed the choice as blasphemous. It was
then that Saramago decided to leave his small, crowded apartment in
Lisbon for the relative solitude of Lanzarote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' published in the United
States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision
of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word
``not'' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal. With
this ``lunatic creative act,'' as Edmund White put it in The New
York Times Book Review, he ``totally derails the national saga'' by
affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate
12th-century Lisbon from Moorish occupation.
</P>
<P>
   White ended his July 1997 review with a prescient remark. ``Word
has it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel Prize,'' he noted. ``No
candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition than this
novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent publication of ``Blindness'' in the United
States, only Saramago's latest novel, ``Todos os Nomes,'' or ``All
the Names'' still awaits translation into English. In the tradition
of Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he has now embarked on his
journals. The fourth volume of these ``Cadernos de Lanzarote'' was
just published in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth the equivalent of
$967,500 this year, at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10.

   The heat is unbearable and the spectators refresh themselves
with the customary glass of lemonade, cup of water or slice of
water-melon, for there is no reason why they should suffer from
exhaustion just because the condemned are about to die. And should
they feel in need of something more substantial, there is a wide
choice of nuts and seeds, cheeses and dates. The king, with his
inseparable Infantes and Infantas, will dine at the Inquisitor's
Palace as soon as the auto-da-fe has ended, and once free of the
wretched business, he will join the chief inquisitor for a
sumptuous feast at tables laden with bowls of chicken broth,
partridges, breasts of veal, pates and meat savouries flavored with
cinnamon and sugar, a stew in the Castilian manner with all the
appropriate ingredients and saffron rice, blancmanges, pastries,
and fruits in season. But the king is so abstinent that he refuses
to drink any wine, and since the best lesson of all is a good
example, everyone accepts it, the example, that is, not the
abstinence.

</P>
<P>
   When it became clear and beyond question that the Iberian
peninsula had separated completely from Europe, as people began
saying, The peninsula has broken away, hundreds of thousands of
tourists, for as we know this was the peak season, hastily left
their hotels, pousadas, paradores, inns, hostels, pensions, rented
houses and rooms, camping sites, tents and caravans, without paying
their bills, suddenly causing the most colossal traffic jams on the
roads, which grew even worse when cars were left abandoned
everywhere, it took some time but then it was like a lit fuse,
people are generally slow in recognizing and accepting the
seriousness of situations, the futility of having a car, for
example, once the roads to France were cut off.

   They waited for almost an hour. When the door-bell rang, she got
up and went to open the door, but there was no one on the landing.
She tried the internal telephone, Very well, he'll be right down,
she said. She turned to her husband and told him, They're waiting
downstairs, they have strict orders not to come up to the flat, It
would appear the Ministry is really alarmed. Let's go. They went
down in the elevator, she helped her husband to negotiate the last
few steps and to get into the ambulance, then went back to the
steps to fetch the suitcase, she lifted it up on her own and pushed
it inside. At last she climbed in and sat beside her husband. The
driver of the ambulance turned round to protest, I can only take
him, those are my orders, I must ask you to get down. The woman
calmly replied, You'll have to take me as well, I've just gone
blind this very minute.

COMMENTARY: FIRE, ICE AND FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some say the end will come by fire, and some by ice, but I say
farce is just as likely.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, probably not the farce that consumes all Washington at this
very moment. This one we may survive so long as the public keeps
jeering at those grave suited gents who keep staring into
television cameras and saying, ``It's not about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forfend that anyone should think it's about sex! (You've
heard them say this; I merely paraphrase.) It's about the
Constitution. It's about little Jamie Madison and the sanctity of
law and Paula Jones' right to a trial untainted by perjury, no
matter how lofty the perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the honor of that great white house on Pennsylvania
Avenue and the great office it contains. It's about the American
family and the American home, it's about the flag and Mom's apple
pie, about the preservation of the two-pants suit and the Brooklyn
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Or whatever suits and Dodgers have become since the
screenwriters of 1942 concocted these speeches about what was worth
fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   What do we have here? A gray-haired authority figure, verging on
second childhood, finds himself revisiting the forbidden adolescent
vices. And in his place of business.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, with a woman not half his age, though even
younger than that emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   It's a comedy that was already too shopworn for Moliere 300
years ago. What makes it high farce in our age is the high-minded
debate about whether it's a high crime and misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the media, the solemnity of the matter
provides license to dish out the ever-loving,
socko-for-circulation, lubricious details about body parts, said
details provided by Kenneth Starr in the cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Until the press turned into the media, I suspect, this kind of
circus would have had trouble getting into town. Back in the Bronze
Age when I first reported for Washington duty, the personal vices
of politicians and statesmen were not considered to be news of
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   The press' old-timers have since taken a lot of scolding for
this. Indeed, among media people it is now considered such a
shameful betrayal of the industry's duty to tell absolutely
everything that I hesitate to confess to having once lived by that
antique code.
</P>
<P>
   That many politicians dabbled in illicit sex while other
politicians reveled in it was well known to most reporters of that
day. Many could cite names and occasions.
</P>
<P>
   That these dabblings and revelings should be widely advertised
to the entire population, including nuns, Boy Scouts and cat
lovers, was a proposition I never heard seriously entertained until
the ``Cold War'' began to ease off.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Washington was such a big, vital, all-absorbing
story that reporters lacked the idle hours necessary for
philosophical musings on the ethics of one's trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington story was too exciting for any sensible reporter
to try peddling political adulterers to the home office. There was
the H-bomb _ thousands of H-bombs, in fact. There were Berlin
crises, Cuba crises, dangerous old Red China, subversion
everywhere, oppression, torture . . .
</P>
<P>
   Reporters assumed that carnal sin was another of the many
deplorable commonplaces of the human condition, hence a problem for
clergy to cope with, certainly not the concern of reporters, many
of whom were themselves no strangers to vice.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter, I was untroubled by skipping the sex lives of the
government famous in my dispatches. Nor have I ever been persuaded
that the reader was betrayed or the world endangered by letting
these birds have a little privacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is now said that details about the vices of politicians must
be told to all humanity so that the public can make vitally
important judgments about their ``character.'' I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been clear to me that the sexual adventurings of
Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Martin Luther King affected
the creation of the New Deal, the conduct of World War II and the
Cuban missile crisis, or the progress of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly, I suspect, had this stuff been known at the
time, the principals would have been so tied up by lawyers that the
Nazis would have won the war, the Soviet Union would have blown up
the world, and slavery would now be making a comeback.

NEXT STEP   ON LONG ROAD IS UNCLEAR

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the House has voted for an impeachment
inquiry, what happens next?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Nobody really knows.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-authored measure approved Thursday by the House
was so broad that the Judiciary Committee's inquiry could last for
years and could look at any action by President Clinton, including
matters unrelated to Clinton's relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most significant questions about the inquiry haven't
been resolved, such as whether Lewinsky or Clinton will be called
to testify. Nor is it clear whether the committee's investigative
hearings will be held in closed session, or whether the proceeding
will be conducted mostly in public.
</P>
<P>
   There will a hearing this month on a constitutional question,
but the real work will begin sometime after the Nov. 3 elections.
The inquiry will be controlled by Republicans, and there is not a
lot that Democrats can do to stop it, unless the elections result
in an unexpected Democratic takeover of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a long time, a year to go, unless Democrats
do real well at the polls and Republicans decide to compromise,''
said Representative Martin Meehan, the Lowell, Mass., Democrat who
sits on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There are innumerable scenarios that could unfold. These range
from a quick, post-election inquiry on the Lewinsky matter and a
possible vote on articles of impeachment, to a lengthy
investigation into many areas, including the Whitewater real estate
deal, the firing of the White House travel office staff, the
improper use of FBI files, and campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   However the inquiry proceeds, it is far from clear whether the
House will ultimately vote to impeach the president, and even less
clear whether the Senate would come up with the two-thirds vote
required to convict and oust him.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the inquiry is expected to follow the outline
of the report presented to the House by independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr, which focuses on allegations that Clinton lied about and
tried to cover up an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with Watergate, when a Senate committee uncovered much
information during dramatic hearings, most of the information in
the Clinton-Lewinsky case has been explored and written about at
length in the Starr report. Thus, the Judiciary Committee might
focus on reinterviewing key witnesses and deciding whether to draw
the same conclusions as Starr. That would require the committee
staff to interview Lewinsky and might lead to her public testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But such an appearance is fraught with peril for Republicans.
While many GOP members have said the impeachment proceedings are
``not about sex,'' one of the points made in the Starr report is
that Lewinsky and Clinton disagreed about whether the president
touched certain parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   That is important because Clinton has maintained he was
``legally accurate'' when he swore that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky. Clinton based his assertion on the
argument that the definition of sexual relations used in his
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment lawsuit did not
include oral sex performed on him.
</P>
<P>
   But the definition would have included the touching of
Lewinsky's breasts and other areas. Lewinsky said Clinton did touch
these parts of her body, while the president has denied it. Clinton
Thursday declined to say whether he would voluntarily appear before
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   So are Republicans going to try to determine whether Clinton
lied when he denied touching parts of Lewinsky's body? As Abbe
Lowell, the chief counsel for the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, said earlier this week, the case for impeachment is
based on ``who is telling the truth about who touched who, when and
where.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans don't call Lewinsky as a witness, Democrats may
try to have her testify because she has said no one told her to lie
about her relationship with Clinton. But Democrats cannot call
Lewinsky to testify without Republican permission.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also might try to get Starr to testify to ask about
alleged leaks from his office about grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, the Judiciary Committee's Republican counsel,
said this week that there are 15 possible impeachable offenses. The
committee could narrow or expand that list.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, meanwhile, has told the Judiciary Committee that he can't
rule out the possibility that he might find more impeachable
offenses and forward his findings to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, chairman of
the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, has said he
will forward his findings about alleged campaign-finance abuses by
Democrats to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde of
Illinois, while pledging Thursday not to conduct a ``fishing
expedition,'' made it clear he might expand the inquiry. ``I cannot
say that we will never address other subjects, nor would it be
responsible to do so,'' Hyde said. ``If substantial and credible
evidence of other impeachable offenses comes to us, as the
independent counsel as suggested, the Constitution will demand that
we do our duty.''

COMMENTARY: TALK IN A CROWDED CAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I got into the cab at the airport and there they were
_ 20-odd of my good friends. About 60 other people also were
waiting in the cab.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All were Americans of accomplishment, and all had signed a
full-page ad in The New York Times against the impeachment of Bill
Clinton. I read it as we rode through Queens.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What struck me most about their statement was not the opposition
to impeachment. That is shared by many Americans, not including me;
we can argue that tomorrow, again.
</P>
<P>
   It was the great ``danger'' they presented _ a U.S. president
twisting in the wind for months to come while the world was on the
edge of war in the Balkans and the Mideast, international terrorism
made war on America and the world economy was at risk.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They said the ``power, authority and vigilance'' of the U.S.
president must always be secure and evident, particularly now.
</P>
<P>
   I asked _ did you not realize that the deepest and continuing
failure of President Clinton is precisely that he has not exercised
power, authority and vigilance in international affairs, and shows
neither the talent nor credibility to do so in whatever time is
left to his presidency?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did you ask yourselves certain questions as your own test of his
demonstration of presidential ``power, authority and vigilance''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About the Mideast, you are content, are you, that six years of
Clinton policy have left Saddam Hussein a far more powerful leader
and dreaded terrorist than when Bill Clinton became responsible for
containing him? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How does Clinton's ``authority and vigilance'' strike you as
Saddam once again bars U.N. inspection, the only barrier to his
production of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons? Does it
bother you that the last time Saddam did that, the Clinton
administration warned that just wait, next time you will really
catch it _ and again does nothing? What believability would
patched-up inspection have now, serving Iraq's pleasure? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans: Can you explain what U.S. policy is? If so, could
you tell U.S. diplomats, who have no idea?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, to save Bosnian Muslims from slaughter by Bosnian Serbs
armed by Serbia and its dictator. That is a good reason, but Bosnia
could have been spared all bloodshed years ago. That is, if Clinton
had insisted on the partition of Bosnia, seceding from Yugoslavia
into Muslim, Serbian and Croatian areas. Instead he trotted along
after Germany and other European nations trying to make a unified
country that was and remains a mirage.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. planes blasted Bosnian Serbs into furious, temporary
submission. Then Richard Holbrooke did the best anybody could to
persuade the three parties to accept unity. But the nation of
Croatia treats Bosnian Croatia as part of its territory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton said no U.S. troops for Bosnia, no sir. Then he
said U.S. troops for a year, then 18 months, then, oh, shut up,
stop asking. He knew how to send them, not how to get them out of
the foreign army assigned to keep the place from blowing up into
another war.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. planes may attack Serbia to save the lives of ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian state of Kosovo. Americans will agree to
that. But again Clinton will not tell them how it will all end; no
plan, ``authoritative'' or otherwise.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anti-proliferation: Clinton has continued and expanded the
disastrous Reagan-Bush policy of allowing American and foreign
businesses to help sharpen the aim and range of missiles for China,
and so for Beijing's customer list, such as Syria and Iran. Years
ago we used to say in New York that America sold Japan the scrap
metal from the city's dismantled overhead train lines, but that at
least Japan returned it all free, at Pearl Harbor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton created a large, dangerous ineptitude in foreign policy.
That reality is clearly understood by leaders all over the world _
particularly those who wish us evil. Perhaps it is one reason the
U.S. military is edgy about more commitments. Over the top with
Bill Clinton _ it does not have that certain ring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this is no ground for impeachment. But it is no ground
either for my friends in the cab to fear for American safety if
Clinton is removed _ or summons up the honor to resign from the
presidency he maimed through his own reckless instability.

SOMBER FEELING PERVADES IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate majority leader Trent Lott tried to downplay
Thursday's impeachment inquiry vote, calling it ``procedural,'' but
for other lawmakers it was emotional business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the words `impeach William Jefferson Clinton,' it
was a sinking feeling that hit me hard in the gut,'' said
Representative Mary Bono, Republican of California.
</P>
<P>
   When Bono rose to deliver her speech, it was with a quaking
voice and a visibly nervous demeanor. Other Republicans were at
turns somber, defiant and even, jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republicans made a pact that they wouldn't cheer or
clap when their party members spoke. But they did give House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois a hero's
reception.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, party faithfuls awarded the
impassioned speeches of their leaders, Representatives Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and David Bonior of Michigan, standing
ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to stop this daily mudslide into the
nation's living room,'' Bonior said, to much applause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood off the floor, especially among Democrats, was
somber. Representative Marty Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat and
Judiciary Committee member, said Democrats had moved past their
anger toward Clinton and were now simply saddened by the turn of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realize this is not just about Clinton anymore,'' he said
after speaking on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, frustration and anger spilled out because Democrats had
to accept a two-hour time limit on debate. Representative Bill
Hefner, Democrat of North Carolina, cut off after 20 seconds,
banged the lecturn with his fists and stomped away.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York, rose and said
only, ``I find it ironic that I only have 20 seconds when the
Republicans want an unlimited amount of time to conduct their
fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the public clamored for an opportunity to witness the
making of history, standing in the pouring rain for hours in a line
so long it wrapped around one-quarter of the Capitol building.
Capitol police, who said they had never seen such a line, rotated
people into the usually-deserted galleries above the House chamber
in 15-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the onlookers were some who were more than familiar with
the proceedings: former congressmen Tom Railesback, a Republican
who sat on the Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment
proceedings, and Robert Garcia, a New York Democrat indicted during
the Wedtec scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the audience was one of President Theodore Roosevelt's
grandsons, Matt Drudge, an Internet muckracker collecting material
for his Drudge Report, and country and western crooner Charlie
Pride, swinging through on tour that began in Lubbock, Texas. Of
the proceedings, Pride, dressed in a black felt suit and a maroon
shirt, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about nonpartisan but it seems to me they're all mad
at each other. I think it's overplayed. And I don't understand all
this procedure ... If I was a good songwriter, I'd make something
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat,
pumped Pride's hand and explained the particulars of parliamentary
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   And if Pride didn't have a tune in mind to sum up the day,
Moakley did: ``We're all going to be singing `Who's Sorry Now.' ''

MARKETS TAKE CITIGROUP EARNINGS REPORT IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citigroup Inc., the financial services giant formed by the newly
combined Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., said Thursday that it
would report an estimated $700 million of net income for the three
months ended on Sept. 30 after being hit by about $1 billion in
losses from the recent turmoil in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate for third-quarter earnings compares with $1.5
billion in combined net income for the two independent companies in
the period a year earlier, or $2.1 billion of combined net income
before allowing for a reorganization charge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two huge financial companies announced their intention
to merge in April to form the nation's biggest banking, insurance
and investment conglomerate, the combined value of Citigroup has
fallen more than 50 percent, to an estimated $72 billion, as
financial markets have been roiled by Russia's default, Japan's
continuing economic problems, President Clinton's troubles and most
recently by the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the
big hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup said Thursday that Salomon Smith Barney, its
investment bank, would report a net loss of about $325 million for
the third quarter. These losses, it said, were caused by a $700
million loss in the firm's global arbitrage business and from
credit losses related to Russia. Salomon, which said on Aug. 31
that its losses for July and August totaled $150 million, was one
of the first financial companies to warn investors of the growing
losses caused by volatile market conditions since mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Citigroup said that its Citibank subsidiary would
report a $130 million loss in its corporate banking business
because of about $240 million of after-tax losses related to Russia
and about $100 million in after-tax losses related to the decline
in the value of its bond holdings. Despite these losses, the
company said its consumer banking and insurance businesses
continued to do well.
</P>
<P>
   After the stream of bad news from financial companies in recent
weeks, analysts seemed to take Citigroup's announcement in stride,
as did the market: shares of Citigroup rose 75 cents, to $32.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings were a little lower than we expected,'' said
Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``The real
shift is that they are moving to reduce risk throughout the
company. The consumer business is performing very well. I think
earnings will be considerably better in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   John Keefe, an analyst at Keefe Worldwide Financial Services, a
New York consulting firm, said: ``It's not atypical to use a
combining quarter like this to do the wash. Unfortunately in this
quarter there's plenty of laundry to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Citigroup is expected to report third-quarter earnings in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., who
recently cut his estimates for the company, said: ``Definitely the
weakness at Salomon was meaningfully worse than anticipated. What
we are more likely to see in the third quarter is downside and not
upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Citigroup's two co-chairmen and co-chief
executives, John Reed and Sanford Weill, tried in an interview
Thursday _ the first day of trading for the stock of Citigroup _ to
put a brave face on their future together, stressing that this was
a merger with good long-term prospects whatever recent market
volatility might have done to their company's stock price. They
also said they did not envision making layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Weill maintained that despite the current uncertainties in
financial markets there were ``incredible opportunities to grow
one's business,'' even though ``every now and again,'' the
financial markets might be upset by ``vicious cycles.'' Ticking off
the travails the markets face: falling stock values, Russia,
Long-Term Capital and other difficulties, Weill said, ``We have the
ability to withstand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial leaders defended their combined company's part in
the recent $3.65 billion rescue of Long-Term Capital. ``I believe
that the industry coming together with a private-sector investment
in Long-Term Capital was in the long-term interests of the capital
markets,'' Weill said. Travelers, which put up $300 million as part
of that rescue, has an executive on the team overseeing Long-Term
Capital as it tries to work itself out of its multibillion-dollar
difficulties. That may take some time. ``What's happened to our
investment? I don't know, but I don't think it's up,'' Weill said
with a laugh. Both men said they did not have any of their own
money in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   They also seemed concerned about Brazil's economic and financial
difficulties and gave some insight into how they work together.
``I'm quite interested with how we're going to deal with the
pressure on Brazil,'' Reed said. ``Mexico was dealt with in one
way, Russia in another. The market is confused. What the market is
looking for is for a pattern to emerge.'' He wondered ``as to how
this pressure on Brazil will be dissipated. You can't have a
developing country with interest rates at 50 percent,'' for a long
period, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember. Anything you say, on Wednesday I'll have to
defend it,'' Weill interjected with a smile, referring to his
forthcoming trip to Brazil. That's how things have to work at a
company with two chairmen.

THE EXTRAORDINARY NOW HAS BECOME ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The debate has sharpened, but Washington's
capacity for shock has dulled.
</P>
<P>
   And so the House's formal decision Thursday to undertake
impeachment hearings for only the third time in the nation's
history _ to begin, as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.
Hyde of Illinois put it, ``a search for the truth'' _ provided no
surprise, prompted no gasps of astonishment, set forth few ripples
in the country or the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In nine months, the extraordinary has become ordinary; the
historic, routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sex with an intern in the White House, the erosion of
centuries-old presumptions about the presidency and presidential
privilege, the release of grand-jury testimony that in any other
case would be sealed forever, the conclusion by an independent
counsel that a twice-elected president of the United States
``criminally obstructed the judicial process,'' the broadcast of
taped presidential testimony about genital contact _ any one of
them in any other year would be cause for consternation, even
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in less than a year's time, each of them has become
front-page news, the salacious and the serious mixing in a toxic
brew that has contaminated public life, endangered venerable
institutions and alienated the governing class from the public it
is meant to serve.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Thursday's the debate in the House chamber offered
one of those rare moments, seldom occurring more than once a
decade, when the lawmakers' speeches were high-minded and
high-toned, delivered for the verdict of the voters and for
history. The tone was sober, the proceedings grave, the result
portentous.
</P>
<P>
   And as the lawmakers cast their votes, there was the
unmistakable recognition that a barrier was being breached, that
the 435 men and women who had grown accustomed to casting ballots
on appropriations bills and deregulation initiatives were suddenly
about to tread on different, forbidding ground. A president and the
presidency hung in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the similarities between Thursday and the last
time such a resolution was debated end.
</P>
<P>
   There was a partisan edge to what Democratic Representative
Charles E. Schumer of New York called ``a serious and solemn day''
on Capitol Hill, and that foreshadowed a bitter fight once the
House Judiciary Committee opens deliberations on actual
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Watergate days, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter
W. Rodino Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, labored long and carefully to
win the confidence of moderate Republicans, an achievement that
lent legitimacy to the assault on Nixon and eventually led to the
president's resignation. But there is no middle ground in the
Judiciary Committee, nor in the House.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republican rebels stormed the gates of the House in
1974, the casualties weren't the Democratic liberals the newcomers
assailed, but the Democratic moderates who were in closely balanced
congressional districts. The GOP revolution did more than replace
Democrats with Republicans. It removed the middle ground from the
House. The new House was at once more conservative and more liberal
than the old House.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 105th Congress is about to become known as the
Impeachment Congress, much as the 93rd Congress was. But the road
to impeachment is easier to tread today because it was traveled so
recently.
</P>
<P>
   For 106 years between the administrations of Andrew Johnson and
Richard M. Nixon, Congress battled with the White House, fighting
over spending priorities, struggling over wars, bickering over
treaties, sometimes even questioning the motives and morals of the
chief executive _ but never resorting to the ultimate step of
trying to impeach the president until the Watergate scandal
convulsed the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a quarter-century after the last impeachment drama,
Congress is doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawmakers who will determine the destiny of
President Clinton _ including Representatives John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan and Charles B. Rangel of New York, both Democrats, and
Senators Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and Paul S.
Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland _ played major roles in the
near-impeachment of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Watergate crisis, the impeachment hearings, the
Nixon resignation and the ascension of President Ford are all
within the lifetime of every lawmaker on Capitol Hill. None of the
principals in Watergate _ Senators Howard H. Baker Jr. and Sam
Ervin, Representatives M. Caldwell Butler, Barbara C. Jordan,
Robert McClory, Tom Railsback and Rodino _ had any personal memory
of the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. For all of them,
impeachment was an arcane procedure, inserted in the Constitution
to be used almost never.
</P>
<P>
   But the weapon, used in the past with trembling hands, has been
unsheathed twice within memory. Thursday the House picked it up
again. Like so much else after this year of upheaval, impeachment
is not a taboo anymore.

U.S. MAY SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR AFRICA BOMBING SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors said Thursday that the government
was seriously considering asking for the death penalty for two of
the suspects arrested after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in August.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion was made in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
during an arraignment that for the first time assembled three
defendants being held in New York. Federal authorities are
continuing an investigation into the bombings and the activities of
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding the
attacks and other acts of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty will seriously be considered in this case,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald told Judge Leonard Sand.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald was referring to Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali and
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, each of whom was taken into custody in Kenya
in late August, and flown to New York to face charges. Each has
been charged with separate counts of murder in the deaths of more
than 220 people in the attacks. The charges carry the death penalty
if the government decides to seek it.
</P>
<P>
   The third defendant, Wadih el Hage, who has been described as
the former personal secretary to bin Laden, is charged in a
conspiracy to attack U.S. citizens abroad, a count that carries a
maximum sentence of life in prison. He was arrested in Arlington,
Texas, and transferred to New York.
</P>
<P>
   All three men entered pleas of not guilty Thursday before Sand.
Odeh, speaking through a translator, added, ``Not guilty at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither the defendants' lawyers nor the prosecutors would
comment after the brief hearing. Each defendant smiled and spoke
softly with his lawyer before the hearing, and none of the three
displayed any noticeable reaction to Fitgerald's announcement that
capital punishment was under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The issue first arose when Sand asked about procedures to insure
that capital defendants are assured of having lawyers with
experience in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Before the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, can decide
to seek the death penalty, she must receive authorization from
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The three men in court Thursday were arraigned on charges issued
in a new indictment returned Wednesday. A fourth defendant, Haroun
Fazil, who is suspected of leading the attack on the embassy in
Nairobi, was also charged in the indictment this week. He remains a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not address his case in court Thursday, but the
charge against him also carries the death penalty if he is captured
and the Justice Department seeks it.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's hearing, Sand also asked that prosecutors
investigate whether el Hage can receive greater access to a
telephone. His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, has complained that his
client has been told that he could make only one phone call every
30 days to his family in Texas. Fitzpatrick said he was making
contact with prison officials and was confident that an arrangement
would be worked out.

NORTH AMERICA POLLUTION FALLS DESPITE RISE IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ One of the first detailed studies of environmental
pollution across North America shows a slight decrease in the
amount of hazardous substances being released into the air, water
and soil, but the improving record of U.S. industry was largely
offset by hefty increases in pollution by Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Wednesday in Montreal, does not include
conditions in Mexico because usable information still is not widely
collected, nearly five years after implementation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement required such environmental
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The continental study was conducted by the Commission for
Environmental Cooperation, which includes representatives from the
United States, Canada and Mexico. It estimates that in 1995 about
20,000 manufacturing plants reported that they had produced more
than 2.8 billion pounds of hazardous substances, including known
carcinogens, that were released directly into the air or water, or
were transferred to landfills.
</P>
<P>
   That amount represents a decline of 1.5 percent across North
America, and is considered an important step toward slowing the
spread of dangerous substances across international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But when broken down by country, the figures give a slightly
different picture of North America. Pollution produced by
industries in the United States declined 2.1 percent in 1995 from
1994, while in Canada the amount of pollution released or
transferred increased 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Methanol, ammonia, zinc, nitric acid and toluene made up almost
half of the pollutants released in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The report also indicates that while the United States has far
more industrial sites, Canadian plants, on average, emit almost
twice as much pollution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lisa Nichols, a program manager for technical cooperation at the
environmental commission, said it was not clear why Canadian plants
produced higher average pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report is not expected to cause much controversy in
the United States, it is likely to raise environmental concerns in
Canada about the weakness of the system of provincial environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially there has been an assumption that the Canadian
performance is as strong as the U.S., but part of what makes this
report so significant is the extent to which it shatters that
national myth,'' said David Winfield, research director at the
Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy, a nonprofit
organization in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   When the commission released similar results in its first report
last year, local governments and industries in Canada said it was
unfair to compare general statistics on pollution among unrelated
industries in different states or provinces.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report is also expected to focus attention on the
lack of progress Mexico has made toward meeting the requirements of
the environmental side agreement that President Clinton tacked onto
the NAFTA legislation in 1993 to get it approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they had started collecting information
on industrial pollutants last year but still had a long way to go
before they compiled a list comparable to those monitored in the
other two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Morales, an official with the National Institute of
Technology in Mexico, said some Mexican industries had objected to
the inclusion of certain hazardous substances on the list of about
200 pollutants that will be tracked. Since NAFTA took effect in
1994, the Mexican government has feared that environmental
regulations could be used in a way that harms domestic industries.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Emerson, senior economist for the Environmental Defense
Fund, said he was disturbed by the lack of progress in Mexico.

STOCK PRICES GYRATE, DOLLAR TUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Includes budgeted JAPAN-YEN)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors fled to the ultimate safety of short-term US Treasury
bills Thursday as US stock prices gyrated, the dollar tumbled
again, and talk of a worse-than-expected slowdown in the US economy
shook financial markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term Treasury bills had their biggest gain in more than
six years. But prices on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, a
haven in past weeks for anxious investors, fell sharply. Traders
said shorter-term securities stand to gain the most if the Federal
Reserve, as many expect, cuts interest again next month rates to
counter a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after plunging as much as 277
points, recovered to close at 7731.91, down 9.78 points, or less
than 1 percent. The Nasdaq Composite index, a barometer of the
risky high-tech industry, pared a 105-point loss, ending down 43.49
points, or 2.97 percent, for the day.
</P>
<P>
   World stock markets were also down, from a 2.69 percent fall in
London's FT-SE 100-stock index to a 4.98 percent plunge in
Frankfurt's DAX index. The Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo plunged 5.78
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and investment professionals said it was not yet
clear whether the market turmoil was a result of rising pessimism
about the US economy or a more technical financial event that would
burn itself out.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that investors who for years had borrowed money
in Japan at extremely low interest rates in order to invest in
higher-paying dollar-denominated securities or hot European stocks
have begun unwinding those positions. The reversal by so many
institutions of a popular arbitrage strategy put downward pressure
on the dollar and other US markets, said Jonathan Francis, head of
global strategy for Putnam Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been seeing in the last several weeks, in the
equity, the fixed income, and the foreign exchange markets is those
last big entrenched investors are getting blown out of that
trade,'' Francis said. ``There may be several more weeks of
volatility yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Other economists believe that something more fundamental may be
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the plunge in the dollar is principally related to the
expectation that the US economy is going to cave in, not
necessarily into a recession but cave in on growth in coming
months,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Primark Economic
Decisions in Boston. ``This factor is, for any country's currency,
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The activity Thursday in financial markets followed a day in
which the US dollar fell sharply against the yen. On Wednesday, the
US dollar plunged 8.8 percent against the Japanese yen _ its
biggest decline in 25 years _ as hedge fund investors retreated
from their bets on US rates.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily leveraged hedge funds sold US-dollar positions,
analysts said, as banks refused to extend loans to fund their risky
strategies a day after the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, hinted
at further interest-rate cuts. To spur the economy, the Fed last
week trimmed the key overnight lending rate by a quarter of a
point, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar tumbled another 2 percent Thursday. During late-day
trading, the dollar stood at 118.85 yen, up from 121.33 yen
Thursday, though it had hit a low of 111.6 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The US government's bellwether 30-year bond fell 2 points, or
$20 per $1,000 bond, driving the yield up 13 basis points to 4.99
percent. The decline in bonds brings three-day losses to 4 14/32
points, or $44.38 per $1,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Thompson, who heads global fixed-income investing for
State Street Global Advisors in Boston, said the bond rout was due
to sales by Japanese and other investors who are ``sell when they
see the US dollar weaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The safest place for investors was in three-month bills, which
staged the biggest rally since July 1, 1992. Yields were driven
down 24 basis points to 3.87 percent on a bond-equivalent basis.
Yields on two-year notes _ the most actively traded Treasuries _
fell 6 basis points to 4.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Respected Wall Street forecaster Abby Joseph Cohen, of Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., weighed in with pessimists by lowering her estimate
for operating profits for the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index. The change, she wrote in a note to clients, reflect
``more subdued expectations for global growth in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen does not expect a recession, but sentiment is becoming
increasingly bearish.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. two days ago became the first prominent
institution to forecast recession in the United States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Ralph Acampora, a one-time bull and analyst for Prudential
Securities, predicted that the Dow could sink as low as 6500,
compared with a bottom of 7400 he predicted earlier. Acampora, a
longtime bull, turned tail on August 4 by predicting a bear market
for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At its low Thursday, the Dow was down 20 percent percent from
its July high.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Marston, a professor of international finance at the
Wharton School, said that he believes the unwinding of complex
institutional positions is part of a move ``back to basics.''
However, he said the danger in declining equity markets is that
they may slam consumer spending, the economy's biggest engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look forward into 1999 can we count on consumer
confidence staying up there when we have a market that has gone
down so sharply and we have such an uncertain political
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In their darkest moment, investors have begun to fear that ``the
threat to the world isn't inflation _ it's deflation. That is a big
threat,'' said State Street's Thompson.

   Carolyn and Sonny Hine have cashed two of the biggest gambles in
racing history. Not only did they spend $800,000 to supplement Skip
Away into his winning 1997 Breeders' Cup Classic, but they also
turned down numerous offers to sell him as a young horse. Given the
opportunity to become instant millionaires, they chose to keep Skip
Away because, as Sonny put it, ``What would we do with the money?
Buy more horses.'' Now they're millionaires a dozen times over, and
they still own their horse.

   Handicappers at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie might as well be
whistling in the wind if they gamble serious money based on
quarter-horse performances in which running times are drastically
affected by ``tailwinds'' and ``headwinds.'' Would that be a gentle
evening breeze, or a gale like we saw on opening night? Lone Star
needs a device to measure wind velocity, like other quarter-horse
tracks have.
</P>
<P>
   The still-unidentified buyer of leading 2-year-old Worldly
Manner is going to great lengths to avoid publicity. But there are
clues. The buyer is alive, which rules out Elvis, and we know that
the purchase price was in the neighborhood of $5 million, which
eliminates everyone who has recently invested in a hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas left the quarter-horse game for thoroughbred
racing in the early 1980s, and has since trained winners of almost
every major race in the country. So why did he show up at Lone Star
last night with a pair of quarter horses? He has never won the
All-American Futurity, and he says that is one of his remaining
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Racing is suffering from an epidemic of illegal use of
performance-enhancing drugs, and three trainers in Florida faced
suspensions because their horses tested positive for ... bee
pollen. Or rather, for the 50 parts per million of caffeine that
the bee pollen contained. They got off the hook, but go figure.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Wall Street Journal market analyst picked Churchill
Downs as his No. 1 stock pick. Not a bad idea. Word on the street
all year has been that Churchill Downs, which also owns Indiana's
Hoosier Park and Kentucky's Ellis Park, is interested in acquiring
a major winter track. At first it was rumored to be Gulfstream
Park, but now the favored target is said to be Fair Grounds in New
Orleans. Fair Grounds chief Bryan Krantz said he has not been
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Cavonnier hasn't run since hurting a tendon in the 1996 Belmont
Stakes, but he's coming back this month. Da Hoss hasn't raced since
he won the 1996 Breeders' Cup Mile, and he runs tonight. Why not
bring Cigar back? He's sound, except for where it counts most at
stud.
</P>
<P>
   Blueprint for a slow horse: Listen Lady raced four times and was
beaten a total of 78 1/2 lengths, yet some pedigree wizard decided
to make her a broodmare to pass her genes to future generations.
Her most famous foal is Zippy Chippy, now forcibly retired by
Finger Lakes stewards after he decided to crown an 0-for-85 career
by refusing to leave the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred jockeys and trainers are mostly a breath of fresh
air compared with the participants of other professional sports.
But quarter-horse people are nicer still, even though they lose so
many photo finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Daily purses at Fair Grounds were more than $200,000 two years
ago, topped $230,000 last year and are projected at about
$240,000-$250,000 for the 1998-99 season. If Lone Star can show
that kind of upward mobility, plus an improved racing surface,
they'll be going places.
</P>
<P>
   There are quarter horses whose names don't include the words
``Dash,'' ``Cash,'' ``Victory'' and ``Easy,'' but there aren't many
in this country, and they don't seem to run as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsman's Park outside Chicago is remodeling its facility to
offer car racing, and plans to run horses on a dirt strip placed
over the asphalt. Horse owners and trainers are concerned, but they
shouldn't be the track's biggest problem. Horsemen love to complain
about racing surfaces, but they are amateurs in the crybaby
department compared with the NASCAR boys.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar and now Skip Away. Both ridden by Jerry Bailey. Good
horses make good jockeys, but is that a coincidence? Probably not.
Hoofbeats Skip Away's big day Skip Away goes for history tomorrow
in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup. If he can defeat Gentlemen
again _ and he will be heavily favored _ he will become the first
North American racehorse to exceed $10 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar has the record at $9,999,815. Skip Away has $9,506,360,
and a victory will put him at a little more than $10.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Six horses were entered in the mile-and-a-quarter race, which
will be televised live on KXAS/Channel 5 from 4-5 p.m. as the
centerpiece of the Breeders' Cup Preview. Other Belmont Park races
to be shown on the telecast are the Champagne Stakes for
2-year-olds and the Turf Classic Invitational for older grass
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away has won the Gold Cup the past two years. Only the
great gelding Kelso won it more than twice _ he did it five times
(1960-64), and by today's purse standards, that would have been $3
million right there.
A shot at $5 million Churchill Downs and Breeders' Cup Ltd. have
received approval from the Kentucky Racing Commission to jointly
offer a $5 million guaranteed pick-six pool on Breeders' Cup day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 7 wager, to be called the Ultra Pick Six, will include
the last six of the seven Breeders' Cup races, excluding the
Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   On four occasions this summer, tracks in Southern California
have offered guaranteed pick-six pools ranging from $1 million to
$3 million. But nationwide betting always exceeded the guaranteed
amount, so the tracks or their insurance companies never had to put
up money. The Breeders' Cup wager should be no different; with no
guarantee, the pick-six handled $3.3 million last year, and that
figure should at least double.
No phone betting allowed Texas residents who had phone betting
accounts in Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut have been cut
off at the request of the state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of six other states _ Utah, Hawaii, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi and Georgia _ made similar
requests, but no horseplayers live in their states anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Park president Bob Kaminski confirmed that the Grand
Prairie track sought to pull the plug on area residents betting on
races through phone accounts. He pointed out that Lone Star
receives no revenue from phone bets on out-of-state tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Phone betting is legal in eight states, but most tracks in other
jurisdictions haven't seemed concerned about the competition. You
Bet, a company offering wagering plus live race video and audio on
its computer site, says it is accepting business from horseplayers
in 40 states.
Big racing weekend With the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup races at Churchill
Downs approaching, this is a huge weekend for prep races.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, of course, is prepping for the Classic, which he will
try to win for the second consecutive year. Other top Classic
contenders in action are Awesome Again, favored in tomorrow's
Hawthorne Gold Cup; and Touch Gold, who runs Sunday in the Fayette
Handicap at Keeneland, perhaps against Super Derby winner Arch.
</P>
<P>
   Among other big races and favorites at Belmont tomorrow are the
Champagne, for 2-year-olds (Lemon Drop Kid, Tactical Cat); the
Frizette, for 2-year-old fillies (Things Change, Oh What a
Windfall); and the Beldame, for fillies and mares (Sharp Cat). Also
tomorrow is Santa Anita's Oak Leaf for 2-year-old fillies
(Excellent Meeting).
</P>
<P>
   Other races Sunday include Keeneland's Alcibiades, for
2-year-old fillies (Silverbulletday); Belmont's Turf Classic
Invitational (Buck's Boy, Dushyantor, Cetewayo); Santa Anita's
Norfolk, for 2-year-olds (Darling General); and also at Santa
Anita, the Lady's Secret Breeders' Cup Handicap, for fillies and
mares (Magical Allure).
Buzz With the announcement of the $5 million Breeders' Cup
pick-six, Santa Anita's $2 million guaranteed pool tomorrow has
gotten lost in the shuffle. It will cover races five through 10.
... The 6-year-old Gentlemen will try Skip Away again in the Jockey
Club Gold Cup for what might be the final race of his career. He
will be running with blinkers for the first time. Gentlemen outran
Skip Away in 1997, but not this year. ``When he was at his best, I
wouldn't have traded him for any other horse,'' trainer Dick
Mandella said. ``I haven't had that this year, so now I'm grasping
at straws trying to find that one thing that will get him over the
hump. Putting blinkers on was something \Rjockey\S Corey
\RNakatani\S mentioned, and I figured, `Why not?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop is almost ready to resume training after minor
throat surgery Sept. 27, and could make the Breeders' Cup Classic,
trainer Elliott Walden says. ... Da Hoss makes his comeback tonight
in the Cliff Hanger at The Meadowlands. Victory Gallop and Da Hoss
are owned by the Preston brothers from Houston. ... Lone Star
2-year-old filly champ Arrested Dreams was being pointed to the
Frizette, but will miss the race because of sickness. ... Hurricane
Georges peeled off an 80-foot strip of roof from the Fair Grounds'
new grandstand, but the rest of the New Orleans track was unharmed.

ANALYSIS: GUESSING AT CLINTON'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Va., Conn., N.Y., Mass., Mich., Ga.)  (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH, CLINTON-VOTE, CLINTON-SCENE,
CLINTON-DAY) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk of duty and Constitution, it was
not all that difficult for the House to open a formal impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton Thursday. The more troublesome
question is how Congress will bring to a conclusion the process
that Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called ``this venture, this
excursion, this journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom, which Democrats have clung to across
these tumultuous weeks for their party, is that the less impulsive
Senate will never accumulate the votes to convict Clinton, and that
inescapable fact will finally force some kind of a deal between the
president and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to remain in office,'' pronounced Rep.
James Moran, D-Va. ``That's a foregone conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But conventional wisdom has often been wrong in this strange
political year dominated by Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. And issues with a high intensity factor sometimes take on
a life and momentum of their own on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Many House members _ including some Republicans _ fear that
having opened Pandora's box Thursday, they will never get it closed
again without first moving through impeachment of the president and
a Senate trial that could consume Congress for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's out of control,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn. ``Everything's set in motion, and I don't know how
you put it back in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of riding a runaway train could diminish if after
months of deliberations and gathering evidence, the Congress and
the country jointly come to a national conclusion that Clinton
should be impeached, tried and removed from office, like the
consensus that Richard Nixon faced when he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that Congress could rush ahead without brakes even
as the American people continue to resist the idea that Clinton
should be ousted over the Lewinsky affair. ``This has the potential
to be the most divisive issue in American public life since the
Vietnam War,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, two sharply different schools of thought co-exist
on Capitol Hill about how the president's fate will be determined.
Which one prevails could well be decided by the outcome of the
elections just three and a half weeks away, unless Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, changes all the political calculations by
forwarding to Congress new allegations of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first scenario, the Republicans make only modest gains
in November. They decide they have wrung maximum political
advantage out of Clinton's misconduct and that prolonged
impeachment hearings could hurt them going into the 2000
presidential elections. And for a brief window of time, the
pressure to appease the party's conservative base would be off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say now that if nothing more comes out and there is no
dramatic changes of seats in the House and the Senate, this will be
resolved short of impeachment,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. ``If
the elections stalemate, that will be a signal from the American
people not to do impeachment, but to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternate script could play out if the Republicans make
strong inroads in November. Many Republicans have already signaled
their deep belief that Clinton has committed perjury, obstructed
justice, and placed himself above the laws that he has sworn to
uphold.
</P>
<P>
   One of their loudest voices, that of the House majority whip,
accused Democrats Thursday of seeking ``the path of least
resistance. This is when we pitch the law overboard when the mood
fits,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, ``when we ignore the facts in
order to cover up the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   For such Republicans an election sweep would be read as a strong
mandate to move forward with actual impeachment. And it could cause
Democratic unity to crack, putting the president in even more
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats on Thursday were adamant that their few
defections on the inquiry vote mean that they are likely to stand
united against actual impeachment. ``If Republicans are only able
to pick off 15 percent of our members on a procedural vote three
weeks before an election, how many votes are they likely to get
four months from now on articles of impeachment?'' asked one
Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the inquiry is likely to go on hold until after the
elections. Hyde said no hearings would be convened until later in
November. But battles are already brewing between the two parties
over how to conduct the investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has said he sees little reason to bring Ms. Lewinsky
forward in public hearings, but the Democrats are likely to demand
her appearance, adding to the sense of circus on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have impeachment hearings where the star witness is
not called and cross-examined,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
``You have to have Monica Lewinsky testify. You have to have her
mother testify. You have to hear from Betty Currie and Vernon
Jordan.'' And Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that Starr himself will be
someone the Democrats want in the witness chair.
</P>
<P>
   As these events move forward, Clinton's aides would dearly love
to find a way to strike a deal on some punishment short of
impeachment _ not in the Senate but before the House takes the
actual impeachment vote, according to a Democratic strategist close
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has thought so often about his legacy, is now
fighting not to become the only other president besides Andrew
Johnson to be impeached by the House. (Nixon resigned after the
House Judiciary Committee reported out three articles of
impeachment and before a House vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is the figure in the House who would have the stature
to broker a deal, and just like Clinton, the speaker has an intense
interest in how he is perceived in history. But it is far from
clear whether the Georgia Republican _ who presided from the
speaker's chair through the entire House debate _ would have any
interest in such a role.
</P>
<P>
   He has his own personal considerations to weigh. He will be
standing for re-election as speaker when the new Congress convenes.
His relations with Clinton have ranged from furious to occasional
moments of alliance, while his relations with House Democrats have
ranged from poor to awful. In a rare bipartisan leadership meeting
over impeachment last month, he lectured House Democrats that he
would be fairer to Clinton than Democrats were to Gingrich when his
ethics troubles resulted in a House reprimand and a $300,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one House Republican with a good antenna for the
speaker's intentions said that should the politics and timing be
right, ``I think he will try to broker a deal. He could come in at
just the right moment and show he's above it all.'' But Rich Galen,
a close associate of Gingrich's, said that if the evidence shows
that Clinton committed perjury under oath, ``I don't think the
speaker will think it's his role to get in the way of that
process.''

GUILLEN'S ZEST FOR LIFE SHINES THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Changing leagues after 13 years in one place would be
hard for anybody, but it was even harder for Ozzie Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Guillen is a social animal. He talks to his
teammates. He talks to the opposing players. He talks to the
opposing manager. He talks to the opposing coaches. He talks to the
umpires. He even likes to talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard,'' says the man who has always been one of the
league leaders in sock exposure. ``I was in Chicago for 13 years. I
spent more time there than I did in Caracas. I knew everybody. I
definitely missed the American League at first.''
</P>
<P>
   What he most definitely does not miss is sitting in front of a
television set watching everyone else play in October. In those 13
years as a member of the Chicago White Sox, he participated in six
postseason games. He is now a member of the Atlanta Braves, who
have become a death-and-taxes type of postseason inevitability in
the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie is 34 and he has no illusions about being a regular. His
job here is to back up starter Walt Weiss, pinch hit (he slapped
Dan Miceli's first pitch for a pinch single in the eighth inning of
Game 1 in the NL Championship Series Wednesday), and just be Ozzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got another job here,'' he explains. ``I'm in charge of
the dugout and the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Care to elaborate, Oz?
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys on the bench are going to get the same money and the
same ring as the regulars if we win, so we should do everything we
can to earn it,'' he maintains. ``If a guy comes in after making a
good defensive play, he should hear about it. There is nothing
worse than being on a team with a dead bench. I don't let that
happen around here.''
</P>
<P>
   His season began with the Orioles, but suffice it to say that
didn't work out. He went 1 for 16 in 12 games before deciding he
couldn't stand it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in and asked for my release,'' he explains. ``I said,
`Mr. (Kevin) Malone (the assistnat general manager), `I'm not doing
anything for this ball club. You need another pitcher or a catcher
more than you need a backup infielder. I would be very easy to get
rid of.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. He was prepared to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   Many miles to the north of Caracas, a mini-crisis was brewing.
The Braves had a couple of hurting shortstops, Weiss and Rafael
Belliard. Bobby Cox sent out an SOS via his general manager, John
Schuerholz. Ozzie Guillen, a superfluous item on a floundering
Baltimore team, was suddenly a desirable commodity on one of
baseball's elite clubs. If anyone doesn't believe that success in
this business is so often defined as being in the right place at
the right time, here is Exhibit A in defense of the premise.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie would have taken anything he got just to be on this
particular ball club. He wound up getting 264 at-bats and he made
good use of them, hitting a respectable .277 while doing his usual
solid job in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzie Guillen saved our rear ends,'' says Cox.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a while to get acclimated, and it really didn't have
anything to do with changing leagues. ``For me, the first 10 or 20
at-bats were like spring training,'' he says. ``After a couple of
weeks, I felt more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   He was never a star but he was good enough to hold down a
regular job for more than a decade, which is a pretty good
distinction. He peaked as a hitter at .288 in 1994, when he flirted
with the league lead in batting for much of the first half of the
year despite hitting ninth. He was a very good fielder, a
base-stealing threat in his prime, and a very solid professional.
</P>
<P>
   He was, as they say, a tough out, and he very nearly caused mass
coronaries in Boston eight years ago. For it was Guillen who hit
the line drive down the right-field line on which Tom Brunansky
made the diving catch into the foul pole with two outs in the ninth
to save the 1990 AL East title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard a crowd go from so loud to so quiet to so loud _
all in the space of two seconds,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Guillen has been a VGG _ Very Good Guy. He has a
zest for life and a true passion for the game. A lot of people are
happy that he has this last opportunity to savor spotlight games
and situations with a team like the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this game,'' he says. ``If you come from where I come
from, you would treasure every day you can put the uniform on. I
hate it when guys treat the whole thing like a business. You've got
to enjoy the game. And you've got to respect the game. And you've
got to understand the game. There are going to be a lot of 0 for
4s, no matter how good you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise to him that the Braves play in October every
year. ``They are professional,'' he says. ``If you need a strike,
they throw a strike. If you need an out, they get an out. They know
how to play the game here. The focus is on winning, nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year? Who knows? This whole experience is a bonus, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of happy guys here,'' Guillen says, ``but I
don't know of anyone happier than me.''

WAC SPLIT NOT PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having returned triumphantly from their almost-secret mission to
the Central Pacific, the SMU Mustangs are now off to the land of
frozen sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the local dialect has it, Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   It is also roughly the midpoint of the 16-team Western Athletic
Conference's last year, possibly an apt moment to get Mike Cavan's
views on one of the weightier issues of our time.
</P>
<P>
   And so, someone asked the SMU coach for a few words on how the
Mustangs' chests would swell with pride at the opportunity to hold
aloft the banner of the True WAC in the lair of those unprincipled
secessionists in Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they're part of the group that's leaving?'' he said, in
the manner of one responding to a luncheon guest's breathless
revelation that his granddad once met your great aunt Hilda.
``Well, all that stuff has been a little hard to follow. To be
honest, I don't really know which group is leaving and which one is
staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I haven't been here long enough to figure out who the 16
teams in the league are, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is, we just got a win \R28-0 against Hawaii\S, and
we need another one. And we're going up there to play a team whose
only loss was by seven points to Georgia _ in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have to fly into Cheyenne and then ride a bus for about
two hours to get to Laramie. And on Monday, they said it snowed up
there and it was minus-7 \Rdegrees\S or something like that, and
the roads were bad, and The Gap was closed _ whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, to tell you the truth, I haven't really given much thought
this week to the WAC splitting up.''
</P>
<P>
   A common refrain, it seems, among the schools of what we might
call the WAC East. TCU (3-1, 1-0) is standing upright and looking
pretty good. Everyone else is feeling a bit woozy.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa, for example, received an odd memento from the Big WAC's
last year _ a second consecutive road game at Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever positive tidbits that might have crossed the Golden
Hurricane's path this year, luck isn't one of them. In the past two
games, Dave Rader's offense has produced 775 yards and nine
turnovers, and Tulsa has lost both. Now comes the news that,
because of scheduling considerations, there will be another road
trip into the nest of the WAC's best team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Rader said, ``at least it can't be any worse than last
year,'' which is a bit like Noah saying, ``Gee, I bet it never
rains like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping into Fort Collins last year, the Hurricane was met by a
blizzard. After an 18-inch snowfall, the game was delayed until
Sunday. When it finally was played, Tulsa committed turnovers on
its first six possessions and lost, 44-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of our favorite memories,'' said Rader, whose team is
2-2 (0-1 in the WAC) after a promising start.
</P>
<P>
   Rice will journey to the West Coast for its first engagement
with San Jose State, which will be, along with the Owls, part of
the remaining WAC next year.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the two teams have given snaps to six different
quarterbacks and lost six times, but both are 1-0 in league play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had an off-week, which was probably a good thing,''
Rice coach Ken Hatfield said. ``We've had three tough losses in a
row \Rincluding a 59-21 rout by Texas\S, and we're just trying to
get some people well. We've got two new quarterbacks and we've just
tried to give them as many reps as possible.

   The Owls lost quarterback Jeremy Bates (knee) in the second game
of the year, and are hoping junior Chad Richardson can run the
spread option well enough to make them a contender. The backup is
Corey Evans, a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the new air of uncertainty, halfback Michael Perry,
the WAC's leading rusher last year, is recovering from an ankle
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Spartans, 52-14 losers at Virginia
last week, have problems stopping the run. Just what every spread
option team loves to hear.

   The only missing ingredient _ a quarterback _ was discovered in

``He's a tough kid, with an incredible pain tolerance. We've just

3-1 in WAC play, the /real'' prize is the Commander-In-Chief's

the nation in rushing (302.8) by a hair over the Middies (302.3),

Oregon, New Mexico State and Colorado State. ``We need a break,''
Bailey said. ... Assessing his team's 31-21 loss to Fresno State,
BYU coach LaVell Edwards had no problem pinpointing the cause: ``We
had a jillion turnovers,'' he said. This week, the Cougars play
UNLV (0-5), which has lost its games by an average score of 42-12.
``Well, I guess this is the best time to be playing them,'' Rebels
coach Jeff Horton said. ``If you really believe that.'' ...
Although SMU might dread the upcoming weekend, Wyoming's Dana Dimel
isn't counting on a tap-dance win. ``They have two quarterbacks
/RChris Sanders and Josh McCown/S they seem comfortable with, and
two outstanding tailbacks /RRodnick Phillips, Kelsey Adams/S,''
Dimel said. ``I don't see any difference between this team and the
one they had last year _ except that to some extent, they have been
a victim of the schedule. To me, they look to be as good as anyone
on our schedule.''

 &HT;    House launches impeachment investigation
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For only the second time this century, the House of
Representatives launched a wide-ranging impeachment investigation
Thursday against a popularly elected president.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 258 to 176, the Republican-led House made President
Clinton the first chief executive to be threatened with removal
from office since Richard Nixon faced impeachment proceedings in
the Watergate scandal in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report about Clinton's
conduct in his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his
effort to conceal it is the jumping off point for the inquiry. But
the House put no limits on topics the House Judiciary Committee may
examine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States is the trustee of the
nation's conscience,'' Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the committee
chairman, said. ``We are entitled to explore ... the circumstances
that have been alleged to compromise that position.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.), one of
Clinton's staunchest allies, countered, ``The president betrayed
his wife. He did not betray the nation. God help this country if we
fail to recognize the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   After four hours of debate and votes that mainly lacked the high
drama the occasion would suggest, the House directed the committee
``to investigate fully and completely whether sufficient grounds
exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its
constitutional power to impeach William Jefferson Clinton,
President of the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a brief statement to reporters after the vote: ``I
hope that we can now move forward with this process in a way that
is fair, that is constitutional and that is timely. ... It is not
in my hands. It is in the hands of Congress and the people of this
country _ ultimately in the hands of God. There is nothing I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I am fine,'' Clinton added. ``I have surrendered
this. This is beyond my control. I have to work on what I can do. I
trust the American people. They almost always get it right. They
have for 220 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, just 31 Democrats voted for the Republican-drafted
resolution. A procedural vote that was, in effect, a show of
support for a Democratic alternative that called for a more limited
investigation, failed 198-236.
</P>
<P>
   In a Congress notable for the fractiousness of its Republican
majority, GOP lawmakers voted unanimously for the broad impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Georgians John Lewis and Cynthia McKinney were among just five
Democrats who voted against both measures, opposing any further
investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who labored
all week to minimize Democratic defections, expressed the anger and
resignation many Democrats feel about the situation that has pushed
substantive legislation to the periphery of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question today is not whether to have an inquiry,''
Gephardt said. ``The question today is what kind of inquiry this
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats worried that Republicans would drag out the
investigation for electoral purposes and, using well-worn campaign
rhetoric, accused the majority of putting aside legislation on
education, health care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also voiced fears that Republicans would expand
the inquiry to include the Clintons' failed Whitewater land deal,
the firing of the White House travel office staff, the transfer of
900 FBI files to White House personnel -- matters that Starr has
had under investigation for more than four years -- as well as the
export of sensitive missile technology to China and illegal foreign
campaign contributions in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   When Gephardt, in his speech on the House floor, listed these
subjects as potentially part of the investigation, many Republicans
murmured, ``That's right,'' then broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats who voted for the broader inquiry said they
have concerns about the GOP's political aims. ``But I take Henry
Hyde at his word,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Texas), one of
the 31 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for the most part, hewed to their argument that the
Constitution establishes an impeachment process. The House is
merely following that process, which was triggered by Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seized on Gephardt's comments and the paucity of
Democrats who favor dropping the matter completely to put a
bi-partisan spin on the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde expressed hope that Thursday's vote would provide the
foundation for heightened cooperation in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a better chance for non-partisanship to rear its
lovely head now that this is behind us,'' he said at a news
conference following the vote.
</P>
<P>
   As he has pledged for the past week, Hyde said he would try to
wrap up this stage of the investigation by the end of the year, a
date the Democrats tried and failed to include in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's investigative staff will begin almost immediately to
interview potential witnesses for hearings that would not take
place until after the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution approved Thursday gives Hyde and Rep. John
Conyers (D-Mich.), the panel's ranking Democrat, the power to
decide to issue subpoenas. But should they disagree on a subpoena,
the GOP-controlled committee would vote whether to issue, which
could come into play if Democrats wish to summon Starr or Lewinsky
and Republicans do not.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting articles of impeachment and other formal impeachment
proceedings, if the committee determines they are necessary, almost
certainly would not take place before a new Congress is sworn into
office on Jan. 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the 105th Congress ends on Jan. 3 and lawmakers in
the 106th Congress would have to vote to re-start the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich refrained from taking a partisan role in
the debate, although he voted for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich presided over the entire proceedings and looked on
impassively as two Democrats, Barney Frank of Massachusetts and
Nancy Pelosi of California, raised Gingrich's ethics case in
discussing whether to investigate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said Republicans were being inconsistent in their
treatment of Gingrich, re-elected as speaker last year despite
admitting to providing misleading information to the ethics
committee, and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat, who was a member of the ethics
committee, accused the Republicans of a double standard ``which
exults the speaker and moves to impeach the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the few comments Gingrich made during the debate was a
plea for quiet in the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few debates more important and more serious than
that which we're currently having,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans retain their House majority in November and
Gingrich is re-elected as speaker, he would be likely to preside
over an impeachment debate, if there is one.
</P>
<P>
   No president who has won election in his own right has been
impeached, although the Judiciary Committee voted articles of
impeachment against Nixon in 1974 and the Democratic-led House
seemed certain to follow suit. Nixon resigned before the House
could act.
</P>
<P>
   The full House has impeached only one president, Andrew Johnson,
in 1868. He succeeded to the office from the vice presidency with
the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. The Senate fell one
vote shy of removing Johnson from office.

   ATLANTA _ House Judiciary Committee staffers will begin
immediately to gather information, request interviews with
potential witnesses and prepare for public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   --A Judiciary subcommittee will meet Oct. 22 to debate what is
an impeachable offense. Other than that, little public action is
expected until after the Nov. 3 congressional elections.
</P>

   --Formal hearings will begin after the elections. The witness

be done by the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   --If a majority of the House votes to impeach the president, a
trial would be conducted in the Senate, with Chief Justice William
Rehnquist presiding. It takes a two-thirds vote of the Senate to
remove the president from office.

MARKETS' PILINGS OF STABILITY DRIFT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For six weeks, investors have lulled themselves into thinking
that the worst might be over, that the selloff that had racked
financial markets around the world had largely run its course.
While times might still be tough, the prices of stocks, bonds and
other financial assets had largely taken the bad news into account.
</P>
<P>
   That illusion cracked Thursday as the value of the dollar
remained low, interest rates rose and the prices of hundreds of
stocks plunged even as the main stock market gauges showed minimal
losses. One after another, the pilings that have lent a measure of
stability to the markets over the last several weeks have been
swept away.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, things might not look so bad: the Dow Jones
industrial average, the stock market bellwether, finished the day a
mere 9.78 points lower, at 7,731.91. But beneath that relatively
calm result was a day of turmoil during which the Dow fell as much
as 274 points before climbing back in the last two hours of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Even greater damage occurred in the Nasdaq composite index,
which measures the performance of many of the fastest-growing
technology companies. The index dropped 43.49 points, or nearly 3
percent, to 1,419.12 _ its lowest closing price in 16 months. Over
the last two weeks alone, the Nasdaq index has fallen nearly 20
percent _ a spectacular implosion in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   That greater upheaval reflects a significant shift in the mood
of many investors on Wall Street and around the globe. Gone are the
expectations, analysts said, that the United States can avoid the
economic slowdown that has already gripped much of the world. While
many economists on Wall Street still call a recession unlikely, the
fact that they are including its potential in their forecasts means
that most bets of continued unbridled expansion are off.
</P>
<P>
   Also washing away are some of the last remaining expectations of
brisk growth in corporate profits, of companies using much of their
excess cash to buy back their own shares, and of individual
investors riding to the rescue and buying more stocks each time the
market dips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more confusion in the marketplace now than I've ever
seen in my career,'' said Henry Herrmann, president and chief
investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed Financial, a mutual fund
company based in Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of confusion has just got the vast majority of
portfolio managers cross-eyed,'' said Herrmann, who has worked in
the investment business since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the situations that have confused him and others is
the ``flight to quality'' that has taken place among stock and bond
investors. The shift has left blue-chip stocks and U.S. Treasury
bonds performing relatively well while every other category of
assets has been hammered.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victims have been the highly visible Nasdaq stocks,
whose steep fall stems in large part from heavy selling by foreign
investors. Those investors have been some of the biggest buyers of
American stocks over the last two years as the value of the dollar
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with the dollar reversing its course and becoming
cheaper in relation to the yen, the mark and other foreign
currencies, overseas investors are finding that not only are their
American stocks worth less, but they also get less of their home
currency for each dollar when they convert their investments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, those Americans who have come to expect a U.S.
recession have begun to measure its possible effect on technology
companies. Those manufacturers that sell equipment to businesses in
America and around the world are more likely to be hurt by an
economic slowdown than are the large consumer product companies
that make up much of the Dow industrial index.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a slowdown in the purchase of capital goods by
companies, the technology companies will be affected more
dramatically than a lot of the blue chips,'' said Robert Freedman,
chief investment officer at the John Hancock Funds. ``At the same
time, people will still be eating and drinking and going to the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Several specific events also led traders to take a decidedly
dimmer view of things on Thursday. First, the Bank of England cut
its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, to 7.25 percent.
But much as with the quarter-point cut in rates by the Federal
Reserve last week, equity traders and analysts judged the move to
be too little to aid slowing economies around the world,
particularly in Europe. Financial markets in Europe fell sharply,
with the major stock indexes down 2.7 percent in Britain and 5
percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates generally rose Thursday, with the yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbing to just below 5 percent,
up from 4.72 percent on Monday. In addition, short-term rates have
fallen below long-term rates in the days since the Federal Reserve
cut its benchmark rate. The level of short-term rates generally
indicates that bond traders expect further cuts by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. stock markets, two influential analysts adjusted
their outlooks, further adding to the market's gloom. Abby Joseph
Cohen, the investment analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. who has been
the market's most voluble cheerleader over the last three years,
made comments about corporate earnings growth that to many
listeners had a slightly negative tone.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Cohen did not throw in the towel on her relentlessly
optimistic forecast, she at least threw in a washcloth, cutting her
estimates of 1998 and 1999 earnings for the companies in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, implying that the current
economic squeeze would extend well into next year.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Acampora, who tracks market indexes and other statistical
measures at Prudential Securities, also lowered his estimate of how
low the Dow might fall.
</P>
<P>
   It was Acampora who caused a stampede out of stocks in early
August, when the Dow industrials were still above 8,700, with his
prediction of a bear market. Thursday, he said he thought the Dow
would trade as low as 6,700, well below his previous floor of
7,400. To get to that level, the Dow would have to fall more than
13 percent from Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Greg Smith, Prudential's chief investment strategist
and a colleague of Acampora's, recommended that investors increase
their cash holdings to 20 percent of assets from 5 percent. Most of
that cash, he said, should be raised by lowering bond investments
to 25 percent of a portfolio from 35 percent, with stock
investments falling to 55 percent from 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two other stabilizing factors also appear to be gone from
beneath the relatively calm surface of the stock market. Mutual
fund investors, who have lent the stock market a strong measure of
stability for the last four years, demonstrated in August _ the
last time the market fell sharply _ that they will withdraw money
from stock funds when performance turns down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with small stocks continuing to fall sharply, financial
analysts say that funds specializing in shares of small companies
are experiencing growing levels of investor withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Also, traders speak of fears that one more remaining source of
liquidity for the stock market is drying up: corporate stock
repurchases. With credit becoming harder to come by for many
companies, those corporations that have been actively buying back
shares to finance option packages and for other uses might be less
likely to spend any spare cash they have, at least over the short
run.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves many traders fearful that the stock market will get
more choppy, with big swings during the day, like Thursday's,
becoming even more common. Investors, they say, should be ready for
more choppy seas.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Institute of Peace may have to fight war
with a few board members missing in action. The Civil Liberties
Public Education Fund and the Museum Services Board may have to
educate and archive without a full roster of top officials.
</P>
<P>
   And numerous federal courts will surely have to adjudicate with
fewer judges, while the Food and Drug Administration will continue
to regulate with a commissioner who is just acting.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate prepares to adjourn for the rest of the year, it
has yet to vote on 225 Clinton administration nominees for full-
and part-time jobs, including dozens who have been approved by
Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican aides said many appointees were likely
to be confirmed in a traditional, last-minute rush of voting before
the Senate left. But others, particularly many prominent nominees,
seized on as proxies in long-running policy battles between the
White House and Congress, are likely to fall victim to objections
by specific senators, for reasons including distaste for gay
politics, a dispute over statistical methods and opposition to a
pill that induces abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional aides say some nominees have languished
for lack of pressure from the White House, which is trying to get a
budget passed and deal with impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, of the 225 administration nominations pending in the
Senate, 75 have been approved by various committees, the White
House said. Some have been pending since this Congress began in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Senate has approved 191 administration candidates.
Thursday, it confirmed four judges, including one hotly disputed
nominee, William Fletcher, to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in San Francisco. Fletcher, whom some Republicans
criticized as liberal, was nominated in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said Fletcher was confirmed only
after vigorous lobbying and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been really putting a lot of pressure on them to
confirm our nominees,'' this official said, ``and we've nominated a
number of their folks recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 54 people nominated for judgeships are awaiting
confirmation by the Senate, while another 47 have been confirmed
this year. Democrats accuse Republicans of stalling in hopes of a
Republican administration in two years, while Republicans argue
that many of President Clinton's choices are too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees are mired in disputes raging along Pennsylvania
Avenue. Kenneth Prewitt, the candidate to be director of the
census, is being held up by Republicans seeking to block
administration plans to use a new statistical method, rather than a
strict head count, to help ascertain the population.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have all but given up on some
appointees, including James Hormel, the president's nominee to be
ambassador to Luxembourg. An heir to the Hormel meat-packing
fortune and former dean of the University of Chicago Law School,
Hormel, who is gay, has financially supported a number of gay
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel was nominated just over a year ago, but several
Republican senators have blocked his confirmation, saying that they
were concerned that he had promoted a gay agenda or lifestyle.
</P>

   One senator can block a nomination by simply putting a ``hold''

   Jane Henney, Clinton's pick to fill the top job in the FDA, is
an example of how administration dawdling has combined with Senate
resistance to leave some senior posts unfilled for months or years.
After Dr. David Kessler resigned as commissioner in February 1997,
the administration waited until late June to send up the nomination
of Dr. Henney, a former deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   By a voice vote Sept. 23, the Labor and Human Resources
Committee recommended the nomination to the full Senate for
confirmation. But several Republicans, including Sen. Don Nickles
of Oklahoma, have blocked it from going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Simmons, a spokesman for Nickles, said, ``There is a great
suspicion or fear that she has somewhat of a propensity to
legislate by regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said some senators feared that Dr. Henney favored too
free a hand for the agency in regulating tobacco. Further, he said,
when she was deputy commissioner, the agency recruited companies to
market the abortion drug RU-486 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lauri Boeder, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and
Human Services, said Dr. Henney ``was not involved with anything
having to do with the approval process of RU-486, nor was she
involved with the tobacco issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boeder said Dr. Henney had ``a profound respect for the role
of Congress'' and was eager to carry out Congress' plans to
modernize the agency.

 &HT;    Georgia lawmaker plays wildcard against expectations
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It came as no surprise Thursday that all eight
Republicans in the Georgia delegation voted to open an impeachment
inquiry into allegations against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat unexpected, however, that Democratic Rep.
Sanford Bishop, the wildcard vote, decided against supporting the
GOP resolution.
</P>
<P>
   As the only member facing a serious election challenge in a
conservative district, many expected Bishop to support the
Republican measure calling for an open-ended inquiry into
allegations that Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice and
abused his presidential powers in an attempt to conceal his affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bishop stuck with his Democratic brethren and voted
against a Republican resolution, which passed, 258 to 176.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been politically expedient, and voted for the
Republican resolution,'' Bishop said in a statement after the vote.
``But I could not in good conscience put my personal and political
interests ahead of the well-being of the people of the second
district and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But political factors may not have been entirely absent from
Bishop's decision, however, The second district is more than
one-third black. Blacks have overwhelmingly said in public opinion
polls that they do not favor an continuing investigation of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's other Democrats, Reps. John Lewis and Cynthia McKinney
bucked their party and voted against the Democratic alternative --
in effect saying no to any type of impeachment inquiry on the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has had enough,'' said Lewis, who as chief deputy
whip refused to help his party leaders garner support for an
alternative because even it ``went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a stinging rebuke that she delivered against the
president only three weeks ago, McKinney on Thursday said the
president's conduct does not rise to the level of an impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The facts, McKinney said, boil down to this: a man cheated on
his wife and lied to his wife and the the nation about the his
relationship. Impeachment proceedings, should be reserved for the
most serious of crimes and lying about sex does not rise to that
level, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process passed by the House of Representatives today is
nothing more than a sex witch hunt _ a wide-ranging investigation
with no limits, no rules and no time completion,'' McKinney said.
``The Republicans seem hell-bent to investigate rather than
legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lewis, McKinney said that he president has been punished
enough by having to look at himself every day in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Republican support for the impeachment inquiry was widely
anticipated, and all eight Georgia Republicans were already on
record supporting an inquiry before Thursday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.) was quick to note that 430 House
members, both Republican and Democratic, voted for some type of
impeachment inquiry. The parties differed only on how the inquiry
should be framed, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's resounding answer by members of both parties was that
the House must fulfill its constitutional responsibility to
investigate the president's actions and determine if he has
committed 'high crimes and misdemeanors,''' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) joined Democratic calls that the
inquiry be concluded quickly. ``We cannot continue down this track
for much longer,'' Chambliss said. ``It must come to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nathan Deal (R-Ga.), a former prosecutor from north
Georgia, said the inquiry should be approached with ``care and
caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, (R-Ga.), who is also a member of leadership,
said the country is going through a grieving process over the
president's admitted lie about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the nation is still in denial and wants it to go
away,'' Linder said. ``But this is starting to sink in.''

ALOU NO MIRACLE WORKER
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-LBPT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Bob (Don't Call Me Rocky) Graziano was propped up by
Rupert Murdoch's top local executives, Peter Chernin and Chase
Carey, to be their top Dodger stooge, the organization has inspired
more laughs than a Jay Leno monologue and made more bumbling
decisions than a Russian economist.
</P>
<P>
   They claim Graziano and his hand-picked toady, Kevin Malone, are
now minding the Dodger operation, but I swear Laurel &AMP; Hardy have
been resurrected and are in charge of dispensing histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, forget a moment the mindless Mike Piazza trade, or the
mid-season cashiering of Bill Russell and Fred Claire, or the first
dumping of loyal Dodger coaches like Mark Cresse and Reggie Smith,
or the second dumping of loyal Dodger coaches like Manny Mota and
Joey Amalfitano, or the demotion of interim manager Glenn Hoffman
despite his 47-41 record, or other such brainless indiscretions
that I'm sure has Walter O'Malley doing cartwheels in his casket.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of anything more hilarious than the current
spectacle of Laurel &AMP; Hardy err Graziano &AMP; Malone scurrying down to
the Dominican Republic to beg 63-year-old Felipe Alou to accept
their multimillion dollar offer to manage the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Alou?!
</P>
<P>
   Oh wow, he's the answer to all the Dodger problems the lack of a
first-class center fielder, the lack of a catcher who can hit, the
lack of a legitimate third baseman, the lack of a marquee pitcher,
the lack of a reliable relief pitcher, the lack of a first-class
shortstop, the total lack of team chemistry, etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Please!
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against Felipe Alou. Actually, he was one of my
favorite players when I spent a good portion of my teenage years
passionately rooting for the San Francisco Giants. And I'm sure
he's done commendable work with a Montreal Expo team long hampered
by financial shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   But he's no miracle-worker, no genius, no divine savior whose
presence in Los Angeles will magically transform the Dodgers into a
pennant contender.
</P>
<P>
   If Malone is serious about upgrading the Dodgers, he should have
retained Hoffman and invested all those millions he's willing to
blow on Alou to acquire a quality free agent in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Malone, in a typical grandstanding maneuver of flying
all the way to Santo Domingo, reportedly offered the Dodger
managerial job to that self-styled genius, Jim Leyland, whose
superior knowledge and deft insights resulted in 54 victories
against only 108 defeats for the Florida Marlins this season.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Leyland rebuffed Malone's overture, so Malone has decided
to go after Alou, a nice man who reportedly has voiced private
reservations about going to work for the Dodgers with Tom Lasorda
looming in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered guy is being blamed for everything these days
short of Hurricane Georges and Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   And I find that reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   I still like Tommy Lasorda, even though he has instituted a
fatwa
</P>
<P>
   against me in the wake of my printing those harsh anti-Lasorda
quotes from Bill Russell after Russell was fired.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if Kevin Malone is determined to turn the Dodger
manager's office into Leisure World, why doesn't he show some real
courage and bring back Tommy Lasorda?
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda hasn't exactly hidden his desire to manage again, and
he's an established name with a proven record, even a Hall of Famer
with four National League pennants and two World Series titles to
his credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda is every bit the manager Felipe Alou is, and he's
only eight years older. ..
</P>
<P>
   Will someone explain to me in detail why UCLA's top rusher,
Jermaine Lewis, has been suspended for Saturday night's game
against Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA would only reveal that Lewis got into a fight, and that the
guy he was fighting with wound up with stitches and wound up
reporting the beef to campus police.
</P>
<P>
   But everything else is shrouded in typical big-time collegiate
athletic cover-up murk, except for the inevitable
my-guy-says-he's-innocent comments from the suspended athlete's
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Is Jermaine Lewis a malevolent instigator, or an innocent
victim?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that notorious stonewalling UCLA athletic director,
Pious Peter (Principle) Dalis knows, but the public certainly
doesn't. And doesn't the public have a right to know, since it,
after all, UCLA is a state-subsidized university?. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've seen bonehead plays by baseball players before, but none
more outrageous than the one committed Wednesday by the New York
Yankees' second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who allowed the Cleveland
Indians to score what turned out to be the game's winning run in
the 12th inning on a play in which became too preoccupied with
arguing with the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be surprised if the suddenly quite mortal Yankees, who
badly miss the potent bat of Darryl Strawberry, are able to come
back from Knoblauch's unforgivable folly against the resilient
Indians. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've seen bad umpiring but Ted Hendry's erratic work behind the
plate in that second Yankee-Indian game was the worst I've ever
seen. ...
</P>
<P>
   I always get the distinct impression that no one enjoys
listening to Bob Costas work a baseball game more than Bob Costas.
...
</P>
<P>
   This San Diego Padre team has a resolute toughness that the
Atlanta Braves notably lack. ...
</P>
<P>
   Please, anything, another recycled Don Rickles joke from Tom
Lasorda, a TV reprise of Todd Donoho, even a handshake from Al
Davis, rather than the Padres and Indians in the World Series,
which indeed might happen to tarnish what has been a glorious
baseball season. ...
</P>
<P>
   Swimming great Susie Atwood phoned the other tell to say that
superstar maitre d' Dancing Barry Clifford wants his many followers
and my readers to know that he's shifting from Kelly's to
Spaghettini's but doesn't want it known that he inspired Susie to
call me with such an epic revelation. OK, I'll keep it a secret.
...
</P>
<P>
   I watched the Poly-Fontana game on Fox last Thursday in its
entirety, and I don't see how the nation's No. 1 rated high school
team, De LaSalle of Concord, could keep up with Poly's incredible
speed that is superior to most major college teams. ...
</P>
<P>
   Oh, If Only Kenneth Starr Knew Dept.: ``Can you believe I might
wind up facing greater punishment than President Clinton?'' said a
solemn John Morris the other day, the Mum's proprietor whose
establishment faces a 45-day suspension from Alcoholic Beverage
Control for staging a smoker a couple of years ago in which a
couple of ladies performed illegal lap dances.
</P>
<P>
   How awful! But why shut Morris' joint down for 45 days and
deprive 60 workers of their income? Why not make a graphic example
of Bobby Rahal's best friend and the Florenz Ziegfeld of Pine
Avenue (I mistakenly referred to Morris the other day as the Andrew
Lloyd Webber of that great thoroughfare when, instead, I meant to
compare him to the founder of Ziegfeld Follies). Why not close off
Pine Avenue and string Jolly John Morris up on a lamppost and stone
him for such a heinous crime against nature?
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous!
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't the ABC have enough to worry about these tense hours
with all those terrible smoking violators than to turn John Morris
into a modern day Sacco &AMP; Venzetti?. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't bet, but I'd take UCLA and lay the 6{ if I did against
the Wildcats. ...
</P>
<P>
   Yes, And He Also Returned A Louis XIV Bed Because It Was Too
Small, And Asked For A Louis XV Dept.: Wise guy Lakewood Mall
Jewelry Connection jokester Kevin (Dizzy) Diehm, on Chuck
Knoblauch's gaffe: ``His biggest stumbling block is the one under
his hat.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Opposites indeed do attract, for if there ever was a person just
the opposite of me, it's my beloved Brit, so insufferably prim and
proper, so disgustedly fair-minded and honest, so intolerably naive
and innocent, so incomprehensibly sober and understanding that I
know I've been touched by an angel a year after walking down the
altar of eternal bliss. ...

JENKINS SOARS OVER SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As local columnists weigh in on whether it was the greatest play
in the 100-year history of University of Arizona football, and as
it's shown on national TV over and over, and as U of A professors
begin their classes with a discussion about it, Gracie Jenkins
rather sheepishly has a confession to make.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't see it happen.
</P>
<P>
   As her only child, Ortege, was soaring over Seattle on Saturday
night his team's fate and his own well-being very much up in the
air Gracie was at a girlfriend's home in Long Beach, unable to
summon up the courage to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting on the couch with my head down, my eyes closed
and my hands put together I was praying,'' she said. ``Now, we know
God doesn't discriminate, but whatever edge was possible we wanted
to have and I just couldn't bring myself to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friend shouted `All right,' I looked up and saw him in
the end zone. I had to see the replay and when I did, I was glad I
didn't see it (live). All I could think was `Thank God he landed on
his feet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 'Cats always do.
</P>
<P>
   By now everyone has seen the play. Ortege Jenkins drops back to
pass, sees all his receivers covered and then tucks the ball away
and runs up the middle. As he closes in on the goal line, three
Washington players converge on him - free safety Brendan Jones and
linebackers Lester Towns and Marques Hairston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was only one way to get in,'' said Jenkins, a
third-year sophomore from Jordan High.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as he reached the 4-yard line, he closed his eyes and
jumped. The Huskies hit him low, sending Jenkins, who is 6-foot-2,
214 pounds, head over heels. Miraculously he landed on his feet and
importantly it was in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got hit, all I was thinking about was keeping my eyes
closed and making sure I landed on my front side and not my head,''
said Jenkins, whose first name is pronounced Or-TEEj but also
answers to O.J. ``When I hit the turf I didn't know if I got in
until I looked over and saw the side judge signaling touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The stunning play, with four seconds left, lifted Arizona to a
31-28 win over Washington its first win in Seattle in 10 years and
sets up Saturday night's showdown between the No. 10 Wildcats (5-0)
and No.3 UCLA (3-0) in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be the college play of the year,'' said Keith
Smith, with whom Jenkins shares the quarterback job. ``I've never
seen a play like that. That's something you only dream about doing
and it was so clutch. He wanted it way more than the three guys
trying to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   The play capped an 80-yard drive in the final 2:53 in which
Jenkins converted three third-downs with passes and also caught a
22-yard pass the first of his career from Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, though, was sacked at the Washington 9-yard line on
second-and-goal and Arizona was forced to use its final timeout
with 12 seconds left. When Jenkins came to the sidelines, the first
thing coach Dick Tomey told him was to make sure he got two passes
off. In other words, don't run and don't pass to anyone who's not
in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The play was designed to go to the Wildcats' top receiver,
Dennis Northcutt. But he was double covered in the left corner and
not open. The second option was tight end Mike Lucky, who ran a
crossing pattern with Northcutt, but was also covered.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, whose seven-step drop took him back to the 20-yard
line, noticed the middle of the field open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he dropped back there and started to run, it was `Oh, no.
Throw it away,''' said Arizona assistant head coach Duane Akina.
``Then, it's `God
</P>
<P>
   Damn, I love that kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   So what if the play wasn't smart? It was audacious. It was
daring. It was fearless. It was, well, O.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about O.J.,'' said Northcutt. ``He's
unpredictable. He can make the plays, but you don't know what it's
going to be. That's his style it's the kind of person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And always has been, says his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those children you had to watch because he's
never met a stranger without talking to him,'' said Gracie Jenkins.
``We took a trip up north on train when he was a little boy and all
of a sudden he disappeared. I found him in the viewing coach
talking with about four or five men about football. They said,
`This kid really knows the sport.' He's always been outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of sports, where athletes routinely duck reporters
when things don't go well, Jenkins is the anti-Albert Belle he
loves the attention, good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   He approached an Arizona beat writer earlier this season to ask
why he hadn't talked with him after a game in which Jenkins
struggled. And Jenkins has been known to walk off the field
reciting his stats after a scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   When Jenkins was a senior at Jordan, where he was a two-sport
star, he read an item in the Press-Telegram suggesting that
Compton's Jeff Trepagnier, now at USC, was the best leaper in the
Moore League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing Compton the next day,'' said Jenkins. ``Jeff
came down the court and I gave him two lanes to show me what he's
got. I'm saying, `If you're gonna dunk on me, go ahead and dunk on
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins followed Trepagnier up and pinned the ball against the
backboard. A few moments later, Trepagnier had another opportunity.
Again Jenkins blocked it. ``They called a foul on it, but ask
anybody,'' Jenkins said proudly. ``There was no foul.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stood along the foul lane, Jenkins looked over at the
offending reporter and, with his broad smile, pointed to his legs
as if to ask ``Who's got the best hops in the Moore League now?''
</P>
<P>
   It's odd, then, that Jenkins is taken aback by all the attention
his leap has brought.
</P>
<P>
   The play was shown on Monday Night Football. A photo of Jenkins,
upside down in mid-flight, was featured in Sports Illustrated this
week, and he has had dozens of requests for interviews, including
the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have kidded him that he'll win an ESPY for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' Jenkins said. ``I was just out there trying to get
us the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who was a seldom-used reserve on Arizona's top-ranked
basketball team last year, said it is no accident he leaped into
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he tried to go through a pair of Washington State
players, including his former Jordan teammate Lejuan Gibbons, and
was stopped short of the goal line on a two-point conversion on the
final play of Arizona's 35-34 overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big thing letting that happen to myself,'' Jenkins
said. ``I really questioned myself why I didn't get airborne. That
was on my mind, to be honest with you. I knew this time there was
going to be no other way to get in. I just figured I had a chance
to make it happen so I took it, went after it and got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it turned out to be un-flipping believable.

 HOUSE VOTES ALONG PARTY LINES TO BEGIN BROAD IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY  (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH, CLINTON-ASSESS, CLINTON-VOTE,(sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a civil if sometimes harshly phrased debate
that lasted more than three hours, the House of Representatives
voted largely along party lines on Thursday to launch a full-scale,
open-ended inquiry into possible grounds for the impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, which will lead ultimately to another House vote to
decide whether Clinton should stand trial in the Senate, was
authorized by a vote of 258-176, with 31 Democrats breaking ranks
with the president. Some at the White House had feared wholesale
defections. They did not materialize, and from that Clinton could
snatch some shred of consolation, but Thursday's developments
nonetheless deepened the crisis shrouding his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third time in the Republic's 222-year history
that the House had voted such a step, and the Founding Fathers, the
Constitution and the long shadow of precedent were cited by both
sides as the debate unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic representatives complained bitterly that Thursday's
proceeding was unfair because they were given too little time to
speak, and Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, said that so far the
whole process had been ``infected with politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton himself was less confrontational. At a
late-afternoon photo session, he said of his fate: ``It is not in
my hands; it is in the hands of Congress and the people of this
country, ultimately in the hands of God. There is nothing I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   After imploring his fellow members to pay heed to ``that still,
small voice that whispers in our ear, `duty, duty, duty,''' Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
opened the debate by reminding everyone that for now, ``We don't
make any judgments. We don't make any charges. We simply begin the
search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead, he added later, ``is an onerous, miserable,
rotten job.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the Democrats, the House minority leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, said that Clinton `` has deeply disappointed
the American people. He's let us all down.'' But Congress ``must
not compound the hurt,'' Gephardt said, urging his colleagues to
opt for a shorter, narrower investigative process so the American
government could deal with the economic and political problems of
``a dangerous world.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Gephardt said, the country may spend ``three, six,
nine, 12 months, two years, in suspended animation.'' His colleague
in the Democratic leadership, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, raised
the specter of a Congress ``mired in hearings, tangled in testimony
and grinding its gears in partisan stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to recess this weekend for the next three
weeks. During that time, the Judiciary Committee and its staff will
decide a number of strategic questions, such as whether to call
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky as witnesses. Then, after the mid-term
elections on Nov. 3, Hyde said, the hearings will begin.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will send a political signal to Capitol Hill.
According to opinion surveys, the public wants Congress to put the
Clinton controversy behind it. But if the Republicans should gain
four to six seats in the Senate and six to 10 seats in the House,
as electoral analysts think possible, that might give a strong new
impetus to the investigation of the charges brought against Clinton
by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has only seven states on his campaign schedule so far,
an indication of his diminished influence as a leader of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who voted on Thursday with the Republicans
clearly did so because they are locked in close election races and
feared seeming blindly supportive of the president. Among them were
Reps. Leonard Boswell of Iowa, Jim Maloney of Connecticut and Ellen
Tauscher of California.
</P>
<P>
   Others were conservative Southern Democrats, such as Reps.
Charles Stenholm of Texas, Bud Cramer of Alabama and Gene Taylor of
Mississippi. Some of them face difficult re-election fights, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   No votes were necessarily indicative of how members will vote
when the House comes to consider articles of impeachment. Indeed,
that question may not even come before the House as now
constituted. It goes out of existence on Jan. 3, 1999, to be
replaced by the new body that is to be elected next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said again on Thursday that he hoped to finish the House's
work by the end of the year, but he has always been careful not to
make any promises.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Democrats, Reps. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania and Dennis
Kucinich of Ohio, spoke on the floor in open support of the
Republican resolution. The first congressional Democrat to call for
Clinton's resignation, McHale cited Franklin Roosevelt's maxim that
``the presidency is primary a place of moral leadership.'' Clinton,
he said, had lied repeatedly and would still by lying had he not
been confronted ``by a mountain of irrefutable evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the president's statement that his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky was ``inappropriate,'' McHale said it was in fact
``predatory, reckless and breathtakingly arrogant for a man already
a defendant in a sexual harassment suit.''

</P>
<P>
   Two Floridians summed up the sharply differing arguments of the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, a Republican from Lakeland, said that any
conduct by a president that ``undercuts the integrity of office''
constitutes an impeachable offense. Then he asked: ``If perjury and
obstruction of justice do not undermine the integrity of office,
what offense would?''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking next, Rep. Robert Wexler, a Democrat from Boca Raton,
said Congress needed to talk about Kosovo and Saddam Hussein and
overcrowded classrooms and the ``crumbling'' global economy, not
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president betrayed his wife,'' Wexler said. ``He did not
betray the country. God help this nation if we fail to recognize
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one spoke in defense of Clinton's sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Democrats, notably members of the Black Caucus,
who have been among the president's staunchest advocates from the
start, spoke passionately against the Republicans' investigatory
methods and proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters of California denounced the release of
``tawdry and trashy thousands of pages of hearsay, accusations,
gossip and telephone chatter'' that came nowhere close, she said,
to proving impeachable offenses. Rep. Charles Rangel of New York
warned the Republicans that they would not win the November
election ``by hounding the president.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a venerated hero of the civil
rights movement of the 1960s, accused the Republicans of trying to
defeat Clinton through impeachment because they had failed to do so
at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are watching,'' he said angrily, his voice
rising to a shout. ``Beware the wrath of the American people, Mr.
Speaker. Beware!''
</P>
<P>
   Black members were not the only hard hitters. Rep. Nancy Pelosi
of California attacked Republicans for seeking to impeach Clinton
after allowing the speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, to
survive with a mere reprimand for giving false information to the
ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the debate, the House chamber was about a quarter
full, with perhaps 110 members present at any one time. That is
more than attend routine debates, but surprisingly few, considering
the momentousness of the occasion. Staff members milled in the
aisles, chattering, and Gingrich, who was presiding, several times
appealed for order and asked people to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., intervened to suggest that leaders of
both parties ``send out messages to the members that whatever
they're doing they ought to drop it and get their tails in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Decorum never quite collapsed, but there was whistling and
cheering, as well as applause, after some speakers finished their
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the galleries were the country singer Charley
Pride and fromer Rep. Tom Railsback, R-Ill., who played a central
role on the Judiciary Committee when it recommended the impeachment
of President Richard Nixon in 1974.

SMITH, JENKINS MAKE PERFECT PAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>

 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Moments after he survived a gravity defying, head-over-heals,
don't-try-this-at-home touchdown run to beat Washington, Ortege
Jenkins had a much tougher encounter.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to the sidelines, Jenkins was tackled by the man
who wants his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped up and kneed him in the stomach, then I fell down,''
Keith Smith said. ``I didn't know what was going on. Everybody was
going crazy. I couldn't believe he beat Washington on the last play
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As the photo on today's sports front shows there's No.12 in the
background, the first one to celebrate nobody was happier about
Jenkins' touchdown than Smith.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a competition for the quarterback job has
evolved into a job-sharing arrangement that has left Jenkins and
Smith quite content.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey names a starter each week, but both
have split time. Smith has started the last four games and while
his numbers are slightly better, Tomey turned to Jenkins at the end
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``OJ and I truly believe that we can do it together,'' said
Smith, who considered transferring after last season. ``We both
believe in our abilities, but if we treat everything negatively,
we're not going to get anything out of it. Now, we're battling, but
it's more of a team concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have proved themselves as starters.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a junior from Newbury Park, won the job as a freshman and
set a school record by completing 60.6 percent of his passes and
accounted for an NCAA freshman-record 502 yards of total offense
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, a sophomore from Jordan High in Long Beach, took over
last year when Smith was hurt and threw for a Pac-10
freshman-record 19 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great relationship on and off the field - that's why
it works so good,'' Jenkins said. ``We know how to work together.
At first I had my doubts - you always do. But it's good now. I
don't see any reason why anything should be changed because we're
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (5-0) is ranked 10th, its highest since 1994. It's also
worth noting that two of the last three Rose Bowl champions - USC
with Brad Otton and Kyle Wachholtz and Ohio State with Stanley
Jackson and Joe Germaine - have used a two-quarterback system.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, though, has shown the two can co-exist on the same
field. On the Wildcats' winning drive against Washington, Smith
lined up at tailback and Jenkins went in motion. The ball was
snapped to Smith who, displaying the hands of a former minor league
shortstop, scooped it up and fired to Jenkins for a 22-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll do more of that soon,'' said Smith, who
played running back and receiver last season. ``OJ and I will do
whatever it takes. We don't care anything about our stats. We love
winning.''

HUBBLE OFFERS GLIMPSE INTO DAWN OF THE UNIVERSE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peering farther back in space and time than ever before, the
Hubble Space Telescope has taken infrared pictures of what may be
the most distant objects ever detected, early light from the
galactic dawn of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers are not sure, but they think some of the faint
objects could be galaxies formed in the first billion years of
cosmic history, or more than 12 billion years ago. If so, they are
crossing a new frontier of the cosmos, where they hope to find the
very first galaxies and solve the mystery of when and how such
congregations of stars emerged out of the formless dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``These images are the deepest images of distant galaxies that
have ever been obtained,'' Rodger Thompson, a University of Arizona
astronomer, said in announcing the new Hubble telescope findings
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dressler, an astronomer with the Carnegie Observatories in
Pasadena, Calif., agreed that the infrared pictures were ``our
first tentative glimpse into the very remote universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these may represent ``the first stages of galaxy
formation,'' Dressler said, the objects are such faint blobs that
``their true nature can only be explored with the advanced
telescopes of the future.'' He was referring, in particular, to the
more powerful replacement for the Earth-orbiting Hubble telescope
that is being planned for launching in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the
infrared pictures public Thursday at a news conference in
Washington. A catalog of the observed objects and other research
details will be published soon in The Astronomical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In January, using its infrared spectrometer-camera, an
instrument installed by visiting astronauts in early 1997, the
telescope took a 36-hour exposure of a relatively narrow region of
space that had previously been examined in visible and ultraviolet
light. Three years ago, when the Hubble telescope took a 10-day
exposure with its visible-light camera of the same field of view,
astronomers found hundreds of galaxies that had never been seen
before, inspiring them to raise their estimate of the total number
of galaxies in the observable universe to more than 50 billion from
10 billion. The Hubble Deep Field, as the visible photography was
known, had been until now the deepest view of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras sensitive to infrared wavelengths can often penetrate
the dust that obscures many of the most distant cosmic phenomena.
Some of these objects are so far away that their only detectable
light is in the infrared wavelengths. Most galaxies radiate more
infrared light than visible light.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 300 galaxies in the main infrared picture included
some that had been seen before. But the infrared camera revealed
many new objects, the reddest and faintest of which may be the
earliest galaxies ever detected. Astronomers said the distant
galaxies seemed to be smaller than those from more recent epochs.
But they said it was not yet possible to determine if the galaxies
were truly small or whether these were merely the cores of larger
structures that could not be seen at these distances.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the principal scientist working with the infrared
instrument's observations, estimated that the most-distant objects
in the picture dated back to when the universe was 5 percent of its
present age. That age is still a matter of debate, but some of the
most recent data and theoretical models indicate that the universe
began about 13 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we have found new objects means we really have
reached the edge'' of the universe, Thompson said. That is, the
observations take astronomers close to the time when matter in the
early universe first coalesced into stars and the stars clustered
in galaxies. How this happened is one of the great unknowns of
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the results, Thompson also found that faint red
galaxies matched up with compact blue knots of light that had been
seen in the earlier visible photography of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that some objects that appeared to be separate
galaxies in the optical image are really hot star-forming regions
in much larger older galaxies,'' he said.

THE EXTRAORDINARY NOW HAS BECOME ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: In 11th paragraph, corrects year of Republican ascendancy in
House to 1994.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The debate has sharpened, but Washington's
capacity for shock has dulled.
</P>
<P>
   And so the House's formal decision Thursday to undertake
impeachment hearings for only the third time in the nation's
history _ to begin, as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.
Hyde of Illinois put it, ``a search for the truth'' _ provided no
surprise, prompted no gasps of astonishment, set forth few ripples
in the country or the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In nine months, the extraordinary has become ordinary; the
historic, routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sex with an intern in the White House, the erosion of
centuries-old presumptions about the presidency and presidential
privilege, the release of grand-jury testimony that in any other
case would be sealed forever, the conclusion by an independent
counsel that a twice-elected president of the United States
``criminally obstructed the judicial process,'' the broadcast of
taped presidential testimony about genital contact _ any one of
them in any other year would be cause for consternation, even
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in less than a year's time, each of them has become
front-page news, the salacious and the serious mixing in a toxic
brew that has contaminated public life, endangered venerable
institutions and alienated the governing class from the public it
is meant to serve.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Thursday's the debate in the House chamber offered
one of those rare moments, seldom occurring more than once a
decade, when the lawmakers' speeches were high-minded and
high-toned, delivered for the verdict of the voters and for
history. The tone was sober, the proceedings grave, the result
portentous.
</P>
<P>
   And as the lawmakers cast their votes, there was the
unmistakable recognition that a barrier was being breached, that
the 435 men and women who had grown accustomed to casting ballots
on appropriations bills and deregulation initiatives were suddenly
about to tread on different, forbidding ground. A president and the
presidency hung in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the similarities between Thursday and the last
time such a resolution was debated end.
</P>
<P>
   There was a partisan edge to what Democratic Representative
Charles E. Schumer of New York called ``a serious and solemn day''
on Capitol Hill, and that foreshadowed a bitter fight once the
House Judiciary Committee opens deliberations on actual
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Watergate days, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter
W. Rodino Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, labored long and carefully to
win the confidence of moderate Republicans, an achievement that
lent legitimacy to the assault on Nixon and eventually led to the
president's resignation. But there is no middle ground in the
Judiciary Committee, nor in the House.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republican rebels stormed the gates of the House in
1994, the casualties weren't the Democratic liberals the newcomers
assailed, but the Democratic moderates who were in closely balanced
congressional districts. The GOP revolution did more than replace
Democrats with Republicans. It removed the middle ground from the
House. The new House was at once more conservative and more liberal
than the old House.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 105th Congress is about to become known as the
Impeachment Congress, much as the 93rd Congress was. But the road
to impeachment is easier to tread today because it was traveled so
recently.
</P>
<P>
   For 106 years between the administrations of Andrew Johnson and
Richard M. Nixon, Congress battled with the White House, fighting
over spending priorities, struggling over wars, bickering over
treaties, sometimes even questioning the motives and morals of the
chief executive _ but never resorting to the ultimate step of
trying to impeach the president until the Watergate scandal
convulsed the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a quarter-century after the last impeachment drama,
Congress is doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawmakers who will determine the destiny of
President Clinton _ including Representatives John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan and Charles B. Rangel of New York, both Democrats, and
Senators Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and Paul S.
Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland _ played major roles in the
near-impeachment of Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Watergate crisis, the impeachment hearings, the
Nixon resignation and the ascension of President Ford are all
within the lifetime of every lawmaker on Capitol Hill. None of the
principals in Watergate _ Senators Howard H. Baker Jr. and Sam
Ervin, Representatives M. Caldwell Butler, Barbara C. Jordan,
Robert McClory, Tom Railsback and Rodino _ had any personal memory
of the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. For all of them,
impeachment was an arcane procedure, inserted in the Constitution
to be used almost never.
</P>
<P>
   But the weapon, used in the past with trembling hands, has been
unsheathed twice within memory. Thursday the House picked it up
again. Like so much else after this year of upheaval, impeachment
is not a taboo anymore.

HARE KRISHNA MOVEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES CHILD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Vt., Texas, Wash., W.Va., Fla., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its own official journal, the Hare Krishna movement has
published an unusually candid expose detailing widespread physical,
emotional and sexual abuse of children who were sent to live in the
group's boarding schools in the United States and India in the
1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were often unaware of the abuse because they were
traveling around soliciting donations for their guru's books, in
airports and on the streets, leaving their children in the care of
Hare Krishna monks and young devotees who had no training in
educating children and often resented the task, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's leadership was first forced to confront the
victims of abuse at a meeting in May 1996, when a panel of 10
former Krishna pupils testified that they had been regularly beaten
and caned at school, denied medical care and sexually molested and
raped homosexually at knife point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being made to sleep naked in a cold bathtub for a
month,'' Jahnavi Dasi, 26, who was sent to a Krishna boarding
school in Los Angeles at age 4, said in an interview Thursday. ``I
had wet my bed, and it was easier for them to make me sleep in the
tub than to change my sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dasi also told the leadership meeting in 1996 that she wound
up in a diabetic coma for three weeks after her teachers insisted
that her health problems were a ruse to avoid cleaning the school
and chanting in the temple. ``They neglected to take me to a
doctor, so I ended up in a coma,'' at which time she was taken to a
hospital, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hare Krishna movement, a Hindu sect brought to the United
States by the Indian guru A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami in the 1960s, is
now acknowledging that the legacy of abuse and the leadership's
failure to grapple with it earlier have led many Hare Krishna
children and their parents in this country to abandon the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people don't trust the leadership,'' E. Burke Rochford
Jr., a sociologist of religion at Middlebury College in Vermont,
the author of one of the two studies published in the most recent
Krishna journal, said Thursday. ``They don't trust the movement,
and people have become estranged as a consequence. The children who
in all probability would have been more likely to embrace the
movement in the long term, some of them have withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement now claims an estimated 90,000 followers in the
United States, of whom only about 800 live full time in the group's
45 American spiritual communities, called ashrams. At the
movement's peak in the United States in the late 1970s, about
10,000 devotees lived in American ashrams, but most now live and
work in the secular world. Another significant shift is that where
once the movement in the United States consisted almost entirely of
Anglo converts to Hinduism, about half of the people now
worshipping in Krishna temples in the United States are recent
immigrants from India and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Krishna movement has experienced its
biggest growth in Eastern Europe and in India, where it was once
regarded with disdain by native Hindus. Internationally, there are
now an estimated 1 million adherents to the Hare Krishna movement,
known formally as ISKCON, or the International Society of Krishna
Consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Public revelations of sexual abuse by clergymen have plagued
religious groups from the Roman Catholic Church to the United
Methodist Church in the last decade. But it is rare for a religious
organization to choose to disclose the extent and causes of
systemic child abuse in its official publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get to the bottom of it,'' said Anuttama Dasa, the
North American director of communications for ISKCON, ``and to the
best of our ability do whatever we can to try to repair the damage
to the kids and show them we do care as a religious society.''
</P>
<P>
   Several schools with dedicated, loving teachers avoided any
allegations of abuse, Rochford wrote. But severe sexual and
physical abuse was common at the gurukulas, as Krishna boarding
schools are called, in India, where many American adherents sent
their adolescent boys. When children tried to send letters home
sharing their misery, some schools in India censored the letters,
Rochford said. The highest levels of abuse in American gurukulas
were reported in Dallas, Seattle and New Vrindaban, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the movement established a Child Protection Office in
Alachua, Fla., the site of one of the most thriving Krishna
communities remaining. The office helps Krishna temple leaders
identify and prevent further abuse, investigates cases of past
abuse, and reports them to local law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several lawsuits arising from child abuse cases
at Krishna schools in Alachua and in New Vrindaban, W.Va., but they
do not approach the number or scope of such cases brought against
the Roman Catholic Church, which recently paid $30 million to
settle a case of sexual abuse by a clergyman against several boys
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a surprising lack of suits up until now,''
Rochford said, ``for reasons I don't fully understand.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The editor of the ISKCON Communications Journal asked Rochford
to write an article chronicling the history and causes of abuse at
Krishna boarding schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's highly unusual,'' Rochford said in an interview.
``I was surprised that I was asked to do the article, and I had
some reservations about doing it in an ISKCON journal. After so
many years studying the movement, I knew this was going to be
painful for people to endure.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the abuse lay in the very culture and structure
of the early Krishna movement, Rochford said in his article. The
movement drew very young devotees, many in their late teens and
early 20s. Those who were not successful proselytizing and
collecting contributions on the street were put to work in the
movement's boarding schools. There was no screening of teacher
candidates, no training, little financial support, high turnover
and often as many as 20 students per teacher, the article reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of the time was that distributing the guru's
books and engaging oneself in missionary activity was the most
important service that one could be involved in,'' Rochford said in
the interview. ``People's status within the movement was very much
based on their ability to be effective in those tasks. Family, the
way we see present in most Christian traditions, was not valued in
the same way. Sexuality and family were something for those that
were spiritually weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Celibacy was the ideal, the article said. But to accommodate
families, the movement's founder asked the Krishna temples in the
United States to set up boarding schools modeled on the gurukulas,
or Hindu schools, in India. The goal was to immerse students in the
spiritual life, which Swami Bhaktivedanta taught meant cutting the
``ropes of affection'' between parent and child, Rochford wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Children were sent to the gurukulas as early as age 3 or 4, and
visited with their parents as seldom as once a month, or even once
a semester. From 1975 to 1978, 11 Krishna schools opened in the
United States and Canada, with regional schools in Lake Huntington,
N.Y., and central California.
</P>
<P>
   The movement no longer maintains boarding schools in the United
States, and many Krishna families now send their children to public
schools. But some Krishna temples do run day schools for students.
</P>
<P>
   Jahnavi Dasi, who remembers being forced to sleep in a bathtub,
still believes in the Krishna philosophy, and sends her 5-year-old
son to a Krishna kindergarten in Alachua. But unlike her mother,
who was a Krishna missionary, Ms. Dasi lives in her own house,
earning her living running a computer business with her husband.
Every day, she picks up her son from kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that I'm here, I'm aware of what's
happening, I'm monitoring the school, and making sure my son is
protected,'' Ms. Dasi said. ``I wouldn't send him away somewhere
else.''

   JEZERSKA RANGE, Yugoslavia _ Three days after the U.N. Security
Council called on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
halt his shelling against civilians in Kosovo, Nakije Halili
remembers hearing the sound of artillery across the valley.
</P>
<P>
   She knew nothing about the earnest motions in faraway New York,
but she immediately fathomed the close-in thuds.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months pregnant, she stumbled with her 75-year-old
mother-in-law, Tahire, and her husband, Sinan, into the woods that
Saturday morning. Two days later a son, Lirim, now a tightly
wrapped bundle in his mother's arms, was born on the ground in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   On the same morning Elfije Kadriaj, 13, who has been paralyzed
most of her life from an early illness, was heaved into her
wheelchair and pushed across fields by her brother Rajip, 16. On
Thursday, Elfije sat in her wheelchair under a tree on the edge of
a tractor-trailer refugee camp as raindrops sprinkled on her.
</P>
<P>
   Extended families with great-grandparents and babies in cradles
have recreated their lives in a lush green valley splashed with the
colors of turning fall leaves after having been forced to flee
their homes by the final blast of the Serbian military offensive in
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders, the relief agency, says the newest
refugees of the Kosovo crisis are the worst off.
</P>
<P>
   The agency warned in a report to diplomatic monitors that the
refugees had perilously little food and that the carcasses of
animals shot by the troops threatened creek water that is used for
drinking, cooking and washing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike longer-term refugees the new contingent has had no time
to put up reinforced tents with wooden floors. They sleep with
eight to 10 people sandwiched in open-air trailers covered with
flimsy swaths of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive against separatist guerrillas and their supporters
that started here the weekend after the Security Council resolution
was the last in a series of three operations that started in
Pudujevo, north of the provincial capital, Pristina, continued
through the Cicavica hills and swept through here.
</P>
<P>
   The operations by the Yugoslav army and Serbian police were
intended to finish off the guerrillas after a three-month push in
which Milosevic has tried to punish the ethnic Albanian population,
who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1, in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians are seeking independence from Serbia, the dominant
of the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Thursday that the offensive had affected
civilians far more gravely than it had the armed and uniformed
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share what we can with the refugees,'' said one guerrilla,
armed with an AK-47 rifle and dressed against the damp in a shiny
new hooded poncho emblazoned with a ``Chicago Bulls'' insignia over
his camouflage uniform. Three colleagues at the side of the road
wore similar gear.
</P>
<P>
   Along the rocky trail that led up the mountain from the village
of Petrovo, guerrillas emerged from the woods to check identity
papers and consult with the refugees. A well-positioned trench line
used by the guerrillas to see over a valley was easily visible at
the roadside. There were several dugouts camouflaged with branches.
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear that the refugees, particularly families from
the village of Budakao, were intimidated from going home by an
encampment of Serbian police officers on the opposite ridge at
lower Krusica.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Rame Kokollari, 56, visited his house Thursday in Budakovo
for the third time since he ran for his life that Saturday morning,
he was overcome with emotion. The two-story, whitewashed structure,
by far the newest and grandest in the ancient village, had two
chimney pots standing but no roof. The upstairs was reduced to
rubble, and the downstairs was thoroughly looted of furniture. A
wing of guest rooms was demolished. The television set was gone,
but the aerial was left standing.
</P>
<P>
   There was another reason that he was so upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days after the Serbs left, I came to get my mother and
father,'' Kokollari said. They had stayed, he added, because they
believed that the Serbian police would leave old people alone.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned he found his father, Hasan, 84, dead, he said,
shot in the left cheek and lying on the muddy earth a few hundred
yards from the house. The father had apparently been shot to death
and fallen to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kokollari's mother, Ajshe, 86, had been left alone with her
husband's body.
</P>
<P>
   Too scared to bury his father in daylight, Kokollari said, he
went back to the refugee camp with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He returned six days later to dig a shallow grave for his
father, now covered with a loose mound of earth a few yards from
where he was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buried him at night,'' Kokollari said. ``The village
graveyard is too far away, and I'd be vulnerable to snipers if I
walked along that road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring village of Krusica, the stone farmhouse where
the paralyzed girl, Elfije Kadriaj, lived, was left untouched by
the pillaging soldiers. Chickens roamed the yard searching for
food.
</P>
<P>
   But up the rocky street Haki Kadriaj, 56, had returned to
inspect his ruined house. The windows were blown out. The roof and
doors were off. The electric wires for all the houses had been cut.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday an ad hoc emergency council of villagers that seemed
to work in cooperation with the guerrillas had decided to pick up
and burn the cow carcasses. The council had also made a decision,
at least in principle, Hajrullah Halili said as he adjusted a rope
on the back of a tractor to haul away a carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international organizations have to guarantee our safety
before we return to our villages,'' Halili said. ``If we don't have
a guarantee from an international organization we should not go
back and should not rebuild, because they will only burn again.''

U.S. EMBARKS ON ANOTHER ROUND OF TALKS WITH YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KOSOVO-REFUGEES)  
(js) 
 BY ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a delicate dance of diplomacy and threats, the
Clinton administration on Thursday embarked on yet another round of
negotiations with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic while
accusing him of ``cosmetic gestures'' that would not be enough to
head off NATO air strikes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke was dispatched back to
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to try again after three days of largely
fruitless talks with the Yugoslav leader that ended on Wednesday.
The negotiations so far, a senior official said, had been ``the
grimmest ever'' between the two men _ a bleak description given
their often bitter wrangling over ways to end the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Milosevic now
had ``but a few days''to withdraw about 15,000 Yugoslav Army
soldiers from Kosovo along with large number of special police
units or face military action from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also issued a warning Thursday. ``We would far
prefer to secure President Milosevic's compliance with the will of
the international community in a peaceful manner,'' he said. ``But
NATO must be prepared to act militarily to protect our interests
and to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has not won agreement on military strikes
from other NATO countries. Several NATO governments _ among them
Germany, Italy and Denmark _ are still hesitant about undertaking
alliance military action without an explicit Security Council
mandate, which appears almost impossible to get.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she was confident that if Milosevic continued to
prevaricate, all NATO governments would vote for military action.
However, she did not say when that might happen.
</P>
<P>
   NATO ambassadors meeting in Brussels on Thursday gave final
approval to an operational plan for air strikes worked out by
military commanders in recent weeks, officials said. But a
so-called activation order, the approval needed to put that plan
into action, seems unlikely to be agreed upon until the weekend, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Russia continued on Thursday to oppose any use of force at a
meeting in London of the contact group on Yugoslavia, which
includes the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and
Italy. The members tried to put on a determined show of unity by
formally approving Holbrooke's new mission, and issued a statement
insisting on Milosevic's compliance with a Security Council
resolution passed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's main demands will be those laid out in the
resolution: an end to all military and police operations in Kosovo,
the verifiable withdrawal of forces, free access to Kosovo for
international relief organizations and the opening of negotiations
with Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian community, which accounts for about
90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said Milosevic would
be given an ``ultimatum.'' But U.S. officials studiously avoided
that term, calling it the ``U word,'' and no deadline was set for
the compliance of the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic would be taking a substantial political risk by
accepting Holbrooke's demands. As one senior official remarked
Thursday in a reference to discussions on ending the war in Bosnia,
``he could throw the Croatian Serbs and Bosnian Serbs overboard
when he had to, but abandoning the Kosovo Serbs is unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, the center of Serbia's medieval-era civilization and
site of several exquisite Eastern Orthodox monasteries, is widely
regarded by the Serbs as the womb of their nationhood, a place
whose surrender is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Through emotional exploitation of the region's history and myth
and by quashing the province's autonomy in 1989, Milosevic built
the foundation for his rise to power. The ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo now want more than the autonomy they once had; they want
independence and are using guerrilla tactics in its pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared clear Thursday that America's strategy for ending
the fighting in Kosovo, which has already left more than 250,000
people homeless, was rooted in the attempt to mount an entirely
credible threat of force even as NATO's unity remained less than
complete and Russian opposition to military action vehement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to meet Germany's chancellor-elect, Gerhard Schroder,
in Washington on Friday for talks that will center on overcoming
German concerns. As for Russia, Albright said America hoped to
``work with them on a joint compliance.'' But she added that, ``If
force is necessary, then we will not be deterred by the fact that
the Russians do not agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior diplomat reported a tense exchange during the Contact
Group meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
Albright. The Russian minister expressed his view that Milosevic
was prepared to cooperate, and the secretary of state retorted that
the Yugoslav president was ``a congenital liar''.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said publicly that, ``Time and again, Milosevic has
promised us to do things he had no intention of doing.'' She added:
``Even in the last two weeks, even as he made cosmetic gestures in
the direction of compliance, his forces committed some of the worst
atrocities of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   But after weeks of intense diplomatic effort to reach even the
uncertain degree of Western unity now achieved, it appears unlikely
that the United States would shelve the threat of force. With
winter coming on, it is clear to everyone that this is a last
chance to avoid a season of terrible suffering in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Holbrooke would meet with Milosevic on Friday and
might remain in Belgrade into the weekend. Many U.S. embassy staff
have already been withdrawn from the Yugoslav capital in
preparation for possible air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pledged radar-avoiding B-2 bombers and
F-117A attack jets to a NATO force of up to 430 warplanes that
would hit Serbian military targets, officials said. The B-2 bomber,
which is capable of dropping 40,000 pounds of satellite-guided
``smart'' bombs, has never been used before in combat.

JAPANESE LEADER APOLOGIZES FOR OCCUPATION OF KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Seeking to forge a new relationship with the Korean
people, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered an unusually forthright
apology Thursday for Japanese colonial occupation of the Korean
peninsula early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   In the complex politics of apology, which play an important role
in Japan's relations with its neighbors, Thursday's statement
marked one more step toward greater public contrition for World War
II, and South Korea seemed pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese statement came in a meeting with the visiting South
Korean president, Kim Dae-jung. Past visits by South Korean leaders
were also occasions for Japanese apologies, but this time the
statement was given extra weight by being included in the joint
declaration issued by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obuchi, looking back on the relations between Korea and Japan
in this century, humbly accepted the historical fact that the
Japanese colonial rule inflicted unbearable damage and pain on
Korean people and expressed remorseful repentance and heartfelt
apology for the ordeal,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The wording was based on a landmark 1995 speech by Tomiichi
Murayama, who was then prime minister, about Japanese conduct
during World War II. But in some ways Thursday's statement went
further because it was part of an official declaration, while
Murayama's speech had been personal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Murayama is a socialist who is outside the Japanese
mainstream, while Obuchi is a central figure in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's statement was directed only at Korea. But if the
Japanese government likes the response, it could be used as the
basis for a more general official apology for Japanese conduct
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from North Korea, with which
Japan's relationship is extremely chilly.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia continues to be haunted by the war, even after 53
years, and Koreans and Chinese in particular are deeply suspicious
that Japan feels insufficient remorse and might again become a
military power if it had the chance. Japan, on the other hand,
feels its neighbors are being unreasonable by demanding one apology
after another from a country where the great majority of citizens
have no memory of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions are particularly great with Korea, which Japan
brutally occupied from 1910 until the end of the war in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Japan may have been willing to make an unusually humble apology
in this case in part because President Kim is seen as a genuine
peacemaker who wants to improve ties, rather than as a hostile
figure who will use Thursday's statement to try to extort more aid.
Indeed, Kim has gone out of the way here to talk about the need to
build a ``future-oriented relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim also said South Korea would move quickly to relax its ban on
Japanese music and movies, underscoring the thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
   Within Japan, the apology seemed to get broad support, but some
officials in the Liberal Democratic Party have complained, saying
Japan helped Korea during the colonial period and has no need to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean newspapers welcomed the Japanese apology, with the
Chosun Ilbo calling it a ``significant event'' and the Jong-ang
Ilbo saying it had ``special meaning'' because it was focused on
Korea rather than a general statement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the resentments in Korea run deep, and many Koreans want
to see not just words but also a broad effort by Japan to pay
official compensation to Koreans who were war-time sex slaves of
the imperial army or who were forced laborers constructing tunnels
and doing other work in Japan for the war effort. So far Japan has
offered informal private payments to the former sex slaves, but has
refused to consider official compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim spoke frankly to the Japanese parliament, saying ``doubts
and mistrust'' about Japan are widespread in Asia because of
Japan's reluctance to face the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan needs true courage to look at the past squarely and
respect the judgment of history,'' he declared. ``South Korea
should also rightly evaluate Japan, in all its changed aspects, and
search with hope for future possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In one indication of the continuing tensions, Kim spoke to the
parliament in Korean, even though he speaks fluent Japanese from
his childhood in the colonial era. In the United States, he spoke
in English to a joint meeting of Congress, but aides said it would
be politically impossible for Kim to deliver an address in the
hated colonial language.

U.S. SAID TO FACE BRUNT OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
wound up their annual meetings on Thursday saying that the United
States will bear most of the burden of helping Asia and the rest of
the developing world get out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   America's relatively strong economy will draw in the exports of
crisis-stricken countries at the same time that foreign demand for
U.S. goods is weakened. As a result, the United States'
balance-of-payments deficit will soar, with IMF forecasts showing
the U.S. deficit rising sharply from $155 billion in 1997 to $236
billion this year and $290 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One implication of that rising deficit is that a steady increase
in competitively priced imports can, over time, lead to an erosion
of U.S. market share and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 15-member countries of the European Union and
Japan will continue running substantial payment surpluses with
exports far in excess of imports.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, struck
a note of quiet desperation when he described his country's failure
to recover economically, saying at the annual meeting that,
``despite steady implementation of the latest economic policy
package, the largest ever, our economic situation is still
extremely severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan seems set to remain in deep recession this year with only
a minute recovery next year. Its already massive payments surplus
of $94 billion last year is expected to reach $131 billion this
year and $135 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In his final address and press conference on Thursday, Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, said the world was making
progress toward resolving the crisis that has gripped much of the
global economy since the collapse of some of Asia's leading
economies last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could have happened more than has happened,'' he said.
``We are dealing with a monumental task.''
</P>
<P>
   The 182 countries represented at the meetings endorsed his
proposals for tackling five ``major shortcomings'' in the
international financial system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   These included a lack of transparency about economic details
throughout the world that impeded sound policy making; weak
financial systems; unrestricted and volatile flows of capital
around the globe; a reluctance to make private banks and other
financial institutions pay part of the costs of the crisis; and
better regulation of world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is now ``confident'' agreement will be reached
between the Clinton administration and Congress to give the IMF
about $18 billion in new financing as part of a $90 billion effort
by several countries to recapitalize the fund.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The meeting endorsed Clinton's call for a new standby loan fund
linked to the IMF that would bolster the financial defenses of some
countries before they came under attack from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus said agreement is also close on new steps to shore up
Brazil's shaky economy that would include an announcement by
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later this month of new
austerity measures in return for a new a package of loans from the
IMF and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while the world economy was still sailing ``stormy,
uncharted waters,'' Camdessus said the recent cut in interest rates
by the Federal Reserve, and Europe's low interest rates, showed
that central bankers are striving to preserve economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth must be sustained. Inflation is not a danger,''
Camdessus said. Early on Thursday, the Bank of England cut a key
interest rate by a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, while this year's annual meeting undoubtedly
produced a plethora of ideas on mending the world's damaged
monetary system and a positive avalanche of pledges to do so, it
has not yet resulted in any concrete action.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of both the IMF and the World Bank put the best
possible face on the outcome despite the lack of specific action
and the vagueness of many of the pledges made by member countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have undoubtedly moved a long way forward in identifying
the steps needed to establish a more durable global economic system
and for addressing the crisis,'' Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of people being pushed back into abject poverty
throughout the developing world by the economic downturn, the World
Bank president, James Wolfensohn, expressed satisfaction that
governments now recognized that more must be done to protect people
from the social costs of the crisis.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton maintained an ordinary schedule
and an air of absorption Thursday in routine public business as the
House approved an impeachment investigation that might shorten his
term in office and would certainly affect his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced measures to protect Medicare recipients
dropped from their health plans, warned of a looming refugee
catastrophe in Kosovo, lunched with Vice President Al Gore, signed
a bill to publish records of Nazi war criminals and met with his
economic advisers on the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
   In his only remarks on the impeachment vote, Clinton told
reporters in a brief picture-taking session late Thursday afternoon
that his future was ``not in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it is in the hands of the Congress,'' Clinton said
Thursday. ``I don't think it's appropriate to comment further
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, as the House was engaged in its wrenching
debate over the impeachment inquiry, Clinton was before a friendly
audience in the Roosevelt Room of the White House discussing
Medicare and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   As he completed his remarks, reporters tried to shout questions
about the impeachment debate and the hearings that were likely to
begin shortly after the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Their entreaties were drowned out by applause from a carefully
selected audience of Democratic lawmakers, administration officials
and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the official transcript of the event reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, will you voluntarily testify?''
</P>
<P>
   He offered no response as he left the room.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton had not watched
any of the House debate on the impeachment inquiry, unless he
caught glimpses of it on one of the dozens of television sets in
the West Wing tuned to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe he's watched any of it, unless he's watched it
in passing, walking through a hallway,'' Lockhart said. ``He is
surely interested in the outcome, but he's got a job to do here,
and that's what he's focused on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart added: ``We don't have the luxury of being distracted
or being anyplace else. We have the people's business to do here,
and in fact, that's what's happening over the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said the only suspense about
Thursday's impeachment vote was the number of Democrats who would
vote for the Republican impeachment resolution, and even that
number was pretty well known on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri told the White
House on the eve of the vote that he expected about 30 Democrats,
some in tight re-election races, to defect and join the
Republicans. Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The president's apparent nonchalance was the result of this
early intelligence, the White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing got built up bigger than it needed or should have
been,'' the official said. ``We're talking about a process that we
kind of knew the outcome of for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said throughout his regular briefing this afternoon
that the president remained focused on important matters of state _
the federal budget, the crisis in Kosovo, the future of Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was asked whether there would ever come a time when the
president would shift his focus from these matters to his personal
survival. ``I don't know how to answer that,'' Lockhart replied.

in harmony with a growing number of middle-class Americans and are

   ALBANIA-REFUGE _ TIRANA, Albania _ In the midst of all the
turmoil of trying to care for and house tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanian refugees flooding into this country from Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province, one man's efforts to help stands out. An ethnic
Albanian who left Kosovo for a better life with his family in
Switzerland many years ago, the man returned to Albania to build
apartments. Before he could finish putting windows and doors on his
first building, the refugee crisis erupted. Seeing that the people
needed shelter, he borrowed $8,000 to finish the building and is
now housing -- for free _ 108 people in 24 apartments. Although
they are sleeping on floors with no lights and running water, to
them he is a godsend. (Roughton, Cox News Service, 450 words).

   CHINA-TAIWAN _ BEIJING _ China and Taiwan have stepped gingerly
in recent weeks to avoid stamping on each other's sensitive
political toes. They are getting ready for the highest level public
contact since 1993, a resumption of ``cross-straits talks'' (Oct.
14-19) that seek a way for peaceful co-existence between the giant
communist China and the small democratic island that broke away in
1949, envisioning itself a nation. Despite the gentle words heard
lately _ Taiwan cancelled military exercises, China promised
unprecedented concessions if the two unite again _ deep differences
remain. And the stakes are huge. China's latest defense doctrine
still maintains it has the right to use force to bring Taiwan back
to the fold, should negotiations fail. And America has promised to
defend the island where a popular movement for formal independence
is growing. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).

simple to complicated. Stories will move on the Cox Wire and photos

   cornfields, horse-drawn buggies and the plain white houses of

   CLINTON-ASIA _ WASHINGTON _ Throughout his ordeal in the Monica

Presidency has been the strength of the U.S. economy -- a virtual
juggernaut for the last five years. But that armor is showing some
chinks: lower exports; higher unemployment; slower job growth.
Small wonder then that the president is screaming louder than ever
for Congress to fund the IMF; and that he is ignoring a nuclear
headache in the Indian subcontinent to ward off the Asian flu in
the Pacific Rim. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   TOBACCO _ PEACHTREE, N.C. _ The Barnett family of Peachtree,
N.C., harvests burley tobacco as they have for generations, on one
of the small tobacco farms that were once common throughout much of
the South. Randy Barnett, 45, principal at the local elementary
school, has been doing this long enough to see public opinion of
his crop wither. ``Fifteen years ago, people were real proud of
their tobacco,'' he says. ``And now,'' he shakes his head. ``People
think you are like a drug dealer. The kids at school think its a
bad thing.'' (Harmon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45. WITH

   SEATTLE _ Anyone trying to define the cuisine of the Pacific
Northwest needs to look beyond the oysters and salmon, the
Starbucks and the micro-suds. On an epicurean visit to the city, we
discover a vibrant explosion of Pan-Asian cooking styles and
organic markets (often served by Asian and Hispanic farmers). At
the perennially hot Pike Place Market, we forage for peavines and
purslane, raspberries and wild mushrooms _ and fall in love with
some of the saltier nooks and crannies like Emmett Watson's Oyster
Bar and the Athenian Inn. We take a Saturday morning stroll through
the University Hill Organic Market (10 kinds of potatoes at a
single stall!) and turn a compost pile at one of the exuberantly
decorated P-Patch gardens, where land-locked locals are growing
their own herbs (visitors are welcome to take walking tours). And
of course, no trip to Seattle would be complete without seeing the
jumpin' salmon at Ballard Locks. Quotes from local foodies like
seafood and organic-farming expert Jon Rowley, Mexican cookbook

   CLONING _ As an Illinois teen, Steve Stice would huddle by sheep
as they struggled to give birth. More than two decades later, Stice
is still captivated by the miracle of it all. In January, he
awaited the birth of two Holstein calves that were particularly
special to Stice: Not only did he clone them, but they were the
first in the world to carry a genetic marker he had spliced into
their DNA. Now, Stice is leaving his New England farm for the
University of Georgia. His arrival could make Georgia a leader in
cloning animals for more efficient food production and ``pharming''
- using genetically altered animals to produce medicine through
their milk. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50 WITH GRAPHIC

EMISSIONS CUT WILL RAISE FUEL COSTS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department's official forecasting arm
has produced an extraordinarily pessimistic forecast of steeply
rising energy prices if the United States fights global warming by
clamping down on emissions of heat-trapping gases that come from
burning fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Under various outcomes, the forecasting arm, the Energy
Information Administration, projected gasoline prices would rise to
between $1.39 and $1.91 a gallon, and electricity prices would rise
20 percent to 86 percent by 2010. Natural gas prices would rise
significantly and coal prices would soar, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
   Under an international agreement negotiated last year in Kyoto,
Japan, the United States would have to reduce emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases significantly in 10 to 15 years.
But the treaty is in trouble in Congress, where opponents often say
it would wreck the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's forecast is sharply at odds with the
Clinton administration's previous assertions that the United States
can meet the targets set by the treaty without significant economic
disruption. The forecast is to be presented Friday at a
congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The new study plays directly into the hands of treaty opponents,
but those who favor the treaty said the study is deeply flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Energy conservation advocates said the forecast, produced using
the Energy Information Administration's standard economic models,
had relied on absurd assumptions and improper analysis to reach
ridiculous conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most flawed, biased, intellectually
dishonest analyses ever produced by an supposedly unbiased
analytical organization,'' said Joseph Romm, a former assistant
secretary of energy. Romm is an expert on energy technologies like
solar power and conservation that would help control greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   He and other critics said the study discounted many of the
policies, like tax incentives and research subsidies, that the
administration had proposed for enforcing the treaty if the Senate
approved it. They said it used computer models that were unreliable
for long-term forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   They said it did not account for the lower costs that would
result from a key feature of the administration's climate change
policy: international emissions trading, which would allow the
United States to meet the treaty's targets largely by paying other
countries to reduce their output of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also said the forecast assumed that businesses would be
slow to adopt new energy technologies although, under the
forecast's own projections, the costs of not acting would be high.
</P>
<P>
   Many such computer models have been used for projecting the
costs of the Kyoto agreement protocol on climate change. Because so
much depends on the assumptions of the models, their predictions
may not be reliable. And critics noted that the Energy Department
had a long track record of making bad predictions about long-range
trends in energy prices and pollution control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the new study is certain to fuel criticism of the
treaty. The study is scheduled to be presented Friday at a hearing
of the House Science Committee, whose chairman, Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., is a leading critic of the climate change
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The study's projections of the costs of controlling the
emissions of greenhouse gases are significantly greater than the
predictions of several similar studies, even the gloomy forecasts
paid for by industry opponents of the treaty that predicted
extraordinary costs.
</P>
<P>
   And it predicts that the costs would be much higher than
predicted by Dr. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, in a study released in July.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Claussen, a former senior State Department official who
helped negotiate the Kyoto agreement, said that just as Dr.
Yellen's analysis was wildly optimistic, this one was wildly
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these forecasts are totally unrealistic,'' Ms.
Claussen said. ``It is the most bizarre thing. They haven't put out
a single bit of analytical work on the costs that has any
credibility at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Claussen now directs the Pew Center on Climate Change, which
has drawn together major corporations pledging early actions to cut
their emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Romm, who now consults with businesses on how to cut greenhouse
gas emissions, criticized the report's assertions that emerging
technologies like solar power and fuel cells would gain little over
20 years although costs of traditional fuels were likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed the study's finding that even with coal prices
soaring, power plants would not install any measurable cogeneration
equipment, which uses waste heat to generate extra electricity from
coal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new study predicts slowing economic growth as a
result of higher energy costs, over the long run this amounts to
just tens of billions of dollars in an economy that grows to more
than $10 trillion.

   BC-CLINTON-STARR-RDP-NYT (moved on Saturday, October 3)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, Oct. 3,
about the origins of Kenneth W. Starr's investigation into
President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky misstated
Mr. Starr's role in Paula Jones's lawsuit against the President.
Although Mr. Starr offered to help the Independent Women's Forum in
filing a friend-of-the-court brief in the lawsuit before becoming
independent counsel in 1994, he did not write such a brief and none
was filed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only in America could the House debate authorizing
an impeachment investigation of President Clinton juxtapose
quotations of the Founding Fathers with those of the wayward
daughter, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever asked me to lie!'' Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony rang out in the debating chamber, read loudly by a
Clinton supporter in a warning of woeful things to come as
Republicans pushed through their resolution for an open-ended
impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hush of exasperation in some corners of the House at
the very mention of the name of Ms. Lewinsky, the former White
House intern who, even before the vote, Republicans were vowing to
call to Capitol Hill to re-tell her tale of an intimate affair with
the president and their failed cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky?'' asked
Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, drawing instant
groans from his partisans as he excoriated ``this daily mudslide
into the nation's living rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two more years of Linda Tripp?'' he asked and, even in the
citizens' gallery, up above the agonizing Democrats and the
triumphant Republicans, a few head-shaking ``no's'' could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people don't want this,'' Joy Fugazi, a tourist
from Lexington, Ky., fervidly insisted minutes later outside the
gallery, still mesmerized by the wide-eyed spectacle of
self-government she and the nation had just witnessed _ the House
of Representatives targeting the president himself for
investigation and possible removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben Franklin described it as an alternative to
assassination,'' Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said ominously even as
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., exulted: ``The world marvels that
our president is not above the law!''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stressed that it was Clinton himself who put the
Democrats in their predicament of having to denounce his behavior
even as they argued that it does not merit impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the trustee of the nation's conscience,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who led the debate as chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyerly citations abounded amid the partisan cut-and-thrust.
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who dedicated more than a year to the
President's impeachment, sounded gleeful in citing ``no less a
constitutional scholar than William Jefferson Clinton'' as having
argued as a law professor in the Watergate era that any ``willful
reckless behavior in office'' was impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rugged, at times scathing, debate, with Democrats
emboldened to upbraid Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was up in the
chair presiding. Last year he was reprimanded and treated far more
gently by House Republicans for his own ethical transgressions,
Democrats complained, in comparison to the trauma Clinton faces in
the looming struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reject this double Republican standard which exalts the
speaker and moves to impeach the president,'' said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi of California, drawing cheers from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has not sinned?'' came the cry at one point as the
Democrats argued that the issue was more about sex than perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular order!'' responded the Republicans, demanding a tight
gavel and driving the impeachment motion to a vote. The tally
included 31 Democrats wary of facing the voters next month without
some cover after the Democratic alternative for a limited
impeachment inquiry had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware the wrath of the American public!'' growled Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., glaring at the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Off the floor, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on the Judiciary
Committee, easily conceded, ``Yeah, we've all got a tiger by the
tail.'' But he added that only a full factual investigation, not
some mere rubber stamping of the allegations of the Office of the
Independent Counsel, can certify the inquiry as fair in the eyes of
future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate at least established that there is no longer much
argument left in the Republicans about whether President Richard
Nixon was, after all, guilty. One Republican warned that failing to
confront Clinton for lying under oath ``will be a return to the
imperial presidency of the Nixon era, where the White House felt
that the laws did not apply to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the debate, the mood was almost casual on the
Republican sidelines, with predictions offered that charges of
impeachment will surely be voted next year. ``I think it's headed
to the Senate,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who wandered over
to the House in a mood of quiet expectation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, even as they voted for a limited inquiry, could
only warn about the public's intolerance of further doses of Ms.
Lewinsky, uttering her name as if it were a imprecation and
envisioning torpid weeks of the civic agenda filled with her
``stupid telephone chatter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The global economy is crumbling and we're talking about Monica
Lewinsky!'' keened Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting belittlement, Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, tailored
the great Watergate question to Clinton's Lewinsky affair. But
Traficant touched off one of the few bipartisan touches of the
debate, general laughter, as his surreal query hung in the air:
``What did the president do with an intern, and when did he know
that he did it?''

<P>
   BOURNEMOUTH, England _ Seeking to end damaging party quarrels
and bolster his own unproven leadership, William Hague told
Conservatives Thursday that they had to be tough with the Labor
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to take off the gloves and punch our weight,'' Hague
said in a speech notable more for its philosophy than specific
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He laid out a ``British way'' to combat Blair's vaunted ``third
way.'' And on the issue that has divided the party and the
conference, he said, ``The British way is to be in Europe but not
run by Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives, he said, had to become known as ``the party
of personal liberty'' to provide favorable contrast to the
``bossy'' Labor Party, which, he argued, is turning Britain into
``a nanny state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his party had learned the need to ``listen to
Britain'' from its trouncing in the last election and that party
workers now reported a falloff in the ``the old hostility that
greeted us on the doorstep.'' He acknowledged that the party had
yet to turn that into enthusiasm, saying that was the mission
before them.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before the conference, Hague tried to put an end to
squabbling over Europe by holding a ballot of party members and
announcing the verdict on the eve of the gathering. The referendum
asked whether they supported Hague's position of keeping Britain
out of the European single currency for at least the next eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained the electoral results he wanted _ 84 percent of the
voters endorsed his policy _ but not the results he sought for
party peace. Although Hague said the outcome proved that his view
was now ``the settled will'' of the party, opponents argued that
the turnout was only 58 percent and that, therefore, the support
for the policy among all party members amounted to less than half,
or 49.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More critically for the party prospects for unity, some major
Conservative figures with broad popularity and tested experience in
the party assailed the policy and said they would continue to.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them were Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime
minister under John Major and Kenneth Clarke, former chancellor of
the Exchequer.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is an issue that dogged the Tories through the last of
their 18 years in government and produced the disarray that
contributed to the size of their defeat in the election of May 1,
1997. That was the worst loss for the Conservatives since 1832,
costing the party all its seats in Scotland and Wales and
delivering a 179-member parliamentary majority to Labor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blair kept Britain out of the first wave of 11 nations that are
entering the monetary union but has broadly hinted that if
conditions are favorable the country will sign up at the second
entry point, expected in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A strong undercurrent ran through the four-day conference over
whether Hague, clever and congenial but so far unconvincing, was
proving to be a leader of the stature to pull the depleted and
dispirited Conservatives back into power.
</P>
<P>
   As the conference opened on Tuesday, a Gallup poll in The Daily
Telegraph showed the Conservatives with the support of 23 percent
of the electorate, down from its already dismal 31 percent in the
election, and Labor at 57 percent, 13 points higher than its total
then.
</P>
<P>
   Hague, 37, is the youngest party leader since 24-year-old
William Pitt led the Tories in 1783. But he is a more experienced
observer of British politics than his age and his stint of only
three years in Major's Cabinet would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to stress unity the conference brought to the stage
two former prime ministers, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who
have carried on a personal vendetta in the 22 years since the
latter replaced the former as party leader.
</P>
<P>
   They have not exchanged a word in all that time, and they
remained separated and silent in back-to-back armchairs throughout
their appearance. The display underlined the division in the party,
as Mrs. Thatcher, an opponent of further integration with Europe,
gleefully applauded speakers who pledged to protect the pound, and
Heath, an advocate of closer ties to Europe, kept his hands folded
in his lap.

REPUBLICAN LEADS RACE FOR GLENN'S SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he
won re-election as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote,
stunning even his most optimistic supporters and setting a
20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is barred from seeking a
third term, is running again, this time for the Senate seat held by
John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who
expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four years
ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge that he is
well positioned to increase the Republican majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary
Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former
commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is
crisscrossing the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she
describes as a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a
comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted to her side
nationally known Democrats _ President Clinton foremost among them
_ on the campaign trail. Glenn, the former astronaut who is
preparing to return to space this month at the age of 77, has not
made an endorsement in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning
hard on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61,
as a lackluster steward who allowed the state's schools to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised to be the education governor,'' said Ms. Boyle.
``But after seven and a half years he has failed the students of
this state.'' Her role in the campaign, she said, ``is to remind
the people of the state of Ohio that George Voinovich made a
promise and that he didn't deliver on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she discusses a decision last year by the Ohio
Supreme Court that cited wide disparities in the quality of the
state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for funding
them.
</P>
<P>
   She has also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting a
proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that
plan, half the additional funds would have been used for school
improvement with the remainder earmarked for reducing property
taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved to be
wildly unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voters opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   While the topics of taxes and education are hot ones this
political season in Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis
on them has helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing in the
opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich by 10 percentage
points in some polls and as much as 18 points in others.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is
running her first statewide race and has widespread union support,
has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7
million Voinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former
lieutenant governor, has been on statewide ballots five times over
the last 20 years and thus is the better-known candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral dynamics of Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The
northern half of the state, with its history of industrial,
unionized cities, has a tradition of voting largely for Democratic
candidates, while the southern tier of the state is considered more
conservative and typically leans Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain,
depriving Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often
accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once
delivered newspapers to the Boyle home in the working-class
Collinwood section of Cleveland. And Voinovich, a former mayor of
Cleveland, has developed a reputation as a moderate Republican who
works well with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a
full schedule of official duties, assuming the role of the
experienced, elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about
domestic policy than any member of the Senate,'' he said in an
interview on Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a
ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum
cleaner museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mayor, I had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban
America and was fairly successful in dealing with them. And, as
governor, I have dealt with the problems of Medicaid, welfare and
education. I'm the only person in the United States who has been
president of the National League of Cities and chairman of the
National Governors Association.''
</P>
<P>
   To his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich
is dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has
been endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National
Education Association,'' he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a
member of the state Legislature during the period cited in the
Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
and a member of the Democratic leadership during those years,''
Voinovich said. ``They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did
nothing for technology and the urban school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boyle, who has not yet begun to run campaign commercials on
television, said her status as the underdog had ``allowed me to be
more focused, more intense.'' Pausing after a campaign fund-raising
breakfast with former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: ``This has been a marathon and
it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're down to the last three
miles. It's a tough race.''

DOLLAR HITS 111.73 YEN BEFORE STAGING COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Foreign-exchange traders battered the dollar into
what looked like a second consecutive free fall Thursday before the
currency abruptly reversed course, ending only slightly lower
against the Japanese yen in extraordinarily volatile dealings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the dollar registered its biggest one-day drop
against the yen in a quarter century, losing more than 8 percent of
its value.
</P>
<P>
   There was little movement between the currencies during
overnight trading in Tokyo, but when European markets opened the
dollar again came under attack, plunging as much as 7 percent, to a
low of 111.73 yen, a level last seen in early June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Selling slowed and then turned during the afternoon in New York,
and by late in the day the dollar was quoted at 119.05 yen, down
from 120.25 yen late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been about the craziest day my colleagues and I have
ever seen,'' said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist
at BankBoston. ``But in spite of this we are optimistic, because we
seem to have gotten rid of the speculative excess that was in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   As on Wednesday, traders said much of the selling was done by
large speculative hedge funds unwinding positions they had taken
based on a bet that the yen would remain weak. And the impact of
those sales was magnified because trading volume was quite light
Thursday, Fand and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been very quiet,'' said Michael Rosenberg,
manager of currency and international fixed-income research at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``There is no liquidity in this market, and no
appetite for risk in this sort of a chaotic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the dollar's slide slowed and then reversed after
the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began
calling currency dealers to ask about conditions in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fed, which has operational control of the
government's day-to-day dealings in the foreign exchange market,
makes such calls when conditions appear unsettled. But some traders
interpreted the inquiries as a possible sign that the Fed might be
preparing to buy dollars to send a message that the United States
wants the dollar to stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fand said traders were encouraged by news bulletins
suggesting that a rescue package for Brazil was in the process of
being assembled, and that Congress, after much delay, may be close
to approving an $18 billion increase in funds for the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, there was a recognition that the dollar
had fallen much too steeply and much too fast against the yen,
especially considering recent predictions that the dollar could
reach 160 yen by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' Fand said. ``What had happened was an
obscene level of a correction for a two-day period. There are
clearly buyers of dollars with the dollar between 110 yen and 115
yen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rosenberg seemed to share the view that the dollar's wild
gyrations against the yen were effectively over. Over the coming
weeks and months, he said he expected the dollar to move higher
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to build a base where the dollar trades between 115
yen and 125 yen,'' he said. ``I think that will be the range for
the next few weeks. After that, we think the dollar will gradually
appreciate against the yen,'' perhaps to as high as 170.
</P>
<P>
   News that a financial rescue package for Brazil was being
assembled also helped push the dollar up against the German mark
and other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the dollar was trading at 1.6375 German marks, up
from 1.6138 marks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any doubt, this last week was a turning point for
financial markets,'' Fand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message has been conveyed that a line has been drawn in
the sand, and that emerging markets will not be allowed to bleed
any more. If Brazil is going to be saved and the IMF is going to
get its funding, the world has to have some renewed confidence that
this is the end of the financial crisis.''

 MIT Media Lab Cooking Up New Inventions   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Cambridge, Mass.  
 
A kitchen counter that knows how to cook. A stuffed toy chicken
that kids can use as a computer interface. PCs that sense when
you're having a rough day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory opened their doors yesterday for a rare glimpse at their
vision of the future, showing off inventions that could change how
we work, play, create and even how we communicate with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers now don't have much to do with life,'' said Michael
Hawley, an assistant professor of media technology at MIT, who is
heading the 3-day-old Counter Intelligence project to bring
computing power into the kitchen. ``What if a food processor had a
real processor in it? What if PostScript were for pasta?''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the kitchen lab, researcher Niko Matsakis is getting a
recipe for chocolate chip cookies from a digital countertop. When
he pours the chips into a pan, the counter tells him when he's
poured the right amount and instructs him to mix the milk with the
chocolate. Eventually, the device will take him through the recipe,
making sure he uses the right ingredients in the right amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the lab is an eggplant engraved with a picture of
Martha Stewart _ the product of a laser cutting machine that uses
PostScript software to write and draw. Hawley's students also have
used the laser cutter _ a machine the size of a photocopier that
carves plastic and other hard materials _ to print words on
crackers. Hawley imagines that children might learn to read from
crackers, cookies or maybe even pasta.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Lab, founded in 1980, is known for its work on such
key technologies as multimedia and digital video as well as for the
freewheeling atmosphere that has sparked playful creations like
robotic Lego toys that kids can program and wearable computers
embedded in eyeglasses, jewelry and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's open house was part of a meeting of the News in the
Future consortium and its corporate sponsors, which include
Chronicle Publishing Co., which publishes The Chronicle. This
group's research has spawned, among other things, paper with
electronic ink that can change with each day's news and name tags
that help groups interact.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blumberg is using a plush chicken toy to make it easy for
children to interact with computers. Manipulating the chicken moves
an animated character on a computer screen. &UR;  &LR; If they want the
on-screen chicken to fly, they flap the toy chicken's wings. If
they want the animated chicken to stand on its head, they turn the
toy upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell a kid to make the chicken (on the screen) run,
they'll just do it. There's no pressing a function key or space
bar. There's no joystick,'' said Blumberg, an assistant professor
of media arts and sciences. ``You want the interface to match the
thing it's controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a kid-friendly interface, the chicken and other
animal toys could let kids control a character in a cartoon or
learn about wildlife, Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Picard, associate professor of media arts and sciences,
is working on toys, too _ toys that can sense human emotions. By
measuring how hard or often a ball is bounced, she and her students
hope to be able to ``tell if it's being bounced happily or being
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Picard is doing similar work with personal computers. A computer
using a camera to see your facial expressions, a microphone to hear
what you say or how you say it, and a sensor to tell how hard
you're hitting the keyboard may be able to respond. If it knows
you're cursing and pounding a key because you can't print, for
instance, it could tell you that co-workers have also gotten angry
when they tried to print or it can give you information on other
ways to print the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're willing to give the computer continuous feedback, it
can improve itself, pass information to another person or maybe
even show empathy in the appropriate situation,'' said Picard, who
also hopes to figure out how to make e-mail express emotions
without using smiley faces.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lab's work is likely to make computers even more a
part of everyday life. But it is just as devoted to making
computers more useful _ or more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the Responsive Environments Group built a sneaker
that has 17 sensors and a minuscule computer and measures how the
foot moves and makes musical sounds depending on what occurs.
Eventually Joseph Paradiso, principal research scientist in the
group, hopes to figure out how to make it possible for dancers to
make music.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gershenfeld, who runs the Physics and Media group, is
building such useful devices as a medicine shelf that knows if
you've got the right prescription and can signal your doctor when
you've taken it. Each pill bottle contains a computing device that
costs just a penny, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gershenfeld and his students also have built a device that lets
you transmit data such as your business card through a handshake.
Their work on a magic trick for performers Penn and Teller led NEC,
which builds controllers for air bags, to build a device that can
tell if a child's car seat is facing the front or the back of the
car. The device is designed to keep air bags from harming children.

 New PCs To Sell For $500   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
While other personal computer makers are scrambling to turn a
profit on sub-$1,000 systems, newly formed Emachines is about to
introduce a fully equipped PC _ including monitor _ for less than
$500.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's several hundred dollars less than entry-level systems
from Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Packard Bell.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing a beachhead at $500, Emachines hopes to lure
first-time buyers who until now couldn't afford a PC. It's also
targeting consumers who are considering second and third PCs for
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred dollars is the magic number for opening up the
next wave of adopters in the home,'' said Steve Dukker, chief
executive of Emachines, a joint venture of two Korean companies
that is based in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The $499 eTower 266 features a 266 MHz Cyrix processor, a 2.1
gigabyte hard drive, 32 megabytes of memory, &UR;  &LR; a 56K modem, a CD-ROM
drive and a 14-inch monitor. The computer is available without the
monitor for $399.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first people in the market to produce a low-priced
PC that isn't made up of last quarter's leftover components, or
last year's mistakes,'' said Dukker.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dukker, Emachines already has orders for all
200,000 PCs it plans to produce by the end of the year. The systems
will go on sale at Best Buy and Office Depot stores by
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are taking Emachines seriously for a couple of reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ The company has formidable backing. It's owned by two
well-established South Korean companies _ TriGem, a maker of PCs
and motherboards, and Korean Data Systems, a leading maker of PC
monitors. Both companies manufacture products for big U.S. computer
makers.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's being run by Dukker, a computer retailing veteran and an
expert on the consumer market. Prior to joining Emachines, he was
senior vice president of merchandising for Computer City, and
before that he held a similar post at CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   After CompUSA announced its acquisition of Computer City in
June, KDS executives invited Dukker to meet with them in Seoul,
figuring he might be in the market for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   He met with officials of KDS and TriGem _ both companies he had
worked with in the past. Emachines was born shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for my guidance as to how they could take
their expertise in high-volume, low-overhead production and make
the best use of it in the U.S.,'' Dukker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling,'' he told them, ``is that we're really ready to
enter the time of mass-produced, low-priced PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukker hopes that by selling large numbers of computers,
Emachines can keep inventory to a minimum and make a profit despite
the new system's low price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Emachines is planning to introduce several other computers,
including a 300 MHz eTower for $599 (including monitor), an
ultra-light notebook for under $2,000 and an entertainment device
for playing games and watching DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the company also will start selling a PC with a
built-in monitor and a sleek design like the Apple iMac, for under
$700.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give Emachines a good chance at early success. But
there is little doubt that other companies, including Packard Bell
and CTX, will drop their entry level prices below $500 next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emachines has a six-month to one-year lead on branded
rivals,'' said Van Baker of Dataquest. ``Their ability to sustain
beyond that depends on how committed TriGem and KDS are.''
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear is how much in the way of technical support
Emachines will be able to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is not just selling the box but also providing service
levels that people require, especially first-time buyers,'' said
Schelley Olhava of International Data Corp.

PRICE INCREASE OPTIONAL UNDER PROPOSED TOBACCO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Minn., Miss., Texas) (jw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under a national settlement being negotiated by the tobacco
industry, cigarette makers would not be required to pass along to
consumers the cost of the deal, a price increase that many
anti-smoking advocates have said is critical to reducing under-age
tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   As part of federal legislation that failed earlier this year,
cigarette producers would have been required to pass along the cost
_ about $1.10 a pack _ to consumers. Though there is disagreement
over the precise impact of price increases on teen-age cigarette
use, many public health experts have held that such increases
represent a major weapon in reducing smoking by young people.
</P>
<P>
   But the $198 billion national settlement deal being negotiated
by lawyers for the industry and eight states would allow cigarette
makers to absorb part or all of its costs, several lawyers briefed
on the proposal said.
</P>
<P>
   That means that producers may choose for competitive reasons to
hold down cigarette prices or decide the pace of how they will pass
along the settlement's cost. The plan would cost producers 35 to 40
cents a pack over the next five years, industry officials and an
analyst estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will increase cigarette prices slowly to get
consumers used to the higher price increases,'' said Bonnie Zoller,
a tobacco industry analyst with the Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp. ``A sharp increase in prices could cause a drop in
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of smoking and some economists have argued that a
sharp, significant increase in cigarette prices could provide the
most effective way to reduce teen-age smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In May, for example, Lawrence Summers, deputy treasury
secretary, testified before Congress that the Clinton
administration believed that the ``best way to combat youth smoking
is to raise the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers testified that studies showed that every 10 percent
increase in cigarette prices could produce up to a 7 percent
decrease in the number of children who smoked. But other economists
have called those projections overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the settlement proposal, which has not been
completed, is fundamentally different from the failed federal
tobacco legislation because it leaves the timing of any cigarette
price increases up to the producers.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators briefed on the current talks said they did not have
the legal authority to require cigarette makers to pass along a
settlement's cost because the negotiators were resolving lawsuits,
not passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, tobacco companies have reached settlements with
four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _ that have
brought lawsuits against the industry to recover smoking-related
health costs, agreeing to pay those states some $40 billion over
the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   To reflect the cost of those settlements, producers have
announced increases in the wholesale price of cigarettes amounting
to 25 cents a pack. But the national average retail price of a pack
has remained at about $2.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zoller, the analyst, said that the prices being paid by
smokers had not increased because cigarette makers were deeply
discounting prices on the wholesale level and absorbing settlement
costs as they battled for market share.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she expected the pattern of discounting to
continue for a time if a new national settlement is reached. She
said she believed that the Philip Morris Cos., the nation's largest
cigarette maker, could absorb settlement costs longer than other
producers because it was financially the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zoller said she believed that if the settlement's cost was
passed along to consumers, cigarette use among smokers of all ages
would fall 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, declined
to comment on the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the talks said that a final plan was not
likely to emerge for at least 10 days and might be delayed further.
The new proposal is intended to cover the 46 states that either had
lawsuits pending against the industry or had not sued it.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Philip Morris, the tobacco companies involved are the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.;
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries;
Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corp., and the
smokeless tobacco producer U.S. Tobacco, a subsidiary of UST Inc.

 It's Time for Lofty Earnings Projections to Come Back to Earth   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It's the earnings, stupid.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all due respect to Clinton campaign gurus Paul Begala and
James Carville _ the men responsible for keeping then-Governor
Clinton fixed on the economy during his first triumphant run for
the presidency _ this stock market's latest swoon is about
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Or it has been the reluctance of financial analysts to slash
their profit estimates to a point where they actually reflect the
chaotic economic world in which the rest of us live.
</P>
<P>
   I know. It sounds like you've heard some of this song and dance
before. Earnings, Asia, Russia and Monica have been the top four
reasons why the market has soared or sunk since August's initial
thermonuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Asia caught its nasty strain of financial flu in
July 1997, Wall Street has been remiss in not telling investors
that their favorite companies are not going to make as much money
as people would like to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting slammed again because there's a growing
perception that earnings estimates are still too high,'' says Chuck
Hill, research director for First Call in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-reporting season has only just begun, and it's not likely
to get a whole lot more fun before its over. Public companies are
required to report their quarterly earnings within 45 days of the
end of their fiscal quarter, which is September 30 for most
companies whose fiscal years run concurrently with the calendar
year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings estimates for the third quarter are showing their
steepest revisions (meaning analysts have lowered their
projections) for any quarter since the 1990-91 recession, Hill
says. At the beginning of the third quarter, the average earnings
growth rate for Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies was expected to be
10 percent. Now, analysts estimate profits will shrink by 1.4
percent. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's chief complaint is that financial analysts at brokerages
(the ones who advise clients to buy, sell or hold) have been slow
to slash their earnings projections to levels that truly reflect
the economic pain inflicted throughout much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts ``tend to bring their numbers down only a
quarter at a time,'' says Hill, whose firm specializes in tracking
profit projections and earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   They needed to be less optimistic. Hindsight is 20/20, but Hill
says it was fair to assume that many big-caps (usually considered
to be stocks with market capitalizations over $5 billion) were not
going to continue to grow profits 20 to 30 percent each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The economic woes of Asia are deep. And no matter what your
isolationist neighbor across the fence thinks, anemic economies
throughout that continent are spanking some of investors' favorite
big-cap stocks, such as Coke and Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, now, is for analysts to rachet down their
earnings projections not for one quarter but for the next three to
four quarters so the market doesn't continue to disappoint
investors again next January and April.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, analysts are still looking through rose-colored
glasses. They estimate that fourth-quarter earnings will rise 10
percent. And they project that they will increase 15 percent in the
first quarter of next year and 19 percent for the second quarter of
1999. And while it's true that projections tend to get fluffier the
farther out you look, these estimates are out of the ballpark, Hill
says.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. Dan Coker, an emerging growth strategist with
Schroder &AMP; Co. in New York, agrees. ``It's pretty sad that it took
investors more than a year to realize that (the domestic impact of
the Asian economy) would hit,'' Coker says. ``(But) big-cap
investors have been in la-la land.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Coker has a bias toward small-caps (stocks with market
capitalizations under $1 billion), and he believes that smaller
companies will eventually have their day once big-caps establish a
firm bottom to the market. Of course, heaven knows when that day
may come.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, investors are going to be focused on earnings,
echoes money manager Elaine Hahn, president of Hahn Capital
Management in San Francisco. She also believes that earnings
estimates ``have yet to see a substantial markdown for 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as there is too much fluff in projections _
especially among the widely held big caps _ there will still be
future seasons of earnings disappointments ahead. ``And that's not
a good stage on which to spark a rally,'' Hahn says.

A&AMP;M FOOTBALL STAR IS BUSY MAN ON CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ It's a big week on the Texas A&AMP;M
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow is the showdown for the No. 18 Aggies against No. 2
Nebraska, the highest-ranked team to visit Kyle Field in 15 years,
and a rematch of the 1997 Big 12 championship game.
</P>
<P>
   And, though star middle linebacker Dat Nguyen has been absorbed
as usual in pregame preparation, other things bid for his concern.
Like one of the graduate-school courses he's taking in pursuit of a
master's degree in marketing to complement the bachelor of science
degree he received in August from the college of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're reading a lot about the history of successful
companies and how they got started,'' said Nguyen, who envisions
one day starting his own enterprise. ``It's very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   That one of his closest friends should be so engrossed in such
matters during a week like this is no surprise to safety Rich
Coady, Nguyen's roommate during Aggies road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see the way Dat plays football, the effort he puts into
it,'' Coady said. ``But that's his lifestyle, too. He works hard at
everything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   By no means is football all there is for the most recognizable
A&AMP;M player in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find a more intense guy playing football,'' said
John Thornton, assistant athletic director and adviser to Aggie
Athletes Involved, a community service-oriented organization. ``But
though football is an extremely important part of his life, Dat is
not totally defined by the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the football player. But you also have the student
who graduated early, now the graduate student and a guy who is as
involved in community outreach as much as anyone I can remember in
eight years. And that's not to mention the things he and his family
have had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you,'' Thornton said. ``If the Dat Nguyen story doesn't
bring a tear to your eye, you're not breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nguyen family's flight from war-torn Vietnam when his mother
was pregnant with Dat, the youngest of six children, has become
part of the lore surrounding the youngster who once considered
leaving A&AMP;M because of the disappointment of being redshirted his
freshman year. Instead of packing his bags, however, he became one
of the most honored players in A&AMP;M football history.
</P>
<P>
   His unusual strength and drive come from his family and from
within.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are really a big part of what I do, because of the
things they've been through,'' Nguyen said. ``I can never be in the
dumps long regardless of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back to my parents leaving Vietnam _ not knowing what
to expect, not speaking any English, having five kids _ and it
picks me up and makes me work harder. Everyone in my family \Rtwo
brothers, three sisters\S is having a successful life. That really
drives me.''
</P>
<P>
   He, in turn, has stimulated others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dat has been an inspiration as much as any player I've ever
seen,'' coach R.C. Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   His model permeates every exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize leadership among other things in Dat's degree
plan,'' said Joe Townsend, associate dean for student development
in the college of agriculture. ``He leads by example. Other
students see the effort he puts out and it affects them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Dat to graduate in 4.5 years is exceptional. Only 22
percent of the students at A&AMP;M graduate in four years, and most of
them are not football players. And he is a fabulous person.
Confident, not cocky. Appreciative of the chance to get an
education. What he tells you, you can take to the bank. And just by
being around him, you wouldn't know \Rhis stature as a player\S.
He's not one who looks for fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen cannot, however, avoid acclaim. He doesn't try.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who doesn't hesitate any time anybody asks him for
an autograph or to pose for a picture,'' tight end Dan Campbell
said. ``He's easily the most recognizable player on the team. But
he's happy to be in the position he's in, to maybe help somebody
out in some small way. He's so humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he carries himself makes some of us a little mad
because he does everything so right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen shrugs and laughs _ which he does often _ when asked
about how he has handled recognition, and the attendant loss of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes my day when I can put a smile on a kid's face. I'll
go out of my way to do that any day,'' he said. ``Football is going
to end some day. So I don't try to take advantage of the image of
I'm a football player, I'm Dat Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a regular student. One of 100 guys who play on the
football team. One of 46,000 students who go to school here. I'm
just one of everybody. I think one of the reasons I haven't gotten
caught up in all the publicity is that I have my own friends away
from football. I was lucky to see the big picture early. I didn't
lose touch with people. I've gained friends and been able to focus
on every segment of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nguyen is not one to dismiss what he calls the
roller-coaster ride of his collegiate experience, the places he has
been or the people he has met because of his love of the game of
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every kid in the world would love to trade shoes with
me right now,'' he said. ``I'm one of the lucky ones.''

COACH'S FIRST IMPRESSION LASTING FOR A&AMP;M RECEIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Chris Cole, prospective Texas A&AMP;M
football signee, gathered his family in the living room to listen
to coach R.C. Slocum's recruiting pitch. But the words never
flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got ready to talk,'' Slocum said, ``but something didn't
smell right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole was the first to spot the problem, which had spread across
the sole of Slocum's shoe. While walking to the door, the A&AMP;M coach
had stepped in an unauthorized deposit left on the lawn by a
passing pooch.
</P>
<P>
   Apologies ensued. Moments later, Slocum was on his knees with a
towel, removing the remnants from the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have really impressed them,'' said Slocum, rolling his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he did. As Slocum scrubbed, Cole said he saw a human
side to the A&AMP;M coach he did not notice in fellow recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Man, he doesn't mind getting dirty. ... That's my
coach, right there,''' said Cole, who has stepped up this season to
become the crunch-time target of the Aggies' passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into a game this week against No. 2 Nebraska (5-0, 1-0
Big 12), Cole has accounted for 59 percent of the receiving yards
and 100 percent of the touchdown catches for the 18th-ranked Aggies
(4-1, 1-0).
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coaches say Cole, whose 23 receptions almost triple the
total of the team's No. 2 pass-catcher (Leroy Hodge with eight),
must continue producing at a high level for the team to have enough
offensive balance to upset the Cornhuskers at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow at
Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is on a roll right now,'' Slocum said. ``The more big
plays you make, the more you expect to make them. It's a cyclical
thing. And we'll need all the big plays we can get against
Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole made three huge ones in a 28-9 victory against North Texas,
hauling in touchdown strikes of 60, 35 and 52 yards. He finished
with career highs of six catches and 174 yards. In the team's 24-21
victory against Kansas last week, Cole grabbed a team-high five
passes for 51 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is the guy A&AMP;M has been looking for since Albert
Connell,'' said quarterback Randy McCown, likening Cole to the
Washington Redskins' receiver who left A&AMP;M in 1996 after averaging
more catches per season (49) than any player in school history.
``All you have to do is throw it somewhere close to him and he'll
go up and get it. He makes big-time catches.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been that way. Cole, a junior, grabbed only 13
passes in his first 14 games at A&AMP;M until turning a corner late in
the 1997 season. During the Aggies' final five games, he caught 16
passes for 175 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered an off-season challenge from Steve Kragthorpe,
the Aggies' offensive coordinator who also oversees the team's wide
receivers. Kragthorpe urged Cole to start showing more leadership,
now that he was an upperclassman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hit home with me,'' Cole said. ``Last year, I was just a
kid running around out there. Now, I'm more focused and my
confidence has grown. I want to be the guy we look for on third
down. I want to be the guy who makes things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole (6-foot, 186 pounds) has become all of that, and more, to
the Aggies' passing game. Of the team's 58 completions, 23 have
gone to Cole. Of the 656 passing yards, 387 belong to Cole. His
average of 16.8 yards per catch is more than five yards better than
the team mark (11.3).
</P>
<P>
   Most important, tailback Dante Hall sees a correlation between
Cole's grabbing three touchdown passes on Sept. 26 against North
Texas and the Aggies' ground game producing its first 100-yard
rusher the next week against Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was a huge factor in that,'' said Hall, who romped for
177 yards and three touchdowns against the Jayhawks. ``He can
stretch a defense. People know if they crowd the line to stop the
run, he can make them pay.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they soil his carpet accidentally, Cole holds no grudges.
Just ask R.C. Slocum.

RAIN DELAYS, SCATTERED CROWDS JUST TIP OF GAME 1 ICEBERG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Winning and losing in the playoffs, that's what
baseball should be all about, not some pursuit of a glamorous
record.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire knew that as well as anybody when he said over and
over he envied Sammy Sosa for being in a position to make the
playoffs with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Houston Astros acquired Randy Johnson on
July 31, it was obvious the National League playoffs would be
something special and that's proved true, especially after the San
Diego Padres' thrilling 3-2, 10-inning victory against the Atlanta
Braves that ran into early yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only getting started now that the Braves face the
sobering reality of being upset in the National League Championship
Series for the second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that will grab some people's attention around here.
Wednesday night's announced crowd of 42,117 _ 9,000 short of a
sellout _ was the smallest in Braves postseason history, a sure
sign Atlanta's success is starting to be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Many more thousands refused to sit through the two-hour rain
delay. When Game 1 finally started at 10:16 p.m. Atlanta time, too
much of the upper deck at Turner Field was empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rain took something away from the crowd,'' Braves
third baseman Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dismaying was Ted Turner and Jane Fonda, not to
mention Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter _ familiar figures here come
playoff time _ were nowhere to be seen. The Los Angeles Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal showed up, but what else does he have to do
besides walk a picket line?
</P>
<P>
   Those who stayed home to agonize over the NBA lockout missed a
superb baseball game, starting with a brilliant seven-inning
pitching duel between the Braves' John Smoltz and the Padres' Andy
Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only a tasty appetizer, and by the time the game
was over, almost everybody had forgotten about Braves right fielder
Michael Tucker's terrific catch at the warning track to take a
fifth-inning, two-run double away from Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   More memorable was Ruben Rivera's eighth-inning exploits after a
leadoff double against Smoltz. He raced to third on Ken Caminiti's
fly ball to right-center, just beating center fielder Andruw Jones'
throw with a headfirst slide.
</P>
<P>
   He then scored the go-ahead run on Jim Leyritz's one-hop
grounder to the left of the mound. Reliever Dennis Martinez looked
Rivera back to third, then lobbed a throw over to first. Rivera
broke for home, first baseman Andres Galarraga came off the bag to
take the throw, then threw wildly to the plate, allowing the run to
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make a perfect throw and I hurried it,''
Galarraga said in the gloomy Braves clubhouse afterward.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been enough, but the Braves rallied in the
ninth against Padres closer Trevor Hoffman, who was almost
unbeatable during the regular season. Andruw Jones' sacrifice fly
made it a 2-all game.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20,000 or so fans who stuck around to the end watched in
horror as Caminiti ruined the Braves' comeback with a home run off
reliever Kerry Ligtenberg in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Much was made before the series about the matchup of Hoffman vs.
Ligtenberg, but, as Hoffman said, ``We didn't look good, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg's performance earned him a place of honor in Braves
postseason history. For all the praise heaped on Atlanta's starting
pitching, Braves fans agonize more over a list of relievers who
have given up crucial home runs in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charlie Leibrandt giving up an 11th-inning home run to
Minnesota's Kirby Puckett in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series, and
Jeff Reardon, who gave up Ed Sprague's game-winning home run for
the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 2 of the 1992 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mark Wohlers, a particular favorite here. He
allowed a critical home run to Lenny Dykstra in the 1993 NLCS and
the infamous three-run shot to Leyritz in the Game 4 loss to the
New York Yankees in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Ligtenberg threw great, except for one pitch,''
Braves manager Bobby Cox said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's weak throw on Leyritz's ball was a bigger sin, just
not as spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Those who showed up and stayed up Wednesday night will debate
that well into the off-season. But there will be more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Much more.

BIG 12 HIRES WEIBERG AS COMMISSIONER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Kevin Weiberg, with his Midwestern roots and experience
with one of the nation's top conferences, was chosen as the Big 12
Conference's new commissioner yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg, deputy commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, was the
unanimous selection of the Big 12's presidents who met here
yesterday. He had his final interview with the presidents yesterday
morning and was given the job later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin was the best person for the job,'' said Kansas
Chancellor Dr. Robert Hemenway, chair of the presidents. ``Part of
the value of his experience is that he has been with a very
successful conference. Obviously, that's attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very clear vision and very innovative ideas for the
conference going into the next century. He's extremely articulate.
He's relatively young and brings a certain degree of youth and
vigor to the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg and Virginia athletic director Terry Holland were the
two finalists interviewed by the presidents. Ohio Valley
commissioner Dan Beebe and Sun Belt commissioner Craig Thompson
were interviewed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg agreed to a three-year contract and is scheduled to
begin in early January. Hemenway declined to discuss the financial
terms, but said Weiberg would be paid a salary commensurate with
commissioners of the other major conferences. Former Big 12
commissioner Steve Hatchell, who resigned in April, earned $212,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg, 42, has spent nine years with the Big Ten Conference.
He was born in Anthony, Kan., attended college at Kansas State and
Western Illinois University and has worked at Wichita State and
Maryland before joining the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin has been here nine years, and there were few things I
didn't do without his counsel,'' Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany
said. ``He's been part of our operations, planning and execution
and I think we've been pretty successful. It's a great hire for the
Big 12.''

NATO PLANS TO INTENSIFY PRESSURE ON MILOSEVIC IN STAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO effort to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to back down is following a clear track, senior
U.S. and NATO officials said Thursday. It is designed to ratchet up
the political and military pressure, while providing him various
opportunities to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   First, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke will try to win Milosevic's
compliance during a last-ditch mission to Belgrade beginning
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Holbrooke fails or if his mission is protracted, NATO
countries will vote this weekend or early next week to increase his
leverage by giving the last required permission to the NATO supreme
commander, the Gen. Wesley K. Clark, to begin air strikes against
Serb positions and troops.
</P>
<P>
   That go-ahead _ known as an activation order _ requires the
unanimous vote of all 16 NATO members. Afterwards, Clark could
proceed on his own timetable. But first NATO intends to make a
significant display of its preparations _ the forward deployment of
attack aircraft, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The military plan has already been agreed upon: a series of
phased attacks, intensifying at each step, with pauses built in to
allow Milosevic and his military commanders to back down.
</P>
<P>
   The last phase, which would involve a very intensive attack on
military installations anywhere in Serbia may require another NATO
political vote first, the officials say. The same pattern held true
when NATO bombed Milosevic to the bargaining table in 1995, over
Bosnia, and NATO never did have to go to the final stage of its
attack.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic does not respond to the pressure, he faces severe
punishment, said Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel
Berger. ``If he simply intends to defy the will of the
international community,'' he said, NATO's goal will be ``to
destroy his capacity to inflict violent repression on the
Kosovars.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Milosevic's main backing is in the security forces and special
police, not in the regular Yugoslav military, which is not likely
to want to have its expensive air-control and command systems
blasted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's aim is not to destroy Milosevic but to persuade him to
comply. The point, a senior NATO official said, is to push
Milosevic to negotiate and to allow aid to get to the refugees and
enable them to go home. ``NATO has no intention of going to war
against Serbia or on behalf of an independent Kosovo,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, the Clinton administration official said, has only
pulled out of Kosovo about 60 percent of the troops and special
police that NATO is insisting leave. Milosevic must withdraw the
forces sent into Kosovo since February and keep in barracks the
forces normally stationed in Kosovo, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before February, there were 12,500 troops in Kosovo and some
6,500 special police, U.S. officials said. After the buildup and a
partial withdrawal, there are still some 18,000 troops and 11,000
special police, the officials said, and while some of the troops
are in barracks, none of the special police are.
</P>
<P>
   A new rift is emerging within NATO, however, officials said. If
Milosevic complies, NATO wants clear verification procedures to
monitor his continued compliance, so that his troops don't pour
back in to Kosovo. To do that, the West will need more than the 50
or so diplomatic observers currently in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO countries feel strongly that a number of NATO ground
troops must be used, in addition to troops from other
organizations, for adequate monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, reluctant for political reasons to put U.S.
ground troops into Kosovo, are against the use of NATO troops,
though the use of NATO aircraft and intelligence-gathering is
foreseen, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in the last few days that Milosevic has begun to take
seriously NATO's threat to use force, the administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO official was blunter: ``Milosevic doesn't doubt NATO's
capacity to carry out these attacks, but he does doubt our will. We
have to convince him. He's tuned out to hints, obviously. So the
question becomes whether you just have to shout more loudly, or
actually hit him before he gets the point.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ For one final moment, the young boy who grew up in
Highland Park and became a national football legend came back home
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it must have seemed to an estimated 900 friends and
admirers who filled Highland Park Presbyterian Church to pay final
tribute to Doak Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 71, the former SMU All-American and Pro Football Hall of
Fame inductee, died Sept. 27 of complications from a January skiing
accident that left him paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   And when the memorial service was over, old friend and teammate
Raleigh Blakely smiled and posed a simple question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you suppose it is that after 50 years, so many people
still care about Doak Walker?'' Blakely said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was that the feeling for Walker wasn't for a guy
who scored a lot of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps best expressed in a poem sent by another former
teammate, Kyle Rote, which spoke of ``the seeds of decency you have
sown throughout your life ...''
</P>
<P>
   It was a theme that predominated eulogies delivered by
sportscaster Verne Lundquist, family friend Rod Hanna and former
SMU Vice President Bill Lively, one of the founders of the Doak
Walker Award.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the stage near the pulpit were two objects
illustrative of Walker's life _ his 1948 Heisman Trophy and a
cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing down, Lundquist said, ``This is really more about the
hat than the award.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna, a resident of Steamboat Springs, Colo., read a few of the
6,000 faxes and telegrams that poured into the hospital after
Walker's injury. ``The Doak we knew seemed almost untouched by fame
or celebrity,'' he said. ``Human relationships meant more to him
than awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundquist recalled that the last time he saw Walker, during the
summer, he was attending a friend's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of his closest friends, and Doak insisted on
attending the funeral, despite his own problems,'' Lundquist said.
``They buried her on her ranch ... and the last time I saw Doak, he
was sitting in his wheelchair in the shade of a barn, paying his
last respects to a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Lively spoke of how the man who had once inspired a generation
as ``an All-American hero'' was equally inspiring during his final
months, never losing ``the indomitable spirit that characterized
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   As friends including Tom Landry, Darrell Royal, John David Crow
and David McWilliams filed out of the church, Kansas City Chiefs
owner Lamar Hunt recalled that he was once ``just one of those kids
who wanted to grow up and wear No. 37 and be like Doak Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   For all concerned, the mood of the day was perhaps best
characterized by one of the faxes Hanna read, which said simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember ... and I thank you.''

STARS' ROAD IS LONG, INCLUDES MANY MILES OF EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Mention the negative side of his reputation, the
stuff about being selfish or locker-room trouble, and Brett Hull
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things don't bother me,'' he said yesterday at
StarCenter. ``I know me, and I know where those lies came from, and
I know they're not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the mini-war Hull once had with Mike Keenan, his
former coach in St. Louis, there is also another NHL mark against
Mr. Hull's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all my stigmas,'' he said, flashing a slow grin, ``there is
one I can't defend. Eleven years in the league and I've never been
on a \RStanley Cup\S winner. For that one, I have no argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But through free agency last summer, has Hull now found a
solution to that one ``problem''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to a great city, to play for a class
organization,'' he answered. ``But as much as anything, I wanted to
be here because you can have the best of everything, plus, be on a
team that can win the Stanley Cup. What more can you ask for in
this business?''
</P>
<P>
   Things have moved so rapidly in five seasons. It was 1993, when
out of nowhere _ meaning Minnesota _ a National Hockey League team
showed up on our unsuspecting doorstep. Strangers from Zamboniville
had entered the Chicken-Fried Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 20 years old at the time,'' said defenseman Richard
Matvichuk, ``and I can remember wondering what the heck was going
to happen to us. We didn't know anybody, and no one knew us. None
of us had any idea if this would work or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny now, because players on other teams are always
telling me how I'm lucky to be playing in one of the premier places
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   And a mere five years later, here's a recognized superstar like
Hull showing up in Dallas after deciding the Stars are his Stanley
Cup ride.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations runneth over.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a hockey publication in North America, or a Las
Vegas odds board, that doesn't list the Stars as either the best
team, or second best to Detroit, in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be the club that has everything, including more
scoring power with Hull and, yes, finally a bona fide alley fighter
in newcomer Brent Severyn. Little does Severyn know how popular
he's about to become in all local precincts. As the geeky hockey
purists scoff, the real people will love Severyn just as they once
did Shane Churla.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Nieuwendyk is healthy again _ give that a couple of
weeks _ then all pieces will be in place. And the first of many
Reunion Arena sellouts will be tomorrow night when Buffalo visits
for the regular-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   So on the eve of the much anticipated moment, what words of
coaching wisdom did Ken Hitchcock have?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to enjoy the scenery,'' was Hitchcock's answer
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The what?
</P>
<P>
   ``A long road begins Saturday, a road that will have a lot of
scenic stops along the way, and some ugly sights, too,'' said
Hitchcock. ``Travel each mile one at a time, and be sure to
appreciate the scenic view while also keeping the ugly things in
proper perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation _ don't rush the playoffs. Take nothing for granted
in six months of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   And Hitchcock also doesn't mind stressing that point. For
example:
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk said on a radio talk show earlier this week, ``Nothing
else matters except winning the Stanley Cup. That's the only
objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Matvichuk countered with, ``everything I said on the
radio the other night _ that's off the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Those comments went out on 50,000 watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' answered Matvichuk, laughing, ``it's off the record
for newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hitchcock happened to be listening to the radio that night.
Yes, he and Matvichuk talked the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point is that for now we really can't control that part of
our destiny,'' Hitchcock said. ``Injuries change so much, as we
found out with Joe \RNieuwendyk\S in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to approach this is to be thankful that we are
one of several teams that appear to have the best chance to
contend. And then, as a united hockey club, we have to go out and
prove ourselves night after night, and also hope to have some luck
in certain areas, such as injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the route, the road to the Stanley Cup starts tomorrow
night. And so do miles and miles of expectations in what is now a
hockey town.

`CRIME AND PUNISHMENT' PUTS NBC ON THE HIGH ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago it was ``Mother May I Sleep With Danger,'' ``Dead
Eyes,'' ``She Cried No'' and too much Tiffani-Amber Thiessen.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, it's Patrick Dempsey (``Can't Buy Me Love'') and
Oscar winner Ben Kingsley in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Change has come to the NBC movie division.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking it was a supernetwork that made its own rules, NBC got
arrogant a few years ago and committed grievous crimes against the
viewing public.
</P>
<P>
   But it wanted to get caught, and it was. NBC confessed,
admitting that its movies weren't up to snuff. It took its
punishment and now is attempting a redemptive flood of high-quality
TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is Raskolnikov, the tortured protagonist of ``Crime and
Punishment.'' Maybe not tortured, exactly. The comparison goes only
so far. Raskolnikov had a conscience. NBC merely follows the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were encouraging for ``Gulliver's Travels'' and
``The Odyssey,'' so the NBC moviemakers are trying their luck with
Dostoyevsky and, next month, a spruced-up version of Shakespeare's
``The Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime and Punishment'' figured to be the most daunting
challenge of the bunch. It's a dense novel in which the heady
action is just that _ heady. Most of what counts takes place
between Raskolnikov's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Raskolnikov (Dempsey) is an impoverished student in St.
Petersburg whose notion that he is extraordinary and immune to
society's laws leads to his murdering a repulsive pawnbroker and
the pawnbroker's sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ashamed of what I have done,'' Raskolnikov tells
himself afterward. ``I will not let guilt betray me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley is Porfiry, the police investigator, a role slightly
inflated from the book. French actress Julie Delpy is Sonia, a
prostitute who becomes a sort of redemptive figure for Raskolnikov.
</P>
<P>
   The first piece of disappointing news, and it's not wholly
disappointing, is that no TV movie is going to re-create the book's
pungent claustrophobia. Joseph Sargent, who directed from a script
by David Stevens, probably felt compelled to give the movie
breathing space. The result is a touch of Classics Illustrated
airiness.
</P>
<P>
   And second, Dempsey can't bring a virtually impossible screen
role to full boil. To his credit, he has the feel of the classic
Raskolnikov _ moody, cold and prideful, yet kindly at heart. Still,
Raskolnikov is a terrifically complicated character whose motives
aren't easily conveyed. Dempsey seems to drag us across the
emotional map without really settling on Raskolnikov's
psychological terrain.
</P>
<P>
   But there are overriding reasons to appreciate ``Crime and
Punishment.'' For one thing, it's beautifully filmed in Hungary,
which seems to have become a kind of Hollywood East. (The accented
English in the film is more influenced by Hungarian than by
Russian.)
</P>
<P>
   For another, the supporting roles are wonderfully cast _ not
with familiar TV names but with the right actors for the parts.
Richard Bremmer, for one, is exactly right as Arkady Svidrigailov,
the self-serving sensualist who lusts for Raskolnikov's sister,
Dounia (Lili Horvath).
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the movie is an honest shot at a classic novel. The
makers of this movie resist the temptation to reduce the story to a
cat-and-mouse game between Raskolnikov and Porfiry, killer and cop.
</P>
<P>
   That tack has been taken before, but it's not Dostoyevsky. His
is a tale of transgression _ an individual stepping outside the
circle of humanity, suffering the consequences and finding
regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   The movie concludes sentimentally, but still with enough power
to reward viewers. I do hope the audience is there. This is an
effort to do well by doing good, a concept the TV networks sorely
need to relearn.

   _ Mike Wallace and CBS News probably were trying to do good 21
years ago when ``The Homosexuals'' aired as a groundbreaking TV
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Seen today, it's a mishmash of bad science and bad sociology,
and a reminder of how far we have (or in some cases haven't)
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   The program, controversial in 1967, will be shown twice Saturday
on the CBS Eye on People cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a certain ``Reefer Madness'' hilarity in hearing
psychiatrists spew theories, later discredited, about
homosexuality. But the pain inflicted by those theories, and by the
majority's censure of homosexuality, is achingly apparent, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch out for shows called ``The Secret Life of (Whatever).''
Usually the ensuing ``secrets'' would be news only to Martians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Life of Cats,'' a ``National Geographic Explorer''
installment (Sunday on TBS) is full of such secrets as the
revelations that cats are night hunters and that they have amazing
senses of balance.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the program has a purpose _ to show that cats are
capable of an astonishing amount of damage to birds and small
mammals, and should be neutered and controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers for a good purpose, but hiss to National Geographic for
being uncharacteristically disingenuous.

PATAKI HAS BROAD STATEWIDE SUPPORT FOR RE-ELECTION AS GOVERNOR,

 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After four years as governor, George Pataki has
forged a strikingly broad appeal, propelling him to a 2-to-1 lead
for re-election over his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, who
has has barely registered in voters' minds, a statewide New York
Times/CBS News Poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, the poll also shows, has thoroughly overcome the view of
him, once widely held, as an uncaring, ideological conservative out
of step with the state, and the stigma of his having risen to power
as the protege of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, whose integrity many voters
still seriously question. The governor, who won office as the
candidate of conservatives upstate and on Long Island, now enjoys
robust support across regional and party boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the Nov. 3 election, 50 percent of voters
surveyed favored Pataki, a Republican, against 22 percent for
Vallone and 6 percent each for B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence
Party candidate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal
Party nominee. Among likely voters, the governor's lead was 54
percent to 24 percent for Vallone, the New York City Council
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The race for attorney general is in a dead heat. The Republican
incumbent, Dennis Vacco, has 38 percent to the 37 percent for the
Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer. State Comptroller Carl McCall,
a Democrat, has a wide lead over his Republican challenger, Bruce
Blakeman, 41 percent to 19 percent. One-third of voters remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, based on interviews conducted Oct. 1 to Oct. 6 with
1,066 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Vallone has been utterly unable to galvanize support,
even among Democrats and New York City residents. Just a month
before the election, a large number of voters polled simply did not
know enough to express any opinion about him, good or bad, though
he has been a leading figure in city politics for more than a
decade. And the support Vallone has is much weaker than Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such gloomy news, Vallone can take some solace in that
35 percent of voters said they might change their minds, and that
even seemingly runaway races tend to tighten by Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few bright spots for Vallone was the finding that
many voters are not yet paying much attention to this race,
suggesting that some bold stroke, however unlikely, might galvanize
their interest and tip the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the continuing high popularity in New York of
President Clinton: despite his troubles, 73 percent of registered
voters approve of his job performance. In recent days, Vallone has
made an avid defense of Clinton a centerpiece of his campaign,
making him one of the few candidates for high office anywhere in
the country to try to gain by embracing the president.

 NEW YORK: the president.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Vallone has little money left for that or any other message.
His campaign treasury reported having less than $250,000 last week,
compared with more than $9 million for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests the possibility of a landslide for Pataki,
which he and his aides hope might propel him into contention for
national office in 2000. They are acutely aware that a lopsided
victory in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 3-to-2
would raise Pataki's stature within the national Republican Party.
Only 1 in 5 New Yorkers said they would like to see him run for
president or vice president, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City, usually the safest of havens for
Democrats, the governor is running virtually even with his
challenger, at 36 percent to 39 percent for Vallone. Four years
ago, he got just 27 percent of the city vote against Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   In the downstate suburbs, which have been the swing vote in
recent elections, Pataki holds a 5-to-2 lead. And upstate, the core
of his support, he outpolls the Democrat by 5-to-1. Upstate,
Golisano runs even with Vallone, at 11 percent apiece, while Ms.
McCaughey Ross has 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pataki, a state senator, ran as the anti-Cuomo,
revealing little about himself other than his intention to cut
taxes and enact the death penalty, and relying on voters'
disaffection with Cuomo after 12 years. Even as he was winning the
race, many people had little impression of the Republican, or even
had a negative one. His image suffered from his close association
with D'Amato, who had plucked him out of obscurity to be the
Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in office _ and, to a lesser degree, his
second _ Pataki pushed through unpopular budget cuts in areas like
health care, education and mass transit. Unions and Democrats waged
an intense public-relations campaign against him, including
broadcast advertisements likening him to Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Pataki has done a remarkable job of washing away
those impressions. He has replaced them with a warmer image of
himself, built on the 1996 environmental bond act, tax cuts, large
increases in state spending in the last two years and a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign this year that has
portrayed him as likable, nonpartisan and trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that nearly as many New Yorkers now judge Pataki
to be moderate as consider him conservative, and 1 in 8 actually
regards him as liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, two weeks before he was elected, just 18
percent of registered voters had a favorable impression of Pataki.
In April 1995, three months after he took office, 27 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   But in this most recent poll, 46 percent viewed him favorably
and, perhaps more striking, just 18 percent viewed him unfavorably.
Sixty-three percent of registered voters said they approved of
Pataki's performance as governor.
</P>
<P>
   He even trumps Vallone on a question on which Democrats usually
prevail. Sixty-one percent of voters said Pataki ``cares about the
needs and problems of people'' like them, up from 40 percent in
April 1995, compared with 37 percent who said Vallone cares about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's troubles are reflected by Mary Hossman, 60, of
Woodside, Queens, one of the people surveyed. She has friends in
common with Vallone and praises the work he has done in city
government. A Democrat, she plans to vote for her party's nominee
for the Senate, Rep. Charles Schumer, in his bid to unseat D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   But she also intends to vote for Pataki. ``Originally I was
voting for him because of the death penalty,'' she said in a
follow-up interview. ``That made me take interest in him in 1994.
Then I just think he did a really good job. The economy is better
and the general quality of life is better.''
</P>
<P>
   The challengers in the gubernatorial race point to evidence that
beyond Wall Street, the state's economy lags well behind the
national boom, and complain that Pataki has somehow fooled people
into believing that New York is doing better than it is.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that New Yorkers know their state's problems
but do not blame the governor. While two-thirds of New Yorkers
described the state's economy as ``fairly good,'' just 9 percent
rated it as ``very good.'' Twenty-two percent of New Yorkers judged
the state's economy as ``fairly bad'' or ``very bad.'' That
compared with a Times/CBS News national poll taken in August that
showed 61 percent of Americans rate the national economy as
``fairly good,'' 25 percent said it was ``very good'' and 12
percent said it was fairly or very bad.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's experience mirrors that of Cuomo, who was first elected
governor in 1982 and won re-election in a landslide in 1986. Each
man was first elected in a tight contest that reflected stark
regional divisions, took office in the aftermath of a recession,
and then benefited from a strong economy and greatly broadened his
base of support in his first terms.

 &HT;    Insurance firms continue fight for records secrecy
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN,Texas _ Texas insurance companies are returning to court
today to maintain the secrecy of reports that show where they have
sold and canceled policies.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, according to a lawmaker and a consumer advocate
trying to get them, would prove insurers have rules and guidelines
that illegally prevent poorer and minority Texans from getting
affordable insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Reeves, an attorney for State Farm insurance, today will
ask state District Judge Suzanne Covington to issue a temporary
restraining order preventing the consumer advocate, Birny Birnbaum,
from getting the reports.
</P>
<P>
   State courts have already deemed the reports secret. But under a
court order and state law, legislators have access to confidential
information as long as they and their staffs sign confidentiality
statements and use the information for ``legislative purposes''
only.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, last month asked the Texas
Department of Insurance to give him the so-called quarterly market
reports showing where, by ZIP code, insurers have sold and canceled
policies. Burnam has said he's going to hire Birnbaum, a former
insurance department official, to help analyze the complex reports.
That's sparked a great uproar from insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the capability to analyze that,'' Burnam said
Thursday. He said the court action against Birnbaum ``interferes
with my ability to do my job and the right of my constituents to
have me analyze this data.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnam said he has sought other people with the expertise to
deal with the data but has found no real options.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the court action is being filed on behalf of a
number insurer companies and trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   She added that as an employee of the insurance department,
Birnbaum improperly released similarly secret company records _ a
charge he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves would not say insurers are concerned Birnbaum would
illegally release the ZIP code information, but said courts have
ruled the information secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the business of telling Representative Burnam or
any lawmaker who they can hire. Our concern is that Mr. Birnbaum is
making an effort to circumvent a court ruling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum said he is not trying to get around the court order.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum also said he did not spark Burnam's interest in the
records, but has agreed to help review the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one who is as knowledgable about it as I am,''
Birnbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one else who can help a legislator, who can
develop the type of analysis and the legislation he wants.''

 &HT;    No qualms for Quincy Carter
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ It's hard to imagine where the University of Georgia's
football team would be without Quincy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's tough to envision where Auburn and
Tennessee might be had the Bulldogs' sensational freshman
quarterback stuck with his original plan.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Carter, then a senior All-American at state
champion Southwest DeKalb High, gave Auburn coach Terry Bowden a
private commitment to play for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hush-hush deal,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   The deal wasn't hush-hush enough, however. Tee Martin, another
highly regarded quarterback considering Auburn, heard about it. He
spurned the Tigers and committed to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, when Carter switched to Georgia Tech, Auburn was
left with the lesser regarded Ben Leard of Hartwell.
</P>
<P>
   A pattern of changing plans had begun. Carter never arrived on
the Georgia Tech campus, signing a minor-league baseball contract
with the Chicago Cubs that included a no-football clause for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in the minor leagues, Carter was ready to return
to football last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I was thinking about football,'' Carter said. ``My
full concentration was supposed to be on baseball, but I would be
at the plate thinking about third down. It was a little difficult
for me. I knew for me to be a better baseball player, football had
to be in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, after Carter struggled in his second year of minor
league ball, his agent, Lonnie Cooper of Atlanta, persuaded the
Cubs to allow the outfielder to play both sports. Carter says he
didn't want to return to Georgia Tech, citing a soured relationship
with Yellow Jackets coach George O'Leary and the fact that Joe
Hamilton had established himself as the starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   So Carter contacted three schools.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with Tennessee offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe,
but the Vols already considered Martin the heir apparent to Peyton
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   He called Florida State offensive coordinator Mark Richt, who
had Dan Kendra and Chris Weinke in the Seminoles' plans.
</P>
<P>
   And he called Jim Donnan at Georgia, where starter Mike Bobo was
about to complete his eligibility and contender Daniel Cobb's
health was in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``After talking with Coach Donnan, I knew where I wanted to
go,'' Carter said. ``It was pretty evident where I was going. It
wasn't a big recruiting deal or anything. I just felt most
comfortable at Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Four games into this season, Carter is a comfortable fit for the
Bulldogs, who are 4-0 and ranked seventh entering Saturday's SEC
showdown against No. 4 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan had believed this might be a rebuilding year for the
Dogs. But Carter's early play has elevated hopes in Athens, so much
so that Georgia could make a serious run at its first SEC title
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't factor in how good Quincy was going to play,'' Donnan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter leads the SEC and is third nationally in passing
efficiency. He has thrown for 957 yards and six touchdowns with
only one interception and a 71 percent completion rate. He's also
the team's third-leading rusher with 111 yards and two scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way my coaches presented the offense to me _ they kind of
spoon-fed it to me little by little each week _ was great for me,''
Carter said. ``But I'm in awe by it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter didn't seem in awe during his biggest test _ a date at
No. 6 LSU last week. He threw for 318 yards and two touchdowns on
27-of-34 passing
</P>
<P>
   ``God has given me a lot,'' he said. ``I have innate, God-given
talent. But I can't really account for this. ... I couldn't have
imagined being the starting quarterback at Georgia (this season).''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turns 21 on Tuesday, isn't your typical freshman. He
immediately took a leadership role on the team. He directs a Bible
study every Tuesday in his dormitory room at Georgia's McWhorter
Hall. And he's taking classes for the first time in three years,
while juggling practice and media interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everything goes much faster now,'' Carter said.
``I'm always on the go, whether it's watching film, going to class
or studying. My leisure time is pretty much gone. But it's better
than sitting on the couch for six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Success in football wasn't supposed to come this fast for
Carter, who hadn't played competitively since 1995. He couldn't
practice at Georgia last spring because of restrictions placed on
his release from Georgia Tech. Carter wasn't named the Bulldogs'
starter until three days before the Sept. 5 opener against Kent,
although Donnan had circled his name as early as last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him to play good,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's teammates don't seem too surprised either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees things so well,'' safety Kirby Smart said. ``I think
he can see people out of the back of his head. He just dodges and
weaves and creates. He's a creator.''

 &HT;    Georgia won't stay normal with Vols coming to town
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. - From all outward appearances Athens has been close
to normal all week.
</P>
<P>
   But starting as early as sundown today, it wouldn't dare to
pretend normalcy. Nonchalance will give way to football fanaticism.
The sane and nonplussed will stay inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The campers and RVs will begin arriving and setting up in the
huge parking lot just off Stegeman Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will have readied its facilities for its Game Day
production at the Tate Student Center.
</P>
<P>
   The pubs and bars and restaurants in town will be hopping - some
adding extra staff to handle the extra crowds expected this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Georgia-Tennessee game is the best and biggest
excuse partiers have had here recently to let it fly. There is no
reason to suspect they will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game where business booms,'' said Jamie
Lotfon, owner of three Locos pubs/restaurants in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   It's his location off Baxter Street just up from several UGA
dorms that will probably create enough mass to form a small star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have up to 20 people working there,'' said
Lofton. ``We'll open at 10 and close at 2 a.m. We have ordered as
much (food and beer) as we can put in the coolers and hope it lasts
through the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   On most days, a bar keep and a couple of waitresses are at the
location off Baxter Street that is popular with locals as well as
students.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton said teams like Tennessee are especially good for
business because a) Many Vols fans live within driving distance and
2) as students they either had friends at UGA or visited here and
know the layout of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember three or four years ago our place would be
practically dead on Saturday night even with a home game. That's
changed, especially with the success of the team. We expect a crush
all weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown at the upscale Harry Bissett's New Orleans Cafe &AMP;
Oyster Bar the crush is expected and the excitement building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened in1986 and the only thing that compares to this
would be the year Florida came here (1995). It's going to be crazy
here,'' said manager Jim White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that around about 7 o'clock, the wait for a table
will be about an hour and, people will wait,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   White said his experience has been that in addition to the 9,500
Tennessee fans and the Georgia fans who will get into 86,117 seat
Sanford Stadium there will be the hundreds, perhaps thousand who
will come to Athens with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised how many people will come here hoping to
get a ticket and how many people will come here just to be in
Athens for this game. They'll sit in a bar and watch it on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic activity level, which is going to be a plus no
matter who wins, will gather steam as the night wears on if the
Bulldogs win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, if Georgia wins Georgia fans will be partying all
night. They won't care how much they are spending. If they lose,
Georgia fans tend to be more somber, spend less. Of course,
Tennessee fans, if they win, will want to hang around and yell,''
said White, who figures to be in a no-lose situation.
</P>
<P>
   Art Jackson, Director of the Downtown Development Authority,
said the game time and status of both teams is a merchant's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that both teams are so good means even if the weather
was bad, the stands would be full. But the weather is supposed to
be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game time (3:30) is perfect for merchants. They do not
like like 12 or 1 (p.m.) starts. They know people will come early
to park...then shop, eat and then go to the game. ``
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-Tennessee game, said Jackson, is becoming a cash cow
for downtown Athens. He reports that The Grill, a 24-hour
restaurant on College Avenue, had its highest revenue date ever for
the Tennessee game two years ago. Only the free outdoor concert by
Widespread Panic last spring came close.
</P>
<P>
   The UGA Athletic offices have been swamped by callers all week.
Media request for press box space and interviews with athletes and
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Director of Athletics Claude Felton said he's still
working on ways to accommodate the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for bar stools right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming game attracted ``about 180 to 200'' total press
including radio, TV, still photographers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   So far this week, Felton has a CBS crew of 75, ESPN Game Day
crew of 40 and 128 TV and still photographers. On top
</P>
<P>
   of that will be 200 newspaper and magazine reporters.
</P>
<P>
   This little SEC tuggle is attracting reporters from: Sports
Illustrated, USA Today, The New York Times, New York Post and New
York Daily News, the Washington Post, Boston Globe, Chicago
Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Houston Chronicle and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yea, tickets. The fact is that this game as been a
sellout since last March, according to UGA Assistant Athletic
Director Freddie Jones. But that hasn't stopped people from
calling, trying, begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here 16 years and the only thing that comes close
is the year Florida played here (1995). It's been unbelievable.
Everyone wants tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if a game has been sold out for months, who are these
people calling? People who just now got interested and didn't know
any better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say 90 percent of the calls we get are from people who
already have tickets but want one for a friend or relative.
Businesses call. Some elected officials. They know the situation. I
guess they feel they have to make that one last try. The fact is
there are none. Don't get me wrong. This is a great siutuation to
have. I hope it's like that for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the other approach - street capitalism, where
opportunists welcome the inquiries of the desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are ``letting `` their tickets go for as little as $75
each. There are actually people willing to pay $150 for a ticket.
Some say the value per ticket is even higher. The practice of
scalping is against the law.
</P>
<P>
   On campus Thursday afternoon, junior Brian Williby, a
21-year-old from Savannah, said there's ``no way I would sell my
ticket. But I know two peope who sold their's for $80 each.''
Wiliby said the two had a commitment out of town this weekend,
otherwise they'd be at the game..
</P>
<P>
   At the Tate Student Center handwritten posters showed potential
commerce. Students were making their tickets available to ``best
offer.'' Some were willling to trade their Tennessee tickets for
Florida tickets.Scalping brings up the caveats of buying from
anyone other that the UGA ticket office. There are some who
probably remember all too well buying counterfeit tickets to last
year's Auburn game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to anyone that if you buy from anyone other than us,
you are taking a chance,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The first big risk is buying a student ticket. Jones said a
person might possibly slip in, but people at the gate are going to
ask to see a student ID. The student ticket is distinct from the
nonstudent ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Georgia officials have pretty much undercut
counterfeit tickets although it's possible someone may try that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hologram on this year's ticket that is darn near
impossible to duplicate. The 'Georgia' on the ticket is a hologram.
We've tried to copy it three different ways and we couldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are buying on the street, look at the ticket carefully
before handing over any cash.

   Ticket sales remain concern for Bourne
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA TECH NOTEBOOK
</P>
<P>
   CARROLL ROGERS
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bourne, Tech's associate athletics director in charge of
ticketing, is not pretending to be happy with the announced
attendance of 35,724 at last week's Duke game at Bobby Dodd
Stadium. He's just not especially surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured we'd be between 35,000 and 40,000,'' Bourne said.
``When you have 16,000 season tickets, you're relying on a strong
walk-up gate (and) a lot of factors affect that _ the weather, the
time of day. I think (against Duke) it was time of day. Atlanta is
a difficult market (for) a noon game, we have a lot of competition,
people are tied up in a lot of events, whether it's ALTA or youth
sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I want it to be more? Sure. Do I want to find a way to
fill the stands? That's priority No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech drew even less for Duke than for non-ACC games against New
Mexico State (36,382) and Boston College (38,229), when Tech
students weren't in school yet. Take the 8,000 student tickets out
of the Duke total, and the crowd was 27,724.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has done some ``little things'' to help attract fans in the
last year. Last season TVs were installed under the East stands for
fans in the upper part of the lower level to get a better look at
the entire field. This season Papa John's pizza was brought in.
Tech uses more venders selling in the stands and more concession
stand areas.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the Duke attendance, the little things aren't
making much of a difference. But Bourne said it's too soon to tell,
adding ``A good test will be Wake Forest (Nov. 21).''
</P>
<P>
   That will be Tech's final home game of the season. There are
several thousand tickets left for next week's Virginia game, which
is usually a good draw, and it's homecoming. The Florida State game
on Oct. 24 has been sold out since the summer; many of those
tickets are bought by FSU fans in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman tackles
</P>
<P>
   After three years of Keith Brooking and Ron Rogers topping
Tech's tackle list, it's odd to see free safety Travares Tillman's
name at the top. He's leading the Yellow Jackets with 27 tackles.
Coach George O'Leary isn't concerned though that a member of the
secondary is the top tackler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travares Tillman is a very, very good football player,''
O'Leary said. ``I hope he's involved in a lot of tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a sign that the defense is reaching its goal of
spreading around the responsibility. Bunched right near Tillman are
Jason Bostic (23), Delaunta Cameron (23), Matt Miller (22), Matt
Uremovich (21) and Jesse Tarplin (19).
</P>
<P>
   New-look defensive fronts
</P>
<P>
   For the last two games, Tech has been using some sets with three
down linemen to go along with its four-linemen base defense and the
occasional five-linemen sets. Defensive coordinator Randy Edsall
said it's part of the plan to keep offenses off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take an aggressive approach on defense,'' Edsall
said. ``There are certain things you can do to create problems for
an offense in their blocking schemes. . . . We're trying to get the
most out of our talent .
</P>
<P>
   Two steps away
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Rogers needs two yards rushing to reach the 1,000-yard
mark for his career. He's trying to join Charles Wiley (1,389) to
give the Jackets two 1,000-yard teammates since William Bell and
Jimy Lincoln in the early 1990s.

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the reporting season for corporate earnings
begins, Wall Street analysts seem to agree that profits will
decline a few percentage points in the third quarter, ending an
almost seven-year run of intoxicating profit gains.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is what happens next. Will this be just a
brief headache or are earnings going to turn into a real hangover?
``It is the great issue for the market now,'' said Thomas
Doerflinger, an investment strategist at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, even if earnings growth resumes next year, will
that be enough to put the stock market back on track? The fall in
semiconductor stocks the last two days, despite indications that
the industry is turning around, may mean that even moderate gains
in profits won't be enough to satisfy the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Dow Jones industrial average recovered most of its
losses by the end of trading Thursday, the Nasdaq Composite index,
the market yardstick that measures the performance of many of the
fastest-growing and most popular technology stocks, absorbed
another sharp blow.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, investors could almost count on pleasant
surprises from companies reporting earnings that consistently
exceeded expectations. That hope now seems to be vanishing and many
investors are tuning out those strategists who continue to sing
even a mildly positive tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still looking for up earnings,'' said Byron Wien, the
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``And in
almost every conversation I have with clients, they challenge me.
`There is no way earnings will go up,' they say.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction Thursday to a new report from Abby Joseph Cohen,
the closely followed market strategist for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. who
has been a longtime bull, showed just how touchy investors were.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to Goldman clients before the stock market opened, Ms.
Cohen said that she was lowering her forecast for operating
earnings _ which are adjusted to remove the impact of one-time
writeoffs and other charges _ for the stocks in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index. That announcement helped send Wall Street sharply
lower when the market opened.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her outlook remains quite positive in a climate where
pessimism seems to be growing. She predicted that earnings for this
year would end up about 5 percent above 1997 results and she
forecast another 7 percent gain in 1999. That's down, but only a
bit, from her earlier forecast of 8 percent growth for 1998 and 8.9
percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Wien's and Ms. Cohen's forecasts show, a lot of big
names on Wall Street continue to bet that any profit dip in the
third quarter will be little more than a hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   While they are not expecting the percentile growth in earnings
to roar back to the bullish double-digit pace of the mid-1990s,
they are still counting on profits to keep improving. Douglas
Cliggott, the U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities, is
forecasting 2 percent earnings growth in 1999 even though his
firm's economists predict a mild recession next year.
</P>
<P>
   Two forces drove the stock market forward during the incredible
bull run that began in 1991. One was rapid earnings growth. The
other was the flow of billions of dollars from ordinary investors
out of other assets into stocks, powering Wall Street to record
highs this summer even as earnings growth was really slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   With the bull market in retreat, strategists are looking for
something to spur the market to climb again, to encourage investors
to gaze over the valley. A return to steady earnings growth could
fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance this week of Advanced Micro Devices and
other semiconductor stocks shows that even good earnings news may
be easily overwhelmed by uncertainty about the current economic
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Advanced Micro reported that strong sales of its
K6-2 computer microprocessor had returned the company,
unexpectedly, to profitability in the third quarter. Following
better-than-expected earnings from Motorola the day before, it was
a signal that the industry, which includes the chip giant, Intel,
might be turning around.
</P>
<P>
   But Advanced Micro's stock plunged, falling 20.8 percent
Wednesday and 11.1 percent Thursday. The Philadelphia semiconductor
index, which tracks 16 companies in the industry, dropped 3.4
percent Wednesday and another nine-tenths of 1 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to several analysts, the chance for an overall
earnings rebound requires several diverse elements to fall into
place. The economy must avoid a recession, chip makers must make a
comeback next year, energy prices need to stabilize near their
current levels and the dollar has to come down to levels that help
American exporters sell more abroad.
</P>
<P>
   All that is possible. But the price of oil, which had jumped 27
percent to $16.14 a barrel from Aug. 12 to the end of September,
has dropped back this month to $14.42 a barrel. Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, says the prospects for economic
growth are worsening. And while the dollar is down sharply against
the German mark and the Japanese yen from its highs this summer, it
remains relatively strong against the currencies of America's other
major trading partners.

   Ms. Cohen, Doerflinger and Wein are all expecting the economy to
stay out of a recession. Doerfliner is forecasting earnings growth
of almost 7 percent next year and Wien is predicting 2 percent
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen does acknowledge that Asia has still not bottomed out
and that Latin America is showing ``unexpected weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Wien said that ``the momentum of the economy is still good,
consumer confidence is still good and the Fed is easing.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the overall economy, these strategists argue that the
hardest-hit industries, like semiconductors and energy, do not need
to return to robust earnings growth but merely stop this year's
slide to push 1999 earnings higher.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doerflinger, earnings from the energy industry
plunged 29 percent in the first nine months of this year compared
with the same period in 1997. ``If energy earnings are just flat,
that would be an improvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent dollar decline will also add to the bottom line of a
lot of U.S. companies next year if its exchange rates just stay
where they are. A lower dollar means that earnings from abroad will
increase when they are translated back into cheaper dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But not all strategists share this measured optimism about
earnings. Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney, and Mitchell Held, the firm's chief economist, are
predicting a 1.1 percent decline in earnings next year. Held's
forecast is based on a weaker economy, a rally in the dollar,
continued poor performance from financial companies and downward
pressure on profit margins _ because prices can't rise much and may
even fall.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, this range of forecasts by market strategists may
not be all that comforting. But it is clearly more in line with the
current outlook and, thus, less likely to lead to the kind of
profit disappointments that have sent stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for the earnings forecasts assembled by
the hordes of analysts who predict earnings for individual
companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks. These
forecasters, according to First Call, are expecting an 18.1 percent
surge in earnings next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be happier if they were much lower,'' said Acuff.
``Then I could say that stock market prices reflect the worst.''

GUNPOWDER MARKERS NOT FEASIBLE, PANEL SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Okla., Ga.)  (jw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are no proven ways to tag or mark gunpowder
to make it more easily detectable or to deter its use in bombings,
a National Research Council panel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state of tagging technology, which has not been
extensively researched, and the relatively low level of threat from
illicit explosives using black and smokeless powders, do not
support suggestions to immediately start marking these materials,
the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-member committee said current methods for detecting
gunpowder bombs, including metal detectors and X-ray systems that
spot devices containing the explosives, and trained dogs, were
relatively effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to guard against future threats, however, the
committee believes that the government should study more complex
detection and identification methods so that policymakers are
better able to react if circumstances arise that warrant a more
aggressive response,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee called for research into promising tagging
technology, much of which was being developed by small companies,
and for the firearms bureau and the FBI to combine and expand
databases each was maintaining on gunpowders. This could be helpful
in tracing the origin of explosives used in bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in antiterrorism proposals stemming
from the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and the fatal pipe bomb
explosion at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, campaigned for wide use
of chemical markers in common explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Congress rejected these proposals and called for more study
after the National Rifle Association and other groups opposed
putting markers into black or smokeless powder, questioning the
effectiveness of tagging such widely used products and expressing
concern that foreign chemicals might affect the gunpowder's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
authorized the Treasury Department to study tagging explosives
either for early detection or to help trace explosives after
bombings. The department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
asked the National Research Council, part of the National Academy
of Sciences, to examine the issues and it convened two committees
to conduct studies.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released in March, the first committee looking at
commercial high-grade explosives, like dynamite and military
plastic explosives and chemical fertilizer used to make explosives,
concluded that it was impractical to put markers into this
material. It called for more research into cost, safety and
effectiveness questions before considering such additives for wide
use.
</P>
<P>
   The second committee, which released its report Thursday,
reached similar conclusions concerning black and smokeless powder.
</P>
<P>
   Black and smokeless powders are sold commercially primarily to
gun owners for reloading ammunition and for shooting muzzle-loading
firearms. In addition to these legitimate uses, the panel said, the
gunpowders can fuel explosive devices, most commonly pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1996, the number of reported actual and attempted
bombings involving black and smokeless powders averaged about 650
per year, the report said. In these incidents, about 10 people were
killed, 100 people injured and about $1 million in property damage
was reported annually. A significant number of those injured or
killed, the panel noted, were people involved in building or
transporting the bombs.

REPUBLICANS LIST TERMS FOR IMF PAYOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ohio)  (Eds: See also IMF-WORLDBANK) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican congressional leaders presented the
Clinton administration Thursday with a list of lending conditions
that they want imposed on the International Monetary Fund in order
for Congress to approve $18 billion in new money for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional officials said they were
hopeful that they could soon agree on compromise legislation to
provide the money to the IMF to refill reserve accounts depleted by
the fund's attempts to bail out the economies of Russia and three
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they were still without a timetable for an
agreement. Citing the turmoil in international financial markets,
the White House has insisted that the legislation be approved and
sent to the president before Congress adjourns for the year, which
could happen this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While the list of conditions being sought by the Republicans was
not made public, congressional officials said it included a demand
that the IMF open its books for public scrutiny, that it end the
practice of lending to foreign governments at below-market interest
rates, and that it shorten the lending period on most loans.
</P>
<P>
   The list was presented to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during
a meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill with the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Rubin told reporters that it had gone well.
``It was a good meeting,'' he said. ``It was very constructive and
we're just going to keep working forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the White House is reluctant to
accept any legislation that imposes onerous lending conditions on
the IMF, especially at a time when the fund needs flexibility to
avert a global financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion in new fund
financing requested by the Clinton administration. But the House
has balked at the request and has so far approved only $3.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The talks this week are aimed at satisfying House Republican
leaders, who are being pressed by conservatives within their party
who have questioned whether the economic crisis that has swept the
third world is evidence that the monetary fund has outlived its
usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been as critical about the IMF as many, but given the
crisis we have around the world, the U.S. needs to provide
leadership,'' said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a key Republican in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   He said that given the chaos in international financial markets,
the United States was left with no option but to provide the money
to the fund. ``The only real avenue is the IMF,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a new
willingness to resolve the monetary fund issue _ and to end a
variety of other financing disputes with the White House _ in hopes
of preventing a government shutdown that might distract public
attention away from the impeachment investigation of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the United States fails to provide the money other
nations might reduce their contributions, leaving the fund short of
the $90 billion it says is needed to deal with the current world
financial crisis.

 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After four years as governor, George Pataki has
forged a strikingly broad appeal, propelling him to a 2-to-1 lead
for re-election over his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, who
has has barely registered in voters' minds, a statewide New York
Times/CBS News Poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, the poll also shows, has thoroughly overcome the view of
him, once widely held, as an uncaring, ideological conservative out
of step with the state, and the stigma of his having risen to power
as the protege of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, whose integrity many voters
still seriously question. The governor, who won office as the
candidate of conservatives upstate and on Long Island, now enjoys
robust support across regional and party boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the Nov. 3 election, 50 percent of voters
surveyed favored Pataki, a Republican, against 22 percent for
Vallone and 6 percent each for B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence
Party candidate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal
Party nominee. Among likely voters, the governor's lead was 54
percent to 24 percent for Vallone, the New York City Council
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The race for attorney general is in a dead heat. The Republican
incumbent, Dennis Vacco, has 38 percent to the 37 percent for the
Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer. State Comptroller Carl McCall,
a Democrat, has a wide lead over his Republican challenger, Bruce
Blakeman, 41 percent to 19 percent. One-third of voters remain
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, based on interviews conducted Oct. 1 to Oct. 6 with
1,066 registered voters, has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Vallone has been utterly unable to galvanize support,
even among Democrats and New York City residents. Just a month
before the election, a large number of voters polled simply did not
know enough to express any opinion about him, good or bad, though
he has been a leading figure in city politics for more than a
decade. And the support Vallone has is much weaker than Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such gloomy news, Vallone can take some solace in that
35 percent of voters said they might change their minds, and that
even seemingly runaway races tend to tighten by Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few bright spots for Vallone was the finding that
many voters are not yet paying much attention to this race,
suggesting that some bold stroke, however unlikely, might galvanize
their interest and tip the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the continuing high popularity in New York of
President Clinton: despite his troubles, 73 percent of registered
voters approve of his job performance. In recent days, Vallone has
made an avid defense of Clinton a centerpiece of his campaign,
making him one of the few candidates for high office anywhere in
the country to try to gain by embracing the president.

 NEW YORK: the president.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Vallone has little money left for that or any other message.
His campaign treasury reported having less than $250,000 last week,
compared with more than $9 million for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests the possibility of a landslide for Pataki,
which he and his aides hope might propel him into contention for
national office in 2000. They are acutely aware that a lopsided
victory in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 3-to-2
would raise Pataki's stature within the national Republican Party.
Only 1 in 5 New Yorkers said they would like to see him run for
president or vice president, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City, usually the safest of havens for
Democrats, the governor is running virtually even with his
challenger, at 36 percent to 39 percent for Vallone. Four years
ago, he got just 27 percent of the city vote against Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   In the downstate suburbs, which have been the swing vote in
recent elections, Pataki holds a 5-to-2 lead. And upstate, the core
of his support, he outpolls the Democrat by 5-to-1. Upstate,
Golisano runs even with Vallone, at 11 percent apiece, while Ms.
McCaughey Ross has 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pataki, a state senator, ran as the anti-Cuomo,
revealing little about himself other than his intention to cut
taxes and enact the death penalty, and relying on voters'
disaffection with Cuomo after 12 years. Even as he was winning the
race, many people had little impression of the Republican, or even
had a negative one. His image suffered from his close association
with D'Amato, who had plucked him out of obscurity to be the
Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in office _ and, to a lesser degree, his
second _ Pataki pushed through unpopular budget cuts in areas like
health care, education and mass transit. Unions and Democrats waged
an intense public-relations campaign against him, including
broadcast advertisements likening him to Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Pataki has done a remarkable job of washing away
those impressions. He has replaced them with a warmer image of
himself, built on the 1996 environmental bond act, tax cuts, large
increases in state spending in the last two years and a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign this year that has
portrayed him as likable, nonpartisan and trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that nearly as many New Yorkers now judge Pataki
to be moderate as consider him conservative, and 1 in 8 actually
regards him as liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, two weeks before he was elected, just 18
percent of registered voters had a favorable impression of Pataki.
In April 1995, three months after he took office, 27 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   But in this most recent poll, 46 percent viewed him favorably
and, perhaps more striking, just 18 percent viewed him unfavorably.
Sixty-three percent of registered voters said they approved of
Pataki's performance as governor.
</P>
<P>
   He even trumps Vallone on a question on which Democrats usually
prevail. Sixty-one percent of voters said Pataki ``cares about the
needs and problems of people'' like them, up from 40 percent in
April 1995, compared with 37 percent who said Vallone cares about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's troubles are reflected by Mary Hossman, 60, of
Woodside, Queens, one of the people surveyed. She has friends in
common with Vallone and praises the work he has done in city
government. A Democrat, she plans to vote for her party's nominee
for the Senate, Rep. Charles Schumer, in his bid to unseat D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   But she also intends to vote for Pataki. ``Originally I was
voting for him because of the death penalty,'' she said in a
follow-up interview. ``That made me take interest in him in 1994.
Then I just think he did a really good job. The economy is better
and the general quality of life is better.''
</P>
<P>
   The challengers in the gubernatorial race point to evidence that
beyond Wall Street, the state's economy lags well behind the
national boom, and complain that Pataki has somehow fooled people
into believing that New York is doing better than it is.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that New Yorkers know their state's problems
but do not blame the governor. While two-thirds of New Yorkers
described the state's economy as ``fairly good,'' just 9 percent
rated it as ``very good.'' Twenty-two percent of New Yorkers judged
the state's economy as ``fairly bad'' or ``very bad.'' That
compared with a Times/CBS News national poll taken in August that
showed 61 percent of Americans rate the national economy as
``fairly good,'' 25 percent said it was ``very good'' and 12
percent said it was fairly or very bad.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's experience mirrors that of Cuomo, who was first elected
governor in 1982 and won re-election in a landslide in 1986. Each
man was first elected in a tight contest that reflected stark
regional divisions, took office in the aftermath of a recession,
and then benefited from a strong economy and greatly broadened his
base of support in his first terms.

 &HT;    Claybrooks boosts defense
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defensive end Felipe Claybrooks is about the last player on
Georgia Tech roster you'd expect not to have a signature post-big
play celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was on Saturday against Duke, the always flamboyant
Claybrooks, sacking the Duke quarterback and looking confused. He
took a few high steps around the backfield and also took a moment
to look for somebody to hug or something to do to express his
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Claybrooks is Georgia Tech's emotional evangelist, the one who's
up, whether it's on the scout field, during a scrimmage, or on the
sideline in a game. As he describes it, he's ``off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   But with his performance against Duke, in which he came off the
bench for a pair of sacks, seven tackles and a pass breakup, he was
the one needing some direction in cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to celebrate,'' Claybrooks said. ``One day
I'll have something patented for Felipe Claybrooks. It'll look a
lot better. All I could do was jump around.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybrooks is one of the primary beneficiaries of Tech's new
rotating defensive front, where being on the third team doesn't
guarantee there will be no playing time. In the process, he's
giving this team more than just an emotional boost.
</P>
<P>
   The redshirt sophomore started out this season as a second-team
defensive end. He sprained his ankle in the Boston College game.
That week Nate Stimson was moved from tackle to end, dropping
Roderrick Roberts to second-team end and Claybrooks to third
string. But after a talk with defensive line coach Lance Thompson,
Claybrooks, one of Tech's best pass rushers, was re-assured: get
healthy, work hard and you'll play. That's also about the time
coaches loosened their grip on defensive line substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really afraid of not playing,'' Claybrooks said. ``I'm
more worried about not playing how I'm capable of. When you come
off a game like this, they know you can do it. Now you have to
continue to perform and excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybrooks had gotten only five snaps against Boston College and
didn't play in the New Mexico State game because of his ankle. He
played 15 snaps against North Carolina, had two tackles and drew a
holding penalty. Against Duke, he played 41 snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has to work on his run game and controlling the point
of attack,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``But I see him
getting better and better. I think he played the best of the lot
Saturday against Duke. As he plays more and more, he could end up
pushing someone for a starting job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his enthusiasm, O'Leary and the coaches like it, as long
as it's not unsportsmanlike. It's a good thing because for
Claybrooks it would be hard to contain, this enthusiasm which might
be hereditary.
</P>
<P>
   Claybrooks was born to Phyllis Person, who named her second son
for Felipe Alou, her favorite Atlanta Brave, and admittedly cried
like a baby when the Braves lost in the 1992 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   She had her hands full with Claybrooks as a youngster, when he
would used his energy to aggravate his classmates, his brother and
his mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little hyper during elementary school,'' Phyllis
Person said. ``I had to go to a lot of meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he got into football and basketball, Claybrooks
had learned how to channel his energy and share it with his
teammates. He once managed to bring an entire gym full of people to
their feet playing basketball his junior year at Decatur High when
he made a length-of-the-court shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got stupid,'' Phyllis Person said. ``Everybody in the gym
went absolutely crazy, even the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her son on Saturday, Person wasn't quite sure what to do
when Claybrooks came up big with a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't jump up and run up and down the stairs like I
wanted to,'' Person said. ``I couldn't scream, shout and hug him
like I wanted to. I just said 'Yes!' ''

JUDGE DEALS ALLIED A BLOW IN AMP BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   A federal judge in Pennsylvania dealt a blow Thursday to Allied
Signal Inc.'s $9.7 billion hostile takeover bid for AMP Inc.,
ruling against Allied's current effort to seek AMP shareholders'
written consent of its purchase offer.
</P>
<P>
   Allied said it would decide on Friday whether to proceed with
the takeover effort.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixed decision handed down as the stock market closed
Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Giles called ``unlawful'' a
plan by Allied Signal to have shareholders, through written
consent, amend the company's bylaws to gain control from the board
of directors over AMP's shareholder rights plan, which includes an
anti-takeover provision, or poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who sits in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in
Philadelphia, in a decision that largely favored AMP, also left
intact the AMP board's action earlier this year to amend the poison
pill, significantly reducing the percentage of shares an investor
could buy before triggering the pill and making it non-redeemable
by any board of directors, until Nov. 6, 1999. The action was taken
after Allied announced its offer to buy the company, as well as a
tender offer to purchase up to an 18 percent stake in the company,
and become AMP's largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   But in a partial victory for Allied, the judge temporarily
prevented Allied's consent solicitation to expand AMP's board of
directors until Allied states unequivocally that ``its director
nominees have a fiduciary duty solely to AMP.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied was seeking to expand and gain control of AMP's 11-member
board of directors by adding 17 new members _ 14 who sit on
Allied's board and three Allied senior executives. It then hoped to
give shareholders control of the poison pill, and ultimately
rescind its non-redeemable clause.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that, before the stock market's recent declines,
produced the largest amount of mergers and acquisitions in history
_ most of them friendly _ Allied's hostile bid for AMP, a leading
maker of electrical connectors, based in Harrisburg, Pa., has
gained widespread attention. For one thing, Allied, a Morristown,
N.J., maker of aerospace and automotive products, is continuing to
pursue its cash offer for AMP despite Pennsylvania's reputation as
a haven for companies because of its tough anti-takeover laws.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent financial struggles, AMP's perseverance is
also noteworthy, even as a number of Wall Street analysts and
several shareholders _ including members of the founding Hixon
family _ have urged AMP to consider the Allied offer.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' initial reaction to the news was not positive. In
after-hours trading, AMP's shares quickly fell as much as 7.6
percent, to $35. Late Thursday, the stock was trading at $37.50,
down 37.5 cents. On the New York stock exchange, AMP closed at
$37.75, down 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal's stock closed Thursday at $34.50, down 18.75
cents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several investors said Thursday that the judge's decision to
uphold the poison pill was largely expected, given Pennsylvania's
reputation as one of the toughest states in the country for hostile
corporate takeovers. Pennsylvania gives corporations based there
wide latitude in whether they want to entertain unsolicited
purchase offers.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they thought that Allied could still proceed with
its takeover offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it difficult for them to proceed,'' said Morton
Pierce, a partner and head of the mergers and acquisitions practice
at Dewey Ballantine, a Manhattan-based law firm. ``Generally people
put up independent directors so you avoid conflicts of interest. In
hindsight, they should have put up an independent slate. They
certainly could pursue it with an independent slate, but they have
to be willing to live with some delay.''
</P>
<P>
   AMP officials said they were happy with the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the court has clearly recognized the
conflicted nature of the Allied Signal slate of nominees,'' the
company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   During a television interview, Allied's chief executive,
Lawrence Bossidy, said he thought Allied would be able to comply
with the judge's request and continue with its offer. Previously,
Bossidy said that Allied would rescind its offer if AMP's poison
pill was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   An Allied spokesman said that the company's lawyers were
examining the judge's ruling and that a decision would be announced
by 9 a.m. Friday about whether it would proceed with a tender offer
to purchase up to 20 million shares of AMP's outstanding common
stock for $44.50 a share. As of late Tuesday, investors owning more
than 156.7 million, or 72 percent of the outstanding shares, had
tendered them to Allied, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel that this is not a major obstacle to our consent
solicitation, then we'll go ahead,'' said Mark Greenberg, an Allied
spokesman. But ``if there's no way we can comply with the present
slate'' of director nominees, ``we may terminate the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the judge's decision will affect legislation
being considered by Pennsylvania lawmakers concerning AMP.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed
legislation containing an amendment that would allow Allied Signal
to call a special meeting of AMP shareholders to consider its
$44.50 a share purchase offer. The legislation also rescinded
severance packages, known as golden parachutes, put in place for a
number of senior executives of AMP.
</P>
<P>
   AMP has sought to thwart Allied's offer in order to allow
company executives time to show investors some results from a
recently enacted profit-improvement plan.

WHEN BAD NAMES IS GOOD NEWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Ind.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basically, two winning themes emerged in a quarter so dismal
that gains of less than 2 percent could catapult a mutual fund into
the top 10 among domestic diversified stock funds: plays on falling
interest rates, and an overall search for safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard Wellesley Income fund, with a combination of stocks
and bonds that neatly tied together both themes, ranked seventh
among diversified domestic stock funds; its quarterly return was
1.65 percent. Many of its stocks are utilities, which have come
into their own after struggling in red-hot markets.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner, the Copley Fund, took 10th place with a return
of 0.97 percent, also helped by a heavy weighting of utility
shares. Among purer plays, Strong American Utilities, up 4.89
percent, ranked fourth among specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   And a newfangled investment, Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral,
ranked sixth among diversified funds, with a return of 1.9 percent.
It aims for a steady return regardless of what happens in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the four funds talked about how they coped and
what might lie ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a good portfolio all along,'' said William H.
Reaves, who runs Strong American Utilities, with $216.5 million in
assets. ``We've just come into a period when the sun is shining on
our stocks for a change.'' Among the fund's holdings are shares in
electric utilities (38.5 percent), telecommunications (34 percent),
energy (13 percent) and gas utilities (8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The climate for utilities stocks has been particularly good, he
said, because the slowing earnings growth trend of industrial
companies and falling interest rates have made the dividends paid
by utilities companies more attractive. As of Sept. 30, the fund
yielded 2.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reaves said he had been building his position in electric
utility stocks throughout the year, ``as the deregulation process
moves along in state after state.'' One favorite is Ameren, now 7
percent of the fund's portfolio. Ameren, based in St. Louis, yields
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another large holding, 7.1 percent of the portfolio, is Nipsco,
a natural-gas and electric company based in Merrillville, Ind. ``We
see good dividend growth and 8 percent per-share earnings growth
over the next three years,'' Reaves said.
</P>
<P>
   In telecommunications, his largest position is Ameritech (8.1
percent of the portfolio). ``We expect dividend payments to
increase about 6 percent a year, and earnings per share at 12
percent,'' he said. Other favorites: Bell Atlantic (7.2 percent)
and the SBC Corp. (6.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Reaves expects the good times to continue for utilities ``as
long as we have slow growth and until the trend of interest rates
turns up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, with $310 million in assets, has
also been shining. William Jump, the portfolio engineer, aims to
buy stocks he thinks are undervalued and then ``neutralize'' the
risk by selling short (that is, selling borrowed shares of) an
equal amount of stocks he sees as overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   If the prices of the shorted stocks fall, as expected, the
borrowed securities can be replaced with shares that cost less.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the combination is intended to produce a fund with the
same risk levels as intermediate bonds, but with higher returns.
``Our goal is to beat Treasury bills by 5{ percent to 6 percent a
year, which is about 10 or 11 percent in the current interest-rate
environment,'' Jump said.

 UNDATED: Jump said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't stand out in good markets,'' he said, but ``this
is a prime environment for our fund.''
</P>
<P>
   No single holding contributed to the fund's relatively strong
performance this quarter; Jump juggles more than 700 long positions
and another 700 shorts. ``Our returns aren't driven by individual
home runs,'' he said. ``They're driven by lots of base hits.''
</P>
<P>
   All that trading pushes up the fund's turnover rate to about 200
percent, more than double that of the average stock fund. That
means transaction expenses will be high, and investors may receive
a big chunk of short-term gains, taxable at ordinary income rates,
at year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Jump focuses mostly on small and midsize companies. ``That's
where we find the greatest inefficiencies in pricing,'' he said.
About 90 percent of the fund's holdings are companies with market
capitalizations of less than $2.8 billion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we did something brilliant,'' said Earl E.
McEvoy, who manages the fixed-income portion of the $8.1 billion
Vanguard Wellesley Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``When interest rates come down and the economic outlook slows,
Wellesley does well on both the stock and bond sides,'' McEvoy
said. Wellesley's portfolio is 60 percent to 65 percent invested in
bonds; the balance, in stocks, is run by John R. Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley holds long bonds, mostly corporate (80 percent of its
bond total), with the balance in Treasuries. It has an overall
duration of nine years, meaning that the value of the bonds
increases 9 percent for every decline of one percentage point in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter, rates fell by roughly one-half percentage point,
so Wellesley's bonds gained about 4.5 percent, McEvoy figured.
</P>
<P>
   What Wellesley chose not to own also helped bolster its showing
this quarter: junk bonds, emerging-markets debt and mortgage
securities.
</P>
<P>
   On the equity side, Wellesley's holdings include utilities, 33
percent of the stock portfolio, and energy and financial stocks, 14
percent each. ``Because their dividends look stable,'' McEvoy said,
utilities are ``almost like bonds in some people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest gainers for the quarter were Amoco, up 29
percent; Consolidated Edison, which rose 23 percent, and AMP, up 22
percent.. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A tough stock market is good news for Irving Levine, manager of
the $87.5 million Copley fund, which has about 55 percent of its
portfolio in telephone, gas and electric companies, which pay the
high dividends many investors seek in uncertain times. The
next-largest chunk (12 percent) is in oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest gainers this quarter were BellSouth (up 12
percent), Ameritech and Florida Power and Light (10 percent each).
</P>
<P>
   Levine chooses his stocks carefully, then holds on. He estimates
that the fund's turnover rate for 1998 will be just 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his strong showing, Levine has a gloomy outlook for the
market. ``I think we're going to have _ not tough sledding anymore,
that's finished _ but we're certainly going to stay down at these
levels until the problems in Asia level off and Russia gets back on
its feet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Copley is also an industrial corporation that wholesales
imported handbags and shoes. As such, it can exclude 70 percent of
its dividend income from tax, so the fund pays taxes itself and
does not make any distributions to shareholders. Shareholders pay
taxes on gains only when they redeem shares.
</P>
<P>
   For most investors, this structure creates tax-adjusted returns
that are about three percentage points higher than comparable
returns on other funds, he said.

BMW M COUPE: FROM THE HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, WITH WINGS

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ``B'' movie, BMW would stitch together the M Coupe on a
dark and menacing night as lightning crackled against a castle in
deepest Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly mad scientists would scurry among test tubes and
shelves of body parts. Grave robbers would rush in with a fearsome
heart _ a 3.2-liter straight six purloined from the M works down
the road. A bulbous top would be planted on the curvaceous body of
a Z3 roadster.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, Dr. Burkhard Goschel, a BMW product manager, would
pull a lever and sparks would fly as 240 horsepower rumbled through
four exhaust tips. Engineers would recoil in horror. It's alive!
</P>
<P>
   But what on earth have they created?
</P>
<P>
   Only the fastest car BMW has ever sold in the United States, a
$42,370 Go Kart with two sport seats and room for two golf bags,
with the kind of razor-edged maneuverability that Scott Doniger,
the company's M brand manager, likened to ``a four-wheeled
motorcycle.''
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the shapely M Roadster, the M Coupe is a
wide-eyed hunchback _ think of Marty Feldman in ``Young
Frankenstein,'' but with Carl Lewis' reflexes. It is a monster that
moves.
</P>
<P>
   And however one looks at the design _ styling mishmash or
inspired insanity? _ it may appeal to those self-assured enough to
chart their own fashion course. Even someone initially cool to the
look _ evocative of George Barris' California custom cars or
perhaps a pizza delivery wagon from Toon Town _ may find himself
admiring it after a few turns at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The body is low and reptilian, with serious 17-inch tires on
9-inch-wide rims set into bulging haunches. Viewed from the rear,
slightly to the side, the pieces seem to fit and the lines have
tension; from the front, the roofline seems to belong on a
different car.
</P>
<P>
   BMW calls this a Gran Turismo coupe, an appellation once
reserved for closed-body versions of open-top sports cars, long
before ``GT'' labels appeared on Ford Escorts and Hyundai Accents.
</P>
<P>
   Even in BMW's stable, the M Coupe is the ultimate pony. It
ostensibly weighs 47 pounds more than its sister, and its body is
2.6 times stiffer, so there is none of the M Roadster's rough-road
shake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the most rigid BMW yet, the weight is
balanced perfectly, 50-50, over the front and rear wheels (the
roadster's ratio is 51-49). The suspension setups are similar, but
the coupe's wheelbase is half an inch longer, the springs are
stiffer and the rear anti-roll bar is larger. All these changes,
especially the greater stiffness, make the M Coupe behave more
predictably.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the M Coupe is lively enough that it sends amusement-ride
shivers _ hints of danger, never realized _ up the spine. The car
squats on hard acceleration, and it is a delight to hurl around.
The steering is precise and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
   With the traction control on, the rear end stayed planted while
the front tangoed through twists and turns. And turning the
traction off increased the thrills, allowing the wheels to spin and
rubber to burn while racing through the five crisp gears.
</P>
<P>
   The smooth M engine has thrust in reserve at almost any engine
speed (peak torque is 236 foot-pounds at 3,800 rpm). From a stop,
the M Coupe reaches 60 mph in a shade over five seconds, a bit
slower than a Corvette. A computer chip limits the top speed to 137
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe has its practical side. The hatch swallows enough gear
for a weekend getaway, a retractable screen hides items from prying
eyes, and a mesh net stretched behind the seats keeps cargo from
bashing the occupants when one tests the M Coupe's very forceful
brakes. But don't ruin a tire: there is no spare, just free
roadside service.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is cozy, more cocooning than the roadster's and a bit
more spacious. But the steering wheel can't be adjusted, and you
should finish your root beer before leaving the A&AMP;W _ no cup
holders.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two factory options, a CD player ($200)
integrated into the Harman Kardon stereo and a tilting glass panel
for the roof ($300). Fog lights and an automatic transmission are
not available.
</P>
<P>
   Those Sunday drivers can have their coupe and some frosting,
too, with the Z3 Coupe 2.8. For $36,770 (the same price as the
familiar Z3 2.8 in roadster form) BMW is offering the M Coupe's
body with an updated 2.8-liter engine.
</P>
<P>
   The cheaper car benefits from the stiffer fixed-roof body, but
it lacks the sport suspension that makes the M Coupe a beast, if
not a beauty. The 2.8 can also be had with an automatic, a trip
computer and the like. BMW expects to sell 800 M Coupes and 650 Z3
Coupes for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although I was initially skeptical about the need for a
closed-top Z3, and especially about the far-out design, the M Coupe
won me over. It is the most pleasing two-seat Bimmer, a rebel yell
from a company often noted for its conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   BMW says the M Coupe is ``eigenwillig,'' German for
``self-willed.'' After all, if you build a monster, why keep it on
a leash? &QL;

EISNER'S TELL-LITTLE TALE OF HIS MAGIC KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've always found that experiences from everyday life made the
best drama,'' writes Michael D. Eisner in ``Work in Progress''
(Random House, $27.95), a first-person account of his years at ABC,
Paramount Pictures and, of course, the Walt Disney Co., where he
has run things since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, much of this real-life narrative has the drama of, say, an
annual report. Here is the chief executive's message on everything
from Disney's management feuds to its millennium plans. And, yes,
there he is on the cover, posing with the Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it may be futile to expect much more from a sitting
corporate chief, especially when the corporation is an American
icon. Eisner says he wrote his book _ with Tony Schwartz, a
journalist _ as a kind of mission statement. And he discloses that
his wife, Jane Breckenridge Eisner, opposed the project, viewing
such midcareer memoirs as vain and invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would have been interesting to glimpse more of the
private man who has been behind so much popular culture. Or some
juicy, inner-circle accounts of past Disney deals or decisions. Or
a few Big Thoughts, as Disney becomes more global, about the
company's power over the world's collective imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Eisner _ whose business talents have long been well
regarded _ tells an already familiar tale about Disney, with an
emphasis on his creative contributions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he stays away from anything deeper than a
surface look at his personal life: childhood on prosperous Park
Avenue, summers at a beloved Vermont wilderness camp that taught
him ``core values,'' wholesome mischievousness at boarding school.
``I found a way to balance basic respect for authority with
youthful rebelliousness,'' he writes. (How Mickey-like.)
</P>
<P>
   Even his grief, years later, over the death of Frank Wells,
Disney's No. 2, seems glossed over, as does his ordeal with
quadruple-bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work in Progress,'' in fact, seems to let down its guard only
when discussing work experiences now safely in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner started at ABC at 24, developing soap operas and game
shows and, later, prime-time comedies like ``Welcome Back,
Kotter,'' ``Barney Miller'' and ``Happy Days.'' There he met and
worked _ sometimes quirkily _ with Barry Diller, who recruited
Eisner into the No. 2 job at Paramount Pictures in 1977 after a
decade at ABC. (We learn that Diller once clapped a hand over
Eisner's mouth to stop him from talking in front of a group.)
</P>
<P>
   At Paramount, the two were tight-fisted, producing movies as
cheaply as possible by relying on new, relatively unknown talent.
The studio made the hit spoof ``Airplane!'' for $6 million, using a
novice director, and netted $83 million; ``48 Hours,'' made before
Eddie Murphy was expensive, cost $10 million and earned $76
million. And another Murphy film, ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' was based
on an idea that Eisner says he got after being ticketed for
speeding in California.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in 1984, Eisner was dismissed _ for personal
reasons, as he tells it _ by Martin Davis, who ran Gulf &AMP; Western,
then the studio parent.
</P>
<P>
   The author's Disney years take up the bulk of the book,
beginning with the takeover battle that was raging when Roy E.
Disney approached Eisner (then at Paramount) about taking the top
post.
</P>
<P>
   As he describes his tenure at Disney _ the remade
this-is-not-your-father's Disney _ we get a sense of Eisner's
popular-culture instincts and his much-lauded business acumen: the
sharp attention to movie costs, the cross-promotions between theme
parks and retail shops, the push for a greater presence in
television.
</P>
<P>
   There is little discussion, however, of the controversies at the
company. Eisner doesn't discuss the conservative backlash against
the company's gay-friendly employee policies. (He does, however,
grapple with the ``authenticity'' issues surrounding Disney's
failed plans for an American-history theme park near Manassas, Va.)
</P>
<P>
   What we get, for the most part, is a bland presentation _ a look
at the new, grown-up films from Miramax and Touchstone, the Capital
Cities/ABC acquisition, ``The Lion King'' on Broadway, the
turnaround at Euro Disney (now Disney Paris), the cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there is a glimpse of how deals are done in the
rarefied realms of really big business: Eisner exchanges ideas on
the chairlifts at Aspen and engages in buyout banter at a top-level
executive retreat in Sun Valley. But over all, the reader gets
little in the way of an inside look at the Magic Kingdom.

OFFICER CONVICTED IN A CHOKING DEATH IS SENTENCED TO 7{ YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case that galvanized a bitter debate about
police brutality in New York City, a federal judge in Manhattan
sentenced a former police officer, Francis Livoti, to
seven-and-a-half years in prison Thursday for violating the federal
civil rights of Anthony Baez, who died after a 1994 confrontation
with police officers outside his family's home in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Livoti had caused the death of an innocent man, lied
to cover it up and sought the testimony of other officers knowing
that they would also lie, Judge Shira Scheindlin declared that no
shorter term was adequate to punish the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Livoti, you killed a man,'' Scheindlin said. ``You
disgraced the badge you wore. You will have to live with that. You
decided that you were the law, and above the law. You were terribly
wrong on both counts.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge reached her sentence after prosecutors suggested that
a term of at least 10 years would be appropriate and Livoti's
lawyer proposed a sharply lower term, of between eight and 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   Scheindlin imposed the sentence before a packed courtroom of
members of the Baez family and their supporters, and backers of
Livoti, including his family and friends, and many police officers
out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The officers sat silently and without noticeable expression as
Scheindlin also issued a broad attack on the department's handling
of Livoti's case, and said that she had refrained from imposing an
even greater sentence because the department shared some
responsibility in Baez's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department did Mr. Livoti and the people of this
city a grave injustice when it permitted Mr. Livoti to remain on
active patrol knowing of his propensity toward violence,''
Scheindlin said. ``There is no doubt in my mind that the department
knew, or should have known, that Mr. Livoti was dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that nine earlier police brutality complaints against
Livoti should have been enough ``to alert those in charge to the
fact that Mr. Livoti should be off the streets, if not off the
force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department let him remain on the streets, knowing
that one day a real tragedy would occur,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's sentence does not necessarily end the four-year
legal battle that had been waged from One Police Plaza to state
Supreme Court in the Bronx and ultimately in the U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, to affix some form of responsibility to Livoti
for the death of Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, said Thursday night that he
intended to appeal both his client's conviction and the sentence.
He said that Livoti ``really thinks that he was just performing his
duties as a cop'' the night Baez was killed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Livoti was acquitted of state charges of criminally negligent
homicide in 1996; last year, he was found by a police hearing
officer to have used an illegal choke hold to subdue Baez, and he
was dismissed from the force by Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended the
department's handling of Livoti's case, and Giuliani, in a
statement released by a spokesman, Jack Deacy, attacked the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Scheindlin's comments regarding the Police Department
during sentencing today are gratuitous,'' the mayor said, ``and
certainly don't reflect the department's excellent record in
uncovering corruption, and disciplining and dismissing rogue
cops.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor added, ``Francis Livoti is a brutal criminal who
deserves a long sentence in federal prison.''

 &HT;    Tough choices lure 31 Democrats from fold
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Charlie Stenholm (D-Texas) said it was among
the ``top most difficult'' votes of his 20 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Taylor (D-Miss.) called it about the easiest, pretty
``cut and dried,'' he said in his Mississippi drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris John (D-La.) said it was a ``juggling game,'' but in
the end he, too, voted for the Republican resolution to open an
impeachment inquiry on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between conflicting party loyalties and in some cases
difficult re-election battles at home, 31 Democrats voted with the
Republican majority to begin only the third presidential
impeachment inquiry in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who left the fold come from all parts of the
country, representing both conservative and liberal views in their
party.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some notable similarities. Nearly half, 14
members, are white, Southern Democrats representing districts with
conservative, rural constituents. More than half also belong to a
conservative group of Democrats known as the Blue Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the group of defectors are freshmen, most of whom
were elected in 1996 with a 1-2 percent margin over Republican
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Many, such as Stenholm, are engaged in tough re-election fights.
Stenholm said he wrestled with this vote as he has few others.
Though not a lawyer, he said he read everything he could about the
legal standards of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   His constituents, he said, are divided on the issue, with 50
percent saying Clinton should be impeached and 50 percent saying he
shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no right political vote for me,'' Stenholm said. ``If
you vote for it, you've got explaining to do, if you vote against
it, you've got explaining to do. The key for me ... is how I do the
explaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who voted for the GOP impeachment resolution said they
felt no pressure from the Democratic leadership or the White House
to cast a different vote.
</P>
<P>
   But some were clearly upset with the political pressure they
felt at home.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif.), a freshman elected in 1996 with
49 percent of the vote, said her Republican opponent this year has
made Clinton an issue. ``It's all he talks about,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   She said she voted for the resolution to put an end to the
controversy as soon as possible, even as she lashed out at the
Republican majority. ``The Republicans have become the party that
is the Kinko's of kinky sex,'' she said. ``All they want to do is
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a Democratic whip and one of five
Democrats who voted against both the Republican resolution and the
Democratic alternative, said he understood the predicament faced by
Democrats in ``marginal districts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to walk a fine line and not do anything to depress
their Democratic vote, but not do anything to turn away moderates
and independents who may vote for them,'' Lewis said. ``We want
(Democrats) back here (in Congress). We don't want people to fall
on their swords.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), who is seeking re-election in a solidly
Democratic district, said in a Washington Post article published
Thursday that a strict Democratic party-line vote ``will unfairly
tag our party as wanting to short-circuit what should be a
legitimate search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``If the public thinks that Democrats want to
stonewall this process, we will not be serving the best interests
of the party, the president or our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they cast what will be undoubtedly viewed as a
conservative vote, the Democrats who voted for the GOP resolution
also were quick to note that the vote did not represent a vote to
impeach Clinton, a refrain most are likely to repeat to Democratic
voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't view this as a vote for impeachment, but for a
process we have to go through,'' said freshman Rep. Nick Lampson
(D-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Not all Democrats, however, had to be brought kicking and
screaming to vote for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Rep. Paul McHale (D-Pa.), who has called for Clinton to
resign, delivered a harshly worded speech to the House. McHale
asked and was permitted to speak on the time allotted to
Republicans, not Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot excuse ... misconduct because we happen to belong to
the same party as the president,'' said McHale, noting that he
voted for Clinton in both 1992 and 1996. ``His actions were not
`inappropriate.' They were predatory, reckless and breathtakingly
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, some analysts and House Democrats predicted
that the number of party members voting for the Republican
resolution would exceed 60. But the Democratic alternative of a
more limited inquiry, made in the form of a vote to recommit the
GOP resolution, allowed virtually all Democrats to say they were
voting for an inquiry _ just not the one pushed by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And while there was no arm-twisting from the White House or
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), Democrats did apply some
subtle pressure prior to the vote. At a Democratic caucus meeting,
the leadership brought in two Democratic pollsters to share a
recent poll suggesting that Democrats who vote for the inquiry
could depress Democratic turnout Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't win,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who voted
against the GOP resolution. ``But we did darn good. We did a lot
better than many people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., meets reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday
Oct. 7, 1998 after attending a Democratic caucus. Moran, explaining
his yes vote for impeachment hearings against the president in a
morning newspaper opinion piece, said that for Democrats to oppose
an impeachment inquiry in lockstep would

 &HT;    Georgians split on party lines; Bishop sticks with Democrats
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It came as no surprise Thursday that all eight
Republicans in the Georgia delegation voted to open an impeachment
inquiry into allegations against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat unexpected, however, that Democratic Rep.
Sanford Bishop, the wild-card vote, decided against supporting the
GOP resolution.
</P>
<P>
   As the only member facing a serious election challenge in a
conservative district, many expected Bishop to support the
Republican measure calling for an open-ended inquiry into
allegations that Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice and
abused his presidential powers in an attempt to conceal his affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bishop stuck with his Democratic brethren and voted
against the Republican resolution, which passed 258 to 176. Bishop
supported the unsuccessful Democratic alternative calling for a
more limited inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been politically expedient and voted for the
Republican resolution,'' Bishop said in a statement after the vote.
``But I could not in good conscience put my personal and political
interests ahead of the well-being of the people of the 2nd District
and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Political factors might not have been entirely absent from
Bishop's decision, however. The 2nd District is more than one-third
black. Blacks have overwhelmingly said in public opinion polls that
they do not favor a continuing investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's other Democrats, Reps. John Lewis and Cynthia
McKinney, voted against both resolutions _ in effect saying no to
any type of impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has had enough,'' said Lewis, who as chief deputy
whip refused to help his party leaders build support for their
alternative because even it ``went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a stinging rebuke that she delivered against the
president only three weeks ago, McKinney on Thursday said the
president's conduct does not rise to the level of an impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The facts, McKinney said, boil down to this: A man cheated on
his wife and lied to his wife and the nation about the
relationship. Impeachment proceedings should be reserved for the
most serious of crimes, and lying about sex does not rise to that
level, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process passed by the House of Representatives today is
nothing more than a sex witch hunt _ a wide-ranging investigation
with no limits, no rules and no time completion,'' McKinney said.
``The Republicans seem hell-bent to investigate rather than
legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lewis, McKinney said the president has been punished enough
by having to look at himself every day in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Republican support for the impeachment inquiry was widely
expected, and all eight Georgia Republicans were already on record
as supporting an inquiry before Thursday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.) was quick to note that 430 House
members, both Republican and Democratic, voted for some type of
impeachment inquiry. The parties differed only on how the inquiry
should be framed, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's resounding answer by members of both parties was that
the House must fulfill its constitutional responsibility to
investigate the president's actions and determine if he has
committed `high crimes and misdemeanors,''' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) joined Democratic calls that the
inquiry be concluded quickly. ``We cannot continue down this track
for much longer,'' Chambliss said. ``It must come to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nathan Deal (R-Ga.), a former prosecutor from North
Georgia, said the inquiry should be approached with ``care and
caution.''
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia Republican Bob Barr, the vote was a moment to
relish. Almost one year after he first introduced a resolution
calling for Clinton's resignation, he was finally seeing strong
support for an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost surreal,'' Barr said. ``This is a moment of
history, a moment of truth that all Americans can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jack Kingston said two Democratic parties appeared to
be emerging from the vote's outcome, one dedicated to Clinton and
one dedicated to truth. ``I'm trying to keep restrained and keep
the lynch mob mentality out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who as speaker often refrains from
voting, cast his vote for the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), who is also a member of the GOP
leadership, said the country is going through a grieving process
over the president's admitted lie about Lewinsky. ``Most of the
nation is still in denial and wants it to go away,'' Linder said.
``But this is starting to sink in.''

RAMIREZ GAMBLE PAYING OFF FOR CLEVELAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the spring, ``The Sporting News'' designated
Cleveland Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez as ``one of the 10
worst fundamental players in all of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment did not stop there.
</P>
<P>
   That national publication ranked Ramirez No. 1 among baseball's
clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove, whose Indians face the New York Yankees
in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series at 7:08
tonight at Jacobs Field, volunteers this response:
</P>
<P>
   Get a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny Ramirez works hard daily _ offensively and defensively _
and has really done a tremendous job,'' said Hargrove, ``in making
himself one of the top two right fielders in the American League
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez will likely emerge as the
league's most valuable player for this season, but the Indians can
make a case for this shy, 26-year-old native of the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who hit .294 with 45 home runs and 145 runs batted in,
produced an MVP-type season without the embarrassing errors or
base-running gaffes that haunted him earlier during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really pushed him and rushed him,'' Hargrove said of
Ramirez, whom the Indians recalled from the minor leagues during
September 1993. ``There were a lot of people who wrote and said
that we were crazy. They might not have been that far wrong, but we
felt that we had to do that to make our club better. I think we've
been proven right in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, you get a kid learning to play the game at the
major-league level. You're going to see a lot of lapses, and that _
I think _ is as much as anything you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's shyness often prevents him from discussions, and he
eluded the national media here yesterday with success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen less and less of those,'' Hargrove said of
Ramirez's mental lapses. ``Then, they crept up and reared their
ugly head in the division series on a couple of balls that Manny
hit that were normally out. He didn't run real hard to first base.
One of them he got a single out of, and the second one was a close
play at second base for a double.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ramirez hit .357 (5-for-14) with two home runs and
three RBI during the Indians' four games with the Red Sox in the
division series. That, though, does not compare with what Ramirez
did for the Indians after first baseman Jim Thome went on the
disabled list Aug. 8 with a fracture to his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez replaced Thome as the Indians' cleanup hitter and hit
.281 with 10 home runs and 29 RBI during the 35 games Thome missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big void to fill,'' said Richie Sexson, who
replaced Thome at first base during that period. ``That was 100 RBI
and 40 home runs gone from our lineup right there. I think what
Manny did helped this team. His production doubled, and that's
exactly what we needed. What he was doing was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   That performance became another reason Indians general manager
John Hart and Hargrove defend Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too easy of a target when you see Manny make a
mistake,'' Hargrove said. ``All of a sudden, everyone goes: `Oh,
that's just Manny.' Well, that's not just Manny. Everybody else
makes those mistakes, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has just keyed on Manny because that's kind of been
his track record, but I think a lot of other people who see him on
a daily basis think that he's really grown out of that stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say Ramirez stepped onto another.

TO THE BEAT OF THE BUSINESS MEETING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)   (af)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through the business meeting, an executive gathered his
courage and stood up. Facing his colleagues across a blue
conference table, he spoke briefly about an idea, opened his
briefcase and began distributing a report that laid it all out.
</P>
<P>
   But his colleagues quickly saw that the executive had simply
dusted off a pet project that senior management had rejected long
ago. So as he gave out the reports, the men passed them to their
left and around the table until the last man just replaced them all
in the executive's briefcase. Then they started shouting at him.
</P>
<P>
   As the executive crawled under the table in embarrassment, the
men jumped out of their seats and began skipping around the table.
Was that ``Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, It's Off to Work We Go'' they were
humming?
</P>
<P>
   As a business meeting, it seemed horribly familiar, but as a
modern dance performance, it was truly something different.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-minute piece, ``The Meeting,'' will make its debut on
Saturday at a benefit for the Peter Pucci Plus Dancers, a nonprofit
Manhattan group. The performance will be at the Greenwich Academy's
Wallace Performing Arts Center in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Meeting,'' created and choreographed by Peter Pucci, is a
satirical look at business meetings, portraying their regimentation
and politics, even accompanied at one point by the sound of
bleating goats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much huffing and puffing in business meetings,''
Pucci said. ``There was a lot of material there.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Meetings are the Rodney Dangerfield of the business
world: While many good ideas come from them, meetings get no
respect. They are often dreaded, even side-stepped. Some companies
are installing conference tables with no chairs so that no one gets
comfortable during meetings. In and out, the thought is.
</P>
<P>
   After all, did Gutenberg ever attend a meeting?
</P>
<P>
   But Pucci is not just taking an easy shot at a large target. He
has asked the very targets to perform the piece. The five
performers are businessmen from Greenwich, the town that probably
has more chief executives per square foot than Wall Street. And
four of the five performers, all over 50, had no dance experience
until Pucci got them skipping around that table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got it: the pulse of a business meeting,'' Malcolm
Decker, 71, an advertising executive who performs in the piece,
said of Pucci. ``He really gets to the core of the thing. The
savagery, the competitiveness, which is, of course, masked in a
gentlemanly way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pucci, 44, has been dancing since he was 19 and has been
choreographing since 1980. He has danced in the Joffrey Ballet and
with the Pilobolus Dance Theater. He has composed works for the
Joffrey and for a Sam Shepard play.
</P>
<P>
   But people with two left feet are nothing new to him: He once
taught a man in a seven-foot bear costume to dance for a television
show and had the entire cast of ``The Merry Wives of Windsor''
dancing the mambo at a theater in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``One may find that there will be more left feet than could be
expected,'' Decker said of his performance in ``The Meeting.''
``But we rehearsed and rehearsed, and I now know that I do have a
right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Decker cheated. For the first few rehearsals, he
tagged his right pants leg with a safety pin. He said it helped.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thompson, 56, the only professional dancer in ``The
Meeting,'' said: ``To take people with no training and do this is
brilliant. It ended up being a very nice piece.''
</P>
<P>
   All the men are physically fit. They regularly taking exercise
classes at Thompson's studio and are active skiers, golfers or
tennis players. Pucci said he chose only men because he figured
that, as neophyte dancers, they would feel more comfortable
learning their moves, and making mistakes, in a men-only
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Decker, the advertising executive, recalled a meeting years ago
when he worked for the Walt Disney Co. At the meeting, he said, a
Disney executive began yelling at ABC network officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're third rate in everything you do because you're
third-rate people,' '' Decker remembered him saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that with force and conviction,'' Decker added. ``I
kind of fell off my seat. I've never heard that before. The ABC
people demurred, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Meeting'' is just as contentious, and Decker gets to fall
off his seat again.
</P>
<P>
   The piece begins with the five men going to work, walking across
the stage with their briefcases. They move to a score recorded by
Pucci that is a cacophony of voices, street noises and train
sounds. The men meet at the conference table, where, after
precision drill movements with their briefcases, they sit down to
start the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business is to cluck like chickens. After
that, the meeting becomes rowdy as the men try to get the attention
of the chief executive, played by Dr. John Tamerin, 61, as if he
were Donald J. Trump. After Earle Cote, 69, is forced under the
table, Thompson presents his report by tap-dancing on the table..
</P>
<P>
   The piece ends after the chief executive takes control and
forces everyone to read his report. While in real life, fawning
executives would probably praise their boss, the men on stage throw
the report into the air like confetti and fall on the floor asleep.
Wishful thinking, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Tamerin, a Greenwich psychiatrist, said the show was unlike any
meetings he had ever attended because he has attended so few.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life is dedicated to avoiding meetings,'' he said
with a chuckle. ``I treat people who have meetings like this.''

FRANCE SEEKS TALKS ON IRAQI CHEMICAL TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ France asked Thursday for a meeting of
technical experts at the United Nations to ``clarify'' the results
of tests its scientists carried out on Iraqi warheads. Earlier U.S.
tests had found traces of chemicals linked to VX, a deadly nerve
gas .
</P>
<P>
   Iraq denied that it put VX on warheads, and called for
additional tests, which were conducted over the summer in France
and Switzerland. Preliminary results from these tests did not find
VX.
</P>
<P>
   But several weapons experts said that final French tests
apparently found traces of VX components. Some diplomats also
charged that France had withheld these results because it did not
want to embarrass Iraq while it lobbied this week at the United
Nations to lift sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Although French diplomats have denied withholding results, and
said they expected that the final French tests would show no traces
of VX, Thursday's statement by the French Foreign Ministry neither
confirmed nor denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that French
experts would make a presentation at the meeting, now scheduled for
Oct. 22 and 23, that ``would allow an appreciation of the
scientific methods used by the three laboratories'' of the United
States, France and Switzerland. That language suggested France's
scientific findings as well as those of the Swiss may have differed
in methodology from the U.S. procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats here said, however, this may set the scene for an
inconclusive result in which no one gets blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Before sanctions are lifted, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
must be destroyed, and the U.N. Special Commission, charged with
overseeing that process, must be confident that Iraq cannot rebuild
them. Iraq has often accused the United States of making misleading
charges aimed at delaying any lifting of the punishing economic
sanctions. But if tests find traces of VX, Iraqi credibility would
be further weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq officially suspended all inspections by the special
commission on Aug. 5 and refused again on Wednesday to reopen the
way for a resumption of those forays. The United Nations said it
would not consider any action on lifting sanctions until the
inspections resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for the special commission, said the
group had planned to call for a new meeting of experts even before
the French controversy arose. ``There is the matter of sampling to
discuss and then the whole issue of VX,'' and how much of it Iraq
had produced.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and the United Nations have also clashed about one of the
special commission's chief inspectors, Scott Ritter, who quit in
protest recently, charging that the United Nations and the United
States were easing up on inspections, seeking to avoid further
confrontations with Iraq. Richard Butler, who heads the commission,
accused Ritter of divulging secrets about the commission's work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in a letter released to the press, Ritter's lawyers
asserted he has a constitutional right to speak his mind and will
continue to do so despite a threat of prosecution. The lawyers
asked Butler to ``retract'' a statement charging Ritter with
breaking the law.

 &HT;    College enrollment increases statewide
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Preliminary college enrollment figures show the
first notable increases in Texas since 1992, signaling the start of
a college-going boom predicted to hit nationally in the next few
years, education officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see the beginning of the baby boom echo,''
said Jacqueline King, director of federal policy analysis for the
American Council on Education.
</P>
<P>
   Along with an increase in the population of college-age
students, immigration is causing enrollments to swing upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``States with high immigration, such as Texas, are seeing it
first, and they are going to feel this the hardest,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every sector of higher education in Texas, public and
private, posted enrollment increases this fall, bringing the
state's total to 950,639 students, up 1.7 percent over last year,
according to data released Thursday. The numbers are likely to go
down slightly as some students drop out, said Ray Grasshoff, a
spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Texas undoubtedly will end up with overall enrollment
increases above 1 percent for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   If the uptick continues over the next decade as predicted, there
will be implications for taxpayers, students and parents across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Policy makers likely will seek more money to finance higher
education as schools try to meet the demand for everything from
classroom space to dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Public and private universities were overwhelmed this fall by
more students than expected, causing many schools to scramble for
dormitory space. Southwestern University in Georgetown and St.
Edward's in Austin were among those posting record enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, private school enrollments shot up 3.6 percent, to
102,489 students, while public colleges and universities added 0.9
percent more students than last fall, bringing enrollment to
399,812. It was the first public university increase since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Community colleges, which are expected to experience the most
dramatic percentage increases early in the next century, saw their
enrollments rise 2.09 percent, to 422,284 students. The increase at
Austin Community College was a modest 25 students, for a total
enrollment of 25,821.
</P>
<P>
   State forecasters are predicting enrollment will grow in the
range of 100,000 to 130,000 students by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big boom,'' said David Gardner, deputy assistant
commissioner of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, college enrollment is expected to rise from 14.5
million this fall to 16.08 million by 2008, according to
projections by the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner and King, however, cautioned that such predictions are
difficult to make and depend on a variety of factors. For example,
distance learning courses, the increasing cost of tuition and the
high school graduation rates of Hispanics, which are below those
ofAnglos and blacks, could all make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expected to grow, but how much will depend on how
successful we are . . . in improving the academic prospects of
Hispanic Americans,'' King said. ``If those folks are not educated,
we're going to be in big trouble'' as a society.

(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening nearly three hours of debate over whether
the House should initiate impeachment proceedings, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned Republicans and
Democrats alike Thursday that ``too much hangs in the balance for
us not to rise above partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the quarreling on the House floor was plainly partisan. So
was the subsequent vote of 258-176, as only 31 of the 206 House
Democrats joined the Republican majority and signed on to the
resolution for an open-ended impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   By sticking together, House Democrats may find it easier in the
final weeks before Election Day to portray the inquiry as a
partisan witch hunt. They can also keep their distance from an
embattled President Clinton by reminding voters that they had
backed a more limited impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that the American people, I think, got a real
eyeful of what this is all about today: a partisan vote, a
termination of debate,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who is on
the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lofgren added that voters ``have a chance to do something
about it Nov. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   While White House officials were heartened that not enough
Democrats defected to make the vote appear bipartisan,
congressional Democrats said they were spurred by a desire to unite
the party, not to help Clinton. They repeatedly noted that 85
percent of the party caucus voted together.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Democratic pollsters Stanley Greenberg and
Celinda Lake, made public on the eve of the vote, concluded that
most voters favor a congressional inquiry but that Democratic
candidates could be hurt by supporting the broader inquiry proposed
by Republicans. ``If this election is about Clinton and his
behavior, we lose,'' said an official in the Democratic
congressional leadership, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``If it's about the partisan way the Congress has handled this, I
think we do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the vote was no great triumph for the president: The
reality is that 429 representatives voted for an impeachment
inquiry in one form or another _ and that Clinton is only the third
president to be subjected to an inquiry that could lead to his
removal from office. Asked whether the House action represented a
victory for the White House, Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to the
president, replied dryly, ``I would not use that word.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the point that there was little reason for jubilation
at the White House, some Republicans went as far as to describe the
voting as bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote, in essence, was a bipartisan vote in the sense that
everybody but five members _ all but five _ voted for some form of
a resolution of inquiry,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. ``And
while we wish we could have been on the same sheet of music about
the particulars, I think everybody recognizes the matters are
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   While no lawmaker rose to defend Clinton _ and many on both
sides offered scathing criticism of his conduct _ the oratory from
the two parties was strikingly different.
</P>
<P>
   As they cheered one another on, Democrats mocked the Republican
leadership for not giving them adequate time to make their case
(some Democrats were allotted only 20 seconds). And they attacked
Republicans for demanding, as Rep. Robert Scott of Virginia said,
``an inquiry that cannot end,'' instead of tending to important
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California was among the Democrats who
recalled that Speaker Newt Gingrich had been fined and reprimanded
by the House in 1997 for ``lying under oath'' to the House Ethics
Committee about his use of tax-exempt groups for political
purposes. ``How inconsistent, then, Speaker, for this same
Republican majority to move to an impeachment inquiry of the
president for lying about his personal life,'' Ms. Pelosi said, as
Gingrich presided over the debate.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Republicans insisted that the president's
conduct was no trivial matter, and that the only way to spare the
country any more grief from the scandal was to move ahead
expeditiously with hearings. They also reminded Democrats that a
vote for the Republican proposal was not a vote to impeach _ only
to proceed with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about keeping political score,'' said Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., a member of the Judiciary Committee. ``We are here
protecting our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde responded to Democrats' complaints that he had not granted
them adequate time to review the pertinent documents by noting that
Republicans on the Judiciary Committee came to his office to devote
a total of 114.59 hours to reviewing materials while Democratic
members spent only 21.81 hours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the vote, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who is second
to Hyde on the Judiciary Committee, put forth this plea: ``I would
ask my Democratic friends to be as bipartisan today as the
Republicans were back in 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had little success, perhaps because Thursday's
proceedings could not have been more unlike those of February 1974,
when the House, by a lopsided vote of 410-4, granted the Judiciary
Committee broad powers to embark on an impeachment inquiry into
President Nixon. That debate lasted only one hour and was
relatively cordial in tone, in part because Republican leaders in
Congress supported the resolution of the Judiciary Committee
chairman, Rep. Peter Rodino. And in those days the Democrats held a
50-seat majority; the Republican edge now is a slim 21 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were certainly partisan in many, many ways,'' John Rhodes,
the Arizona Republican who was minority leader at the time, said in
an interview Thursday. ``But Republicans did not dig in their heels
and try to sabotage the effort. We didn't hate each other. And we
didn't assume that just because somebody didn't agree with us that
he was no good.''

 &HT;    Drama to high for Drudge to put drain on scene
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The historic day finally came and guess who came to
Capitol Hill to talk to Republicans about their agenda?
</P>
<P>
   None other than Matt Drudge, the fedora-wearing, online gossip
maven who is responsible for several of the more notorious
``leaks'' in the Clinton-Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled modern-day Walter Winchell with his internet
Drudge Report, a daily staple of many Washington insiders, Drudge
was invited by Georgia Republican Rep. Jack Kingston to talk to a
group of Republicans who set the morning congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was merely coincidental,'' said Kingston about Drudge's
presence on the very day that the impeachment inquiry vote was
being cast. ``On the day of the Starr report, we had Bob
Woodward,'' he said, referring to the Washington Post reporter who
broke many of the stories that led to the resingation of former
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge used the opportunity to walk the hallways of Congress,
taking off his hat to show respect to members. When Georgia
Republican Bob Barr saw him, it was a true celebrity moment, with
Barr asking him to come over for a tete a tete later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is high drama, high drama,'' Drudge said of the House
debate. ``Better than any Broadway show in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many of the veterans in the Capitol Hill press corps, the
historic day of voting ended up being fairly anti-climatic. Given
the Republican majority in the House it was forgone conclusion that
the GOP resolution would pass.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was even relaxed by some standards, despite the
partisan rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a deep drag on a cigarette during the two hours of debate
on the measure, Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner calmly
said that this was the most important vote short of going to war.
</P>
<P>
   But then, where were all the fiery speeches, the passionate
elocutions?
</P>
<P>
   They were there, Boehner said. But he did say that perhaps it
wasn't as electric as other debates because nearly every hiccup of
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair had already been reported, discussed
and dissected for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the vote on the Gulf War, I saw guys go to the well of
the House with tears in their eyes saying it was the most difficult
vote of their lives,'' Boehner said. ``We're not sending men and
women to war but this is the beginning of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is something that Barr can only smile about. After all,
Barr, who has been known to invoke the ``I'' word at every
opportunity, was the first to call for the impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Barr said he just sat smiling, thinking to
himself how funny life is. Last November Barr introduced a
resolution calling for impeachment proceedings and that was even
before the Lewinsky controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect that the Minority Leader will come over to
congratulate me, but it is nice to hear all these Democrats calling
for an impeachment inquiry,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   All day, reporters moved in clusters gathering impact from
members as tourists looked on from galleries at the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Maher, a tourist from California, said the debate made her
wince. ``I am just plain and tired of all this stuff coming out,''
she said. ``It's just sex, sex and more sex.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the debate turned to cattle calls and applause as each
side tried to score points. Noticeably absent was anyone from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion did attract members from the other chamber. Sen.
Arlen Specter, (R-Pa.), came to the House floor to watch. ``I think
it's coming our way,'' Specter said, smiling.

LITTLE PROGRESS FOR GOP AND WHITE HOUSE ON SPENDING BILLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Alaska, Mont., Idaho, Ala.)  (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their deadline just hours away, congressional
Republicans and the White House made little progress Thursday
toward resolving their differences over the must-pass spending
bills needed to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that up to 150 matters were on the table, about a
dozen of them major but all of them needing attention, and that new
issues were cropping up by the minute as the impeachment vote
dominated the stage and members sought to slip in pet projects.
These included such items as extending patent periods on various
drugs, subsidizing importers of fine wool and increasing military
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a day that we slipped backwards,'' said one top
Democratic aide Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has cleared only six of the 13 spending bills in
advance of the midnight Friday deadline, when temporary financing
of the government runs out. Both sides are expected to agree on
Friday to extend the temporary financing for at least a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in both the House and Senate were scrambling
behind the scenes and in negotiations with the White House to piece
together the remaining bills, while in public, the House voted to
begin an impeachment inquiry of President Clinton and the Senate
completed action on the spending bill for housing and veterans
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of surreal reminder of his power as president,
Clinton, on the eve of the impeachment vote, set the appropriations
back a notch by vetoing one of the six spending bills that Congress
had cleared. This was the measure covering agriculture matters and
disaster relief for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his veto message that he wanted more money for
farmers, but the veto, which he signed just before midnight
Wednesday, was widely perceived as a last-minute attempt to please
Democrats from farm states before they voted on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton wanted to give Congress
time to fix the matter before the Friday deadline. It struck
Republicans as odd, though, that he would veto the bill since
Congress had put more money into the agriculture bill than he had
requested; it was only after Democrats said they wanted more that
the president joined the cause.
</P>
<P>
   With time running out, Republican leaders said they would not
try to override the agriculture veto but would roll the bill into
the ever-expanding omnibus package that would contain other
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   But they did agree tentatively to meet some of the president's
more-publicized demands, including providing money for fuel
assistance for low-income people, for summer jobs and for child
care.
</P>
<P>
   For most of Thursday, House leaders were sequestered in
closed-door sessions deciding what to include in the omnibus and
what to exclude, leaving many members to gesture with futility
toward the speaker's office and say in a phrase repeated throughout
the Capitol that all decisions were above their pay grade.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which has yet to act on six spending bills, voted on
none Thursday. The Senate, which has seven spending bills
outstanding, easily passed the bill covering veterans affairs and
housing but never got around to the next spending bill on its
docket, the one covering the Treasury Department and the U.S.
Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so many bills remain unmoved at this point in the
process was a sign of how deeply divided Republicans are among
themselves, between the two houses and from the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most contentious bill, despite some progress
Thursday, is the one financing labor, health, human services and
education. This is the first time since Congress started funding
these agencies together more than 40 years ago that both houses
appeared unlikely to pass the labor and health bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hang-ups include millions of dollars that Clinton wants for
education, including 100,000 teachers and expanded after-school
programs. The president also wants national testing for students,
but the bill bars any steps toward that.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the outlook for the bill is a proposal floating in
the Senate to add a tobacco-related measure that would prevent the
federal government from receiving any of the money that states
receive from tobacco settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficult bill is the one financing the Interior
Department, which has passed the House but not the Senate. The
president has warned for months that he will veto the bill if it
retains the numerous ``riders'' that he calls anti-environmental.
</P>
<P>
   These include provisions to mandate an increase in nationwide
timber sales, to allow clear-cutting in Alaska's Tongass National
Forest, to allow roads to be built through wilderness in Alaska's
Isembek National Wildlife Refuge and across wetlands in Alaska, to
halt plans to reintroduce the grizzly bear into Idaho and Montana
and to mandate the renewal of grazing permits on land owned by the
Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Potential roadblocks to agreements on other bills include a
measure that the Administration says would weaken the background
checks in purchases of handguns, bar the use of money to study
global climate change and deny aid to international family-planning
groups that use their own money to advocate abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said that while numerous problems loomed,
especially over big topics like the census and the money for the
International Monetary Fund, they expected to work them out rather
than shut down the government. With the impeachment vote over,
members are increasingly anxious to get home to campaign for the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the labor subcommittee of
the appropriations committee, said his committee still had 25
issues to resolve. But Porter said a government shutdown was highly
unlikely, mainly because of the negotiating skill of Erskine
Bowles, the president's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shutdown has receded as a possibility because of the way
Erskine Bowles has approached the discussion,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, including Jack Lew, director of the
Office of Management and Budget, and Lawrence Stein, the
administration's liaison with Congress, were meeting Thursday night
with Speaker Newt Gingrich and others.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the Capitol, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
was trying to strike a deal under which Republicans would agree to
full financing of the International Monetary Fund. Republicans want
to impose conditions on the lending agency in exchange for $18
billion to shore up its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the foreign operations
subcommittee of the appropriations committee, said an agreement
could materialize by Friday. But this matter too is likely to be
tossed into the omnibus package, which would be presented to the
president on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the 31 Democrats who voted for the Republican
proposal Thursday, political pragmatism might have had as much to
do with their decision as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   All but six came from the South and Midwest. They are the ``Blue
Dog'' Democrats who often tilt Republican on economic issues and
sometimes on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, about a half-dozen or so, are in fiercely
competitive re-election races, where any surprise could send them
back into private life. They do not want to risk inspiring negative
campaign advertisements on television by appearing too soft on
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of those 31 Democrats explained their votes in speeches
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake is really the rule of law,'' said Rep. Paul
McHale of Pennsylvania, delivering one of the day's more critical
speeches. ``When the president took an oath to tell the truth, he
was no different at that point from any other citizen, both as a
matter of morality and as a matter of legal obligation. We cannot
excuse that kind of misconduct because we happen to belong to the
same party as the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio said, ``I rise today, not on behalf
of Democrats or Republicans, but as an American who is deeply
concerned that our country bring closure to the charges against the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   All but five of the 31 Democrats voted for both the Democratic
and Republican resolutions, signaling to their constituents just
how serious they were about an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   They, like their colleagues, took pains to underscore the fact
that the vote was not a call for impeachment, rather an endorsement
of a fact-gathering process. But many of them also said they
wanted, or needed, to be on the winning side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who could count knew the Democratic proposal wouldn't
pass, and the country is waiting to see if the Congress is going to
go forward with hearings,'' Kucinich said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite days of hand-wringing, and in a few cases subtle
arm-twisting by fellow Democrats and the White House, these
Democrats said they did not feel right voting against the
Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., who helped form a coalition of moderate
New Democrats, said he wanted to endorse the Republican plan
because it was modeled after the bipartisan Watergate resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On the more conservative end of the spectrum, Rep. Chris John,
D-La., who has no opponent this year, said he was concerned about
the Democrats' effort to put a time limit on the inquiry. The
Republican plan is open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to go to the next step,'' John said. ``That's
the way to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative Democrat, Rep. Jim Turner of Texas, said he
had made his vote known on Wednesday, and since then had been
fielding telephone calls both praising and condemning him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached this on a personal level,'' Turner said. ``Once
we received the Starr report, it was like being handed a football.
We've got to do something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats who voted for the proposal had more immediate
concerns. Few of them chose to talk about their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Leonard L. Boswell, D-Iowa, and a new member, faces a tough
fight in a swing district. Boswell has supported a ban on a
late-term abortion procedure and a constitutional amendment on flag
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., has found that his liberal voting
record has become a liability, and has had difficult re-election
races.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., sits in the middle of a
Republican-leaning district and faces an opponent who broadcast
anti-Clinton television advertisements just after the Lewinsky
scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Cramer of Alabama and Rep. Gene Taylor of
Mississippi are among the last white Democratic Congressmen from
the Deep South. By voting for the Republican proposal, they hope to
ensure their political survival. Cramer came within 1,200 votes of
losing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, who represents a conservative
district, has also tried his best to disassociate himself from
Clinton. His campaign tag line is, ``Our congressman. Our values.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, four of Texas' 17 Democratic Congressmen voted for the
Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Democratic delegation also broke ranks with the
party in large numbers; four of its six members voted for the
Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   As one of only two members in the 29-member democratic
California delegation who voted for the Republican plan, Rep. Ellen
Tauscher, a moderate, said her opponent had tried to capitalize on
Clinton's troubles to hurt her. Ms. Tauscher said she agonized over
the decision but, in the end, decided not ``be painted into a
corner'' by looking like she opposed an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also believe we have to do the right thing and be thoughtful
and sober about the Constitution,'' she said.

PRICE PLUNGE ON NASDAQ HITS 15-MONTH LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sparing only a couple major markets, stock prices
tumbled around the world on Thursday in emotional and often panicky
trading, reflecting investor fear that recession might be spreading
from the Far East to Europe and might eventually grip the United
States. But then Wall Street suddenly reversed course and produced
a late-session comeback in the third-heaviest trading session on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks slumped 20
percent from its mid-July peak _ the amount that has come to define
a bear market _ it bounced back to halve its loss, which amounted
to a moderate 1.16 percent. The rally also lifted the index back
above the low it set in the Aug. 31 market wipeout.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average also
was strong, ending with a decline of just 9.78 points after having
fallen 274.20 at midday. Nasdaq stocks, battered for much of the
year, also improved during the afternoon but the chief index still
lost another 2.97 percent for the day to make a 16-month low. The
Nasdaq has fallen 12 percent in the last four trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks had dropped sharply in Japan and Europe, with Tokyo's
Nikkei down 5.8 percent, erasing Wednesday's advance. Major indexes
fell 4.98 percent in Germany, 4.45 percent in France and 2.69
percent in Britain. Brazil's exchange, which finished marginally
higher, and Hong Kong's, which rose 2.5 percent, were the only
markets that escaped damage. ``Today you can cut the fear with a
knife,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist for A. G.
Edwards in St. Louis. Some of the selling, he added, was with
little consideration of price.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the depressed mood on Thursday morning was attributed to
Abby Joseph Cohen, the widely followed Goldman Sachs strategist,
who trimmed her profit estimates for S. &AMP; P. companies by $1.50, to
$49, for this year and by $2.50, to $52.50, for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said her lowered expectations would have
``little direct impact'' on stock returns because of the lowered
profits would be offset by lower interest rates and lower
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At Prudential Securities, Greg Smith, its chief investment
strategist, recommended that investors quadruple cash allotments to
20 percent of their portfolios, while Ralph Acampora, the firm's
technical analyst, sharply reduced his target ranges for the S.&AMP;P.
and the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 p.m., however, investors seemed to decide that emotional
selling had made many stocks seem like bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be at a pretty important turning point,'' suggested
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. He said it
was typical of the final stages of a downturn for dispirited
investors to try to wring some profit from shrinking portfolios by
selling stocks that had resisted the decline, such as drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
   After what McCabe called this final ``capitulation,'' the market
tends to come back, as seemed to happen during the afternoon. Merck
traded as low as 121| before rallying to close at 127, up 1 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financial companies had remarkably sharp reversals, with J.P.
Morgan up 5], to 79~ after trading as low as 72[, Merrill Lynch up
4} at 42{ after being as low as 35} and Bankers Trust recovering
from 45 to finish at 54{, up 5 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the newly minted product of the Citibank-Travelers
merger, finished at 32{, up }, after trading at 28{. ``We need a
big, hard down day to sort of clear the selling pressure,'' Richard
Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore, said during
the morning shortly after canceling a business trip in light of
further declines overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 13 of the 30 Dow industrials managed gains on
Thursday, with Kodak up 2 7/16, to 80 1/16, right behind J. P.
Morgan. The biggest Dow loser - without which the index would have
rose - was General Electric, down 3 7/16 to 71 9/16 as
third-quarter sales were lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Among Nasdaq stocks, Dell Computer swung wildly before losing 2[
to 48 7/16, Microsoft shed 2 15/16 to 91 3/16 and Yahoo dropped 9
9/16 to 104 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1.11 billion
shares, with 2,651 stocks closing lower and 615 higher. A total of
933 issues made new lows for the year compared with only 45 new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the S. &AMP; P. index was 11.24, to 959.44, barely
above the 957.28 Aug. 31 low. At its worst yesterday, however, the
index stood at 923.32, 22.2 percent below its high on July 17.

BMW M ROADSTER: PLACING LIMITATIONS ON POWER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAN NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even Michaelangelo had off days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it's not unthinkable that BMW, the master sculptor of
automotive handling and performance, could haplessly chip off the
nose _ or, more precisely, a toe _ while trying to perfect its
two-seat David, the Z3 Roadster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The engineers responsible for the M Roadster, a high-performance
variant of James Bond's shark-gille convertible, are also the one's
who engineered the M3 coupe. The M3 is widely regarded among the
string-back glove set as the world's best-handling four-seater.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the M3's bone and sinew was transplanted into the
smaller, lighter M Roadster, including the company's 3.2-liter
in-line six-cylinder engine at 240 horsepower and 236 foot pounds
of torque, disk brakes more than 12 inches in diameter, and
beautiful 17-inch alloy wheels wrapped with ultra-low-profile
Michelin tires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems like a recipe for turning the Z3 roadster _ a
glib and lively touring car _ into a masterpiece of a road-spanking
sports car.
</P>
<P>
   But the M Roadster, with an average sticker price of $45,000, is
not perfect. Under the lash of extreme driving, it is surprisingly
discombobulated. The problem is simple: BMW, in its desire to keep
the ride supple for American motorists, has sprung this car a touch
too softly for its additional power and weight _ at 3,080 pounds,
some 300 pounds heavier than the original 1.8-liter Z3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you let off the fuel before a corner, the nose dives,
transferring hundreds of pounds of weight to the front wheels and
leaving the rear wheels less weighted and more likely to slide. The
M Roadster's rear trailing-arm suspension, with less range of
motion than the coupe's multilink setup, further complicates
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sliding progressively in a hard corner, the
nine-inch-wide rear tires grip fiercely until the moment they break
traction and then lunge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, under the influence of an over-excited accelerator
foot, the car squats, lifting the front wheels and making steering
response go all wispy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The variable-assist power steering feels light and fussy,
fighting its way back to center during long high-speed turns and
requiring frequent midcourse corrections. The car's short wheelbase
_ 96.8 inches _ amplifies those corrections into moments of
breath-holding polar inertia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the M Roadster feels twitchy and unrelaxed, less
likely to pluck the heart-strings of enthusiasts than let loose a
load of butterflies in their stomachs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, if the problem is simple, the fix is simple: firmer
springs and shocks. Several after-market tuners offer just such
suspension kits, which emulate the firmer suspensions of M
Roadsters bound for the European market.
</P>
<P>
   The European M Roadsters produce a volcanic 321 horsepower,
making the American version, with 240, seem tame by comparison. But
it sure doesn't feel tame. The American M Roadster comes off the
line as if it has been swatted by a very angry Mark McGwire, going
from 0 to 60 miles an hour in about 5.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A marvelously elaborate speeding ticket awaits you at the end of
14 seconds, when you cross into three-digit territory. Anywhere in
between, the free-revving six-cylinder, mated to BMW's slick
five-speed manual transmission, stands ready to provide blasts of
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   In most other respects, the M Roadster is similar to the Z3 that
for three years has beautified our highways. The interior is
gussied up with a two-tone leather package and set off by chrome
bezels around the instruments and the shift column. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ground-hugging body cladding, dual exhausts and chrome
side-grille accents identify the M as an M, though the effect is
pretty subtle. The power top is standard and works fast and well,
though it has an odd feature that requires the driver to depress
the brake while it is operating.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control is not available on the M Roadster. The radio
reception is inexplicably spotty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What BMW doesn't know about suspensions hasn't been discovered
yet, so the setup of the M Roadster is quite deliberate; it
suggests that rather than pursue hard-core enthusiast drivers, BMW
seeks the approval of a broader market. As choices go, that was
probably very smart, sensible and safe. Alas, those words don't
begin with ``M.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: That's ``M,'' as in ``medium cool.'' &QL;

31 DEMOCRATS JOIN REPUBLICANS AS HOUSE VOTES FOR IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided House of Representatives launched an
open-ended impeachment inquiry against President Clinton on
Thursday, pushing his presidency to a new level of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The 258-176 vote, with 31 Democrats joining all Republicans,
clears the way for the House Judiciary Committee to begin televised
impeachment hearings later this year into Clinton's effort to
cover-up his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before voting to begin the inquiry, only the third in U.S.
history, the Republican-controlled House rejected a Democratic
proposal to restrict the investigation to the Lewinsky matter and
to end it by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday authorizes the House Judiciary Committee to
take whatever time is needed to investigate the president. It
places no limits on the scope of the inquiry, which would allow
examination of Clinton's business dealings and campaign fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make any judgments. We don't make any charges. We
simply begin a search for truth,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, an
Illinois Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee. ``I will
use all my strength to ensure that this inquiry does not become a
fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who reportedly did not watch the televised debate, said
after the vote that he has ``surrendered'' to whatever hand
Congress intends to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we can now move forward with this process in a way
that is fair, that is constitutional, and that is timely,'' Clinton
said. ``It is in the hands of Congress and the people of this
country _ ultimately in the hands of God. There is nothing I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   White House fears of a wholesale defection by Democratic
lawmakers did not materialize. Thirty-one Democrats, mostly
first-year members facing tough re-election challenges,
representatives of conservative districts and southerners, voted
with the Republicans for the open investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Democrats voting for the GOP resolution were from
Texas _ Reps. Ralph Hall of Rockwall, Nick Lampson of Beaumont,
Charles Stenholm of Abilene and Jim Turner of Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lofty arguments from both sides about adhering to the
Constitution and rising above partisanship, the historic debate was
laced with recriminations from Democrats and piety from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It opened with Democrats complaining that the Republican refusal
to extend the time set aside for discussing the resolution pointed
toward a partisan, perhaps unfair, investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has placed an incredibly unfair gag
rule on a constitutional debate of historic proportions,'' said
Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco. ``If this gag rule is the first test of
the Republicans' fairness in this inquiry, they have failed the
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde seemed perplexed by the hostility saying he supposed ``it
would be too much for me to expect you to appreciate'' that the
debate time had been doubled from one hour to two hours in response
to complaints from Democrats, who wanted four hours. Before it was
over, the debate had passed the three-hour mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and Rep. John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, exchanged bitter words when Hyde suggested that
Republicans had taken more seriously their job of reviewing
evidence of the Clinton-Lewinsky cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, which was forwarded to the House a month ago by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr and placed in a locked room, had
been examined a total of 114 hours by Republican members of the
Judiciary Committee and less than 22 hours by six of the 16
Democrats on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers quickly jumped to his feet. ``That really contributes to
the comity of this body. And I'm sure it's an interesting statistic
that everybody ought to know about,'' Conyers said before striding
from the chamber. Outside, he said, ``Wasn't that a cheapie?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the charges in Starr's report were too serious
to ignore. Starr accused Clinton of lying, obstructing justice and
abusing his presidential power in an effort to conceal his affair
with Lewinsky. The charges grew out of Clinton's deposition in a
sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, in which he
denied engaging in sex with Lewinsky. The Jones lawsuit was later
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The president's ``chief responsibility is to uphold the laws of
this land; he does not have the privilege to break the law,'' said
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a Sugar Land Republican who is the
only member of the House leadership to call for Clinton's
resignation. ``This is about right and wrong and upholding the
constitution and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Florida, said if House members had
declined to investigate Clinton's affair and cover-up ``then we
have undermined our Constitution and we have undermined our system
of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the speeches fell along partisan lines. Rep. Paul
McHale, a Pennsylvania Democrat who also called for Clinton to
resign, declared that the president's testimony in the Jones
lawsuit ``attempted to cover up a sordid and irresponsible
relationship by repeated deceit under oath.'' McHale said Clinton's
actions with Lewinsky were ``not only inappropriate, they were
predatory, reckless, breathtakingly arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Democrats said no impeachment inquiry was
needed. Their main complaint was that without limits, the
Republicans would not conduct a fair investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question isn't about impeachment; it's about the November
elections,'' said Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y. ``The Republicans
wouldn't touch impeachment with a 10-foot pole. They want to hound
the president for the next two years, and use impeachment as the
issue in the November elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Florida, called the Republican push for an
impeachment inquiry ``an American inquisition'' aimed at
discrediting Clinton. ``The president betrayed his wife,'' Wexler
said. ``He didn't betray his country. And God help us if we fail to
recognize the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., drew a round of partisan cheers and
hisses from the opposition when she accused Republicans of a double
standard. She looked straight at House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who
was presiding over the debate, and reminded him that in early 1997
he had admitted lying under oath to the House Ethics Committee and
had not been deposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that lying is wrong. But why the double
standard?'' Pelosi asked. ``How inconsistent, Mr. Speaker, for this
Republican majority to move to an impeachment inquiry of the
president about his personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the Democrats' position, and the enmity between the
two parties, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said: ``Our problem is
that we don't trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When he expressed concern that Republicans might try to expand
the Judiciary Committee investigation to include Whitewater,
alleged misuse of FBI files, firings in the White House travel
office and campaign finance abuses, GOP members of the House broke
out in cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice before has the House begun a presidential impeachment
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, President Richard Nixon, a Republican, resigned after
the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment over
his role in the Watergate scandal. In 1868, President Andrew
Johnson, a Democrat, was impeached by a Republican-controlled House
angry over his removal of a Cabinet officer. After a trial in the
Senate, the Republicans fell one vote short of removing him.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon case grew out of a politically inspired burglary of
Democratic headquarters at the Watergate building, an upscale
office-residential complex near the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days, the Judiciary Committee staff will
begin planning hearings and drawing up lists of witnesses, possibly
including Starr, Lewinsky, and her former friend, Linda Tripp,
whose secret tapes of Lewinsky's telephone conversations triggered
Starr's investigation of the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks ago, the president apologized for his sexual affair
and asked the nation for forgiveness in hopes of ending the threat
to his presidency. &QL;

YIELD FOR 30-YEAR RISES TO 4.99 PERCENT IN A MIXED SESSION FOR
TREASURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities ended sharply mixed Thursday,
with selling by hedge funds battering the long end of the market
even as shorter maturities were bolstered by weakness in equities.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said shorter maturities were up on expectations
of slower growth and further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Some
others said a widely publicized decision by Greg Smith, a
Prudential Securities strategist, to raise cash allocations in
investment portfolios might have helped the shorter-bill sector.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond fell 2 3/32, more than two points for a second
consecutive day, to a price of 107 23/32. The yield, which moves in
the opposite direction, rose to 4.99 percent, from 4.86 percent on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bills and shorter-term notes also gained, with the
bond-equivalent yield on a one-year bill down to 3.92 percent.
Among other long-term issues, the yield on the 10-year note rose to
4.57 percent, from 4.39 percent the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis C. Hynes, chief market strategist at R.W. Pressprich &AMP;
Co., said that Thursday's trade in bonds was certainly tied to
hedge funds liquidating speculative investments in Japanese yen, as
the yen gained on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unwinding by hedge funds has now overtaken the
flight-to-quality bid in Treasuries,'' Hynes said. ``The need to
unwind yen trades is the most dominant thing in the market right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that because the yen had rallied, it put severe pressure
on those investors who had bet on a weaker yen, a higher dollar and
a stronger Treasury market. ``When the yen rallied, the short yen
positions became unprofitable and that forced the unwinding of the
trade, which now goes in reverse, starting with the sale of
Treasuries,'' he said.

A CHAMPAGNE EVENING AWASH IN GLOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To the casual observer, the meeting of
international finance ministers and central bankers that ended here
Thursday had all the elements of a glittery affair of the type
often portrayed in movies: a mix of big money and bright thoughts
as the world's rich and powerful gather in one spot.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the gloss was gloom. With a world financial crisis
hanging over the meeting, international bankers and business
executives had to forsake their traditional bonhomie. Instead, in
the hallways, away from official seminars and in quiet voices,
international bankers here were visibly troubled by a wave of
financial woes washing from one country to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning an optimistic man,'' said David
Komansky, chairman of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who came here earlier in
the week for a day of meetings. ``By the end of the day, I wanted
to jump out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Komansky, of course, did no such thing. But his views aptly
summed up the mood. ``What I've seen is fear and people
frightened,'' he said. ``It's probably gone to a great extreme. But
people are concerned and frightened and that fear kind of feeds on
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequent visitors to the gathering, sponsored by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, said they have
never seen an atmosphere so downbeat, even though the usually
lavish parties and lengthy policy debates continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real sense of pain,'' said Sharif Ghalib, director
of sovereign rating for the London office of Standard &AMP; Poor's, a
rating agency. ``All the major financial players are criticized for
not anticipating the problems and for having no mechanisms to deal
with it. I don't recall a meeting as gloomy as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The gloom comes out in everything from gallows humor to grim
words in official speeches to the 10,000 attendees here. The
shoeshine man at the hotel where the conference is held has seen
fewer Guccis and more wingtips and worn heels, according to an IMF
newsletter circulated at the gathering. The same newsletter shows
funny pictures of conferees with one captioned: ``Do you think this
guy knows his portfolio is worthless after yesterday?''
</P>
<P>
   Official speeches were a cascade of bad news: Hans Tietmeyer,
head of Germany's powerful central bank, warned there is
``certainly no panacea for overcoming the present problems.'' He
was followed by Gordon Brown, chancellor of the Exchequer in
England, who said ``market turmoil is going to have an effect on
world growth and in Britain.'' Kiichi Miyazawa, finance minister of
Japan, talked of a ``risk of a serious deflationary spiral of the
entire world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, words like those haunt bankers from emerging markets
who came also to do business _ the raising of money for their
countries from Wall Street and European financiers. Many foreign
bankers said they are frustrated because their countries, often in
relatively good financial shape, are now being shunned by U.S.
bankers and investors who once threw money at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned,'' said Miguel Martins, a senior manager at the
International Bank of Mozambique. He said that despite solid
economic indicators, Mozambique is proving to be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, you can have a domino effect,'' Martins said. ``You
have problems in the Far East, then Russia and Latin America.
Southern Africa is showing good indicators, like Asia when it
started to boom. Yet we are being rated as though we are in second
grade. That is very frustrating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were actually two parallel gatherings going on. One hotel
had all the IMF and World Bank official meetings, with policy
presentations that drone on. At another hotel _ in what some call
the ``Shadow IMF'' _ emerging market bankers and Wall Streeters met
to cut deals.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the ``Shadow IMF'' where Merrill Lynch; J.P. Morgan;
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; Lehman Brothers; Citibank; and Credit
Suisse First Boston have set up shop in a high-class version of a
Middle Eastern bazaar. J.P. Morgan, for instance, had three days of
meetings where its salespeople and economists met with
international bankers and government officials from Colombia, the
Czech Republic, Brazil and 14 other countries. Merrill did, too.
ING Barings feted Japanese bankers and co-sponsored the 1998
``Emerging Markets CEO of the Year'' award.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this interest, international bankers said they were
being grilled like never before and feared that a ``credit crunch''
may develop, cutting off much-needed capital to help their
economies grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerging markets are scared of a credit crunch,'' said Hakan
Ates, chief executive of DenizBank, a Turkish bank. Ates brought a
multicolor presentation that he had prepared for New York
financiers, showing Turkey's strong economic-growth rates and solid
industrial output. ``Our message is `Please don't mistreat us
because of Russia,' '' Ates said. ``Due to the global crisis, they
are asking all kinds of questions about Turkey as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misery and increased cries for help for poor
countries, those making the cries and feeling the misery
participated in a social ritual that makes the IMF and World Bank
gatherings famous: lavish and, seemingly, nonstop partying.
</P>
<P>
   A limousine gridlock enveloped the city as bankers rushed from
one fancy gathering to another. The hottest ticket in town was to
the Republic Bank reception at The National Gallery, featuring the
van Gogh show.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi bankers took over the National Air and Space Museum, the
Kuwaitis the Four Seasons hotel, J.P. Morgan showed off bankers and
Impressionist paintings at the Phillips Collection and the Turkish
Bankers Association held a sumptuous feast of Turkish culinary
specialties, in amounts that looked like they could feed the entire
country.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch's gathering was at a Georgetown estate once owned
by descendants of Martha Washington's family. To highlight the
history, attendants in colonial garb played musical instruments and
announced the guests as they made their way up a cobblestone path
to an enormous tent that covered what looked to be a
wedding-in-progress. At one bar, bankers drank whisky and talked
about the crisis at Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., hedge
fund, at another, the concerns were over Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In such a beautiful setting, with liquor flowing and food in
abundance, it was hard to be entirely pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying the current world crisis is worse than World
War II or 1929,'' said a banker from Abbey National, a British
bank, who asked not to be named . ``But you've got a lot of people
looking at the problem, so surely, something will be done.''

Officials are working to keep the three top stock exchanges in
lower Manhattan. The search for new homes for the financial
industry has become a high-stakes, real estate version of musical

are also being wooed by New Jersey, try to extract subsidy packages
and New York developers maneuver to get a piece of the business.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors torn between choosing an actively managed mutual fund
and an index fund often overlook a third, lower-profile option: a
so-called sector-neutral fund. Such funds try to offer some of the
virtues of indexing, with the hope that a manager's stock-picking
skill will lead to index-beating results.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is simple. The portfolio of a sector-neutral fund
mimics the sector, or broad industry, weightings of an index that
it tracks. Within those sectors, however, a manager is free to
choose whatever stocks he likes.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, how do sector-neutral funds perform against their
indexed and actively managed siblings? There is no easy way to
tell. Neither Morningstar Inc. of Chicago nor Lipper Analytical
Services of Summit, N.J., two leading fund research firms, tracks
them as a category. Moreover, many fund companies do not even
advertise their funds' sector-neutral approach.
</P>
<P>
   But led by a smart stock-picker, such a fund can theoretically
deliver returns that outperform its index and its peers. This is
especially likely during periods of extreme market valuations,
according to Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First
Century Advisers, a New York money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a pricey market, a sector-neutral manager can dump a stock
that is included in an index and that is trading for, say, 34 times
earnings and replace it with one in the same sector that has a
lower valuation and is thus likely to outperform.
</P>
<P>
   In a cheap market, by contrast, such a manager can pick the
fastest-growing stock, regardless of its price.
</P>
<P>
   Absent hard performance data, experts also talk about one key
perceived advantage to sector-neutral investing over active
management: It eliminates the possibility, perhaps the likelihood,
that a manager will make a big bet on an industry group that blows
up. That is a particular worry during rapidly rotating markets, in
which sectors can rise and fall in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most portfolio managers are hurt by rapid rotations not
because they have picked bad stocks but rather because they have
made poor industry-sector weighting decisions,'' said Richard
Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, in a
conference call to brokers last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that sector weights nearly always have a larger
influence on portfolio performance than does individual stock
selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Sector neutrality does not, however, ward off overall
volatility. In some cases, the neutral approach can temper the
market swings that are typical for a fund's benchmark, but it can
never neutralize them.
</P>
<P>
   Like an index fund, a sector-neutral fund may be more volatile
than an actively managed portfolio because a manager typically will
not be able to overweight stable stocks like utilities even if he
expects stormy markets.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of sector-neutral funds agree on one point: Long-term
success rests on the manager's ability to pick the best stocks.
Aside from that, different strategies can be adapted to the
sector-neutral technique.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Toole, manager of the Dreyfus Premier Mid-Cap Stock fund,
has been sector-neutral for 15 years. He simply considers it a less
risky approach to active management. O'Toole uses the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 400-stock index as the benchmark for his fund _ but fewer
than half of the 400 medium-capitalization stocks in the benchmark
make the cut in the portfolio. And index equities represent only 45
percent of his fund's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only own the best-performing stocks in each sector of the
index,'' O'Toole said.
</P>
<P>
   The process seems to work for O'Toole. Dreyfus Premier Mid-Cap
Stock returned 17.3 percent, annualized, over the three years ended
Sept. 30, versus 10.8 percent for the average mid-cap blend fund,
according to Morningstar, and 16.4 percent for the S&AMP;P 400.
</P>
<P>
   For funds that track an inherently more volatile index, however,
the sector-neutral philosophy can work more as a safety net.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Turner Small Cap Growth, an aggressive-growth
fund that is closed to new investors, swapped indexes _ going from
the broadly diversified Russell 2500 to the Russell 2000 _ to skew
toward smaller-capitalization stocks. Its new index is also more
heavily weighted to the technology, health care and consumer
sectors, and will be more volatile as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But its guarantee of sector neutrality is reassuring to
investors leery of small-cap risk, said William Chenoweth, who
managed the fund from its 1994 inception until May 1998 and is now
lead portfolio manager for Nicholas-Applegate Mid Cap Growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go to sleep at night and not worry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's 12.7 percent loss for the year through Sept. 30 is
smaller than the 16.4 percent loss of the average small-cap growth
fund, according to Morningstar. Over the period, the Russell 2000
fell 16.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sector neutrality may also offer advantages for investors
looking to minimize the tax bite often caused by fast sector
rotation, said Hugh M. Neuberger, director of quantitative analysis
at Wood, Struthers &AMP; Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that gives an edge to the Winthrop Growth fund,
which he manages. Its annual turnover is just 30 percent, compared
with 120 percent for the average growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger holds just 60 stocks and uses the S&AMP;P 500 as his
benchmark _ but with a twist. Because of the fund's growth bias, he
excludes the electric and gas utility sectors, but he keeps the
weightings of all other sectors within two percentage points of the
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   His fund returned 20.2 percent, annualized, for the three years
ended Sept. 30, versus 17.6 percent for its average peer fund,
according to Morningstar, and 22.6 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who take a circumspect view of sector-neutral funds
is Jeffrey S. Molitor, director of portfolio review at the Vanguard
Group, the index fund giant. He says sector-neutral managers take
bets that investors are not aware of.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they usually invest in fewer stocks than the number
represented in their benchmark, he said, and while their sector
weightings may be closely aligned with an index, their average
market capitalizations _ another key variable _ often are not.
</P>
<P>
   Most sector-neutral funds also do not have the rock-bottom
expense ratios of the cheapest index funds. And even as
sector-neutral investing manages to reduce some downside risk, it
also limits upside potential because it precludes overweighting in
fast-growing sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while sector-neutral funds can try to pick safer
stocks within a risky sector, they cannot eliminate their exposure.
So when a particular sector crashes, the funds will, to some
degree, follow their indexes off the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to live with it,'' said Robert E. Turner,
chairman of Turner Investment Partners, the investment firm that
runs Turner Small Cap Growth and five other sector-neutral funds.
When a sector is down 7 percent and Turner's holdings in the same
sector are down just 5 percent, ``that's a victory,'' Turner said.

   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich urged him not to do it. So
did an angry Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip.
But Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., did not listen.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time Thursday for the House to vote on an
impeachment inquiry drafted by Democrats, with a deadline and
limited scope, every Republican opposed the measure. Except Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, a three-term conservative who has nettled Gingrich
before, explained his support for the Democratic option as a matter
of conscience, principle and independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted so badly for us to have a bipartisan effort in this
matter,'' Dickey said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office
after Thursday's votes. ``I was surprised when I didn't see more of
my colleagues join me'' in supporting the Democratic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said he backed the Democratic plan not for its specific
provisions but because it put the House on record in favor of a
formal investigation. Dickey said he also felt obliged to vote with
the Democrats because he had sponsored legislation to rein in the
scope and budget of federally appointed independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dickey said he wanted to show his constituents in
Arkansas that he would make up his own mind on solemn matters like
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show my constituents I wasn't afraid to go against
my party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some people in his district may still be mad at Dickey even
though he also voted for the Republican inquiry. Seventy-two
percent of his constituents want the president to resign or to be
impeached (down from 88 percent before Clinton's videotape
testimony was broadcast), the congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey has bucked the House Republican leadership before, and
has paid the price. Two years ago, Gingrich canceled a fund-raiser
in Arkansas after Dickey refused to support a spending bill that
the speaker wanted.
</P>
<P>
   As Dickey watched in amazement Thursday as every one of his
Republican colleagues rejected the Democratic plan, he said he did
not waver. Indeed, he warned his party leaders of his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeLay was very upset, and Newt said it was the wrong vote, but
it was a matter of conscience,'' said Dickey, who also consulted a
close friend, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be objective, not subjective,'' added Dickey,
who worried aloud that his vote may be misinterpreted as an ``ego
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, a 59-year-old lawyer and former travel agent and Taco
Bell restaurant owner in Pine Bluff, Ark., has defied the odds
before. He contracted polio in college but recovered fully enough
to become the top-ranked tennis player at the University of
Arkansas in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Dickey became the first Republican to win the 4th
Congressional District of Arkansas, which occupies the southern
part of the state, including Clinton's boyhood stomping grounds.
But he has no sympathy for the president, even though the two men
have known each other for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me once when I was a businessman,'' Dickey said,
``but we disagree on most all issues.''

CBS NEWS DIVISION CUTS ABOUT 7 PERCENT OF WORK FORCE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.Y., D.C., Calif., Texas, Fla.)  (jw) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As part of a broader corporate cost-cutting effort at
CBS Inc., the network's news division laid off about 7 percent of
its staff Thursday, but closed no bureaus and dismissed no
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The savings to the company will amount to close to $40 million,
or about 10 percent of the CBS News budget, according to people
familiar with the budget who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News issued layoff notices to about 120 people, most of them
in administrative or support positions, from a staff of about
1,600. Executives took pains to describe the reductions as a
reorganization rather than across-the-board cutbacks. Several
producers and correspondents said that this appeared to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, had been researching ways
to save money since midsummer, under a directive from CBS corporate
executives to all division heads to move CBS toward profitability.
All the networks except NBC lost money last year, and are expected
to do so again this year, largely as a result of higher prices they
have had to pay for entertainment shows and for football games.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and NBC News have laid off some people, too, but they
have not announced how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are consolidating management functions in our hubs in New
York, Washington, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo,'' Heyward wrote in
a memorandum to the news division Thursday. ``This means fewer
people in Dallas, Miami, Tel Aviv and Moscow, but our core news
gathering strength in those places remains intact and is expected
to increase elsewhere as this system evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system, as Heyward described it in an interview, relies
upon advanced satellite, cell phone and computer technology to link
correspondents and producers in the field to supervisors in the hub
cities mentioned in the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors in the hub cities will coordinate assignments. Most
reports will be transmitted to those cities and edited there, as
well, rather than by editors sent, with equipment, to locations
where a news event is happening.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller CBS News bureaus, in Dallas or Miami, for example,
will lose management staff _ such as a bureau chief, deputy bureau
chief and clerical staff. Instead, the bureau will have at least
one three-member ``coverage team,'' consisting of a correspondent,
camera person and producer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many producers in the larger bureaus such as
Washington (whose staff was virtually untouched) will now be
expected to work for any CBS News program, as the news cycle
requires, rather than to work for only one program, such as ``The
CBS Evening News'' or ``CBS This Morning,'' as had been done in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Also, separate assignment desks for the Northeast United States,
the national desk and the foreign desk will be consolidated into
one assignment desk, responsible for dealing with all requests for
reports or elements for reports from CBS news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Al Ortiz, the executive producer of ``The CBS Evening News,''
said, ``It puts a greater burden on producers of stories to plan a
bit more, since you won't be in the edit room to look over every
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, those in the field ``have to use their
laptops _ send scripts faster and provide more detailed instruction
about how to organize or cut a story'' to colleagues assembling
stories in the hub-city operation.
</P>
<P>
   About six weeks ago CBS Inc. said it would cut between 200 and
300 jobs by the end of 1998, including those in the news division
that were cut Thursday. No layoffs in other divisions were made
Thursday.

MEXICO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO CHARGE INTEREST ON INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Supreme Court ruled late Wednesday that it was
legal for Mexico's ailing banks to charge interest on interest. The
decision upheld a practice that is bread-and-butter basic to
banking worldwide and showed just how obsolete many of Mexico's
business laws are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to go back and re-invent our entire financial
system,'' said a relieved Carlos Gomez y Gomez, the head of the
Mexican Banking Association.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruling provoked protests from bank debtors who
had hoped to get judicial backing for a campaign to pay only the
principal and minimum interest on their debts, which ballooned when
interest rates soared to more than 80 percent during an economic
crisis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Supreme Court justices resolved a conflict
between two sets of outmoded laws _ a Commercial Code written in
1890 that authorizes compounding of interest, and a broader civil
code dating from 1928 that outlaws the practice. The civil code was
enacted after the Mexican Revolution of 1917, when private business
was regarded with suspicion and legal priorities were to protect
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``An injustice was done to the highest institution of justice,''
said Salvador Rocha Diaz, a federal senator who is also a business
lawyer. ``The court was forced to decide this fundamental issue
based on laws that do not reflect reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In an argument so convoluted that only experts could make out
its meaning, the court determined that the statutes allowing banks
to charge interest on back interest would prevail. Banking
officials said that only some countries in the Islamic world now
bar the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like Alice in Wonderland; it seems so unreal that they
didn't sort this out 100 years ago,'' said Damian Fraser, director
of research in Mexico for Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez y Gomez acknowledged that Mexican banks have been
routinely charging interest on past due interest for about 20
years, even though it was unclear whether it was legal. The banks
have also been compounding interest in favor of depositors with
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But after the crisis three years ago left many debtors reeling
under unpayable loans, their lawyers began to burrow into the
statutes to find ways out. Of about 1 million mortgages outstanding
in Mexico, some 170,000 are in litigation, according to Banking
Association figures.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to one of its basic sources of income has been
hanging over the financial system since late last year, at a time
when the banks were just getting back on their feet. Overall
capitalization had reached 17.6 percent, putting Mexican banks well
above those in most other Latin American countries, and past due
loans had finally begun to decline.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Interest rates have climbed again since July in response to the
instability of the global markets, prompting Gomez y Gomez to
recommend recently that banks should not make new loans and
customers should not seek them. This week the rate on benchmark
28-day Treasury bills, known as CETEs, was 36.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are also under siege politically since the government
fumbled an attempt to refinance its $65 billion bank bailout.
Opposition groups have tied up the government's proposal in
Congress, arguing that it asks struggling taxpayers to rescue
wealthy but incompetent bankers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual protest, members of a national debtors group
called El Barzon stood up in silence in the Supreme Court chambers
during hearings Thursday and turned their backs on the justices.
The justices ordered them removed.

FLOODS BREED HAVOC AND DISEASE IN BANGLADESH

   NEW DELHI, India _ Monsoon floods that lasted three times longer
than any other in Bangladesh's history have finally receded and
millions of people have begun cleaning the muck from their homes.
But the country is still struggling to cope with the aftermath:
hunger, disease and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   A full picture of the devastation is beginning to emerge as
researchers and government workers fan out into severely affected
areas that were largely cut off. The floods lasted more than two
months and inundated two-thirds of the impoverished country, where
120 million people live.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that 10,000 miles of roads, 14,000
schools and a million homes were heavily damaged. More than 2
million tons of rice that would have been harvested this year were
either wiped out or never planted, a fearsome loss in a country
where two-thirds of the children are seriously malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   As the mighty Padma, Jamuna amd Brahmaputra rivers have fallen
below the danger level in the past two weeks, leaving behind a
filthy sludge that nourishes disease, the number of people
afflicted by diarrhea has soared to more than 1 million, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The official death toll now stands at 918 _ mostly from
diarrhea, cobra bites and drowning _ but epidemiologists say that
number may rise to several thousand as reports come in from
outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and relief workers say adequate food and
medical supplies are arriving in Bangladesh through the port at
Chittagong. The challenge is to speed distribution to the rural
areas, where most people live.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, met Tuesday
with her Cabinet ministers and instructed them to hasten the
distribution of food-ration cards to 4 million households, many of
whom lost their ability to make a living when the floods swamped
their crops, drowned their cattle and destroyed their seed stocks.
</P>
<P>
   She also ordered that a food-for-work program to rebuild damaged
roads begin by Saturday and that a much larger reconstruction
program get under way immediately, putting money in people's
pockets and food on their tables. She has asked for $880 million in
foreign aid and has received pledges of about $129 million, the
government says.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of international relief agencies praise Sheik
Hasina's administration for removing bureaucratic obstacles, but
they also worry that it is taking too long for the rice and wheat
to pass through four levels of government to the smallest
administrative unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machinery at our disposal is a good one,'' said Werner
Kiene, representative of the United Nations World Food Program in
Dhaka, the capital. ``But we need to give it more speed, and the
food needs to be pushed through this machinery.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the difficulty of treating people with diarrhea is
not a shortage of the inexpensive life-saving solution of water,
electrolytes and sugar that replenishes depleted bodily fluids, but
delivery to sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas that are still partly flooded, the waters are now
too shallow for boats to cross but the roads are still too muddy
for wheeled vehicles to pass, said A.K. Siddique, an epidemiologist
with the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in
Dhaka. ``We are entering the most vulnerable period, when
inaccessibility is the main constraint,'' he said.

REPUBLICAN LEADS RACE FOR GLENN'S SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change the polling percentages in the 8th graf from 10 and
18 to 15 and 20, respectively.)  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he
won re-election as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote,
stunning even his most optimistic supporters and setting a
20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is barred from seeking a
third term, is running again, this time for the Senate seat held by
John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring. And while there are few who
expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four years
ago, politicians of both parties generally acknowledge that he is
well positioned to increase the Republican majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That has not prevented Voinovich's Democratic opponent, Mary
Boyle, from undertaking a vigorous campaign. Ms. Boyle, a former
commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is
crisscrossing the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she
describes as a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a
comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted to her side
nationally known Democrats _ President Clinton foremost among them
_ on the campaign trail. Glenn, the former astronaut who is
preparing to return to space this month at the age of 77, has not
made an endorsement in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning
hard on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61,
as a lackluster steward who allowed the state's schools to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised to be the education governor,'' said Ms. Boyle.
``But after seven and a half years he has failed the students of
this state.'' Her role in the campaign, she said, ``is to remind
the people of the state of Ohio that George Voinovich made a
promise and that he didn't deliver on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she discusses a decision last year by the Ohio
Supreme Court that cited wide disparities in the quality of the
state's schools and ruled unconstitutional the formula for funding
them.
</P>
<P>
   She has also attacked her Republican opponent for supporting a
proposal to raise the state's sales tax by one percent. Under that
plan, half the additional funds would have been used for school
improvement with the remainder earmarked for reducing property
taxes. That statewide ballot initiative last May proved to be
wildly unpopular, with about 80 percent of the voters opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   While the topics of taxes and education are hot ones this
political season in Ohio, it is not clear that Ms. Boyle's emphasis
on them has helped her campaign. Despite some narrowing in the
opinion polls, she is still trailing Voinovich by 15 percentage
points in some polls and as much as 20 points in others.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sharp fund-raising disparity. Ms. Boyle, who is
running her first statewide race and has widespread union support,
has raised nearly $2 million so far, far less than the nearly $7
million Voinovich has taken in. Also, Voinovich, a former
lieutenant governor, has been on statewide ballots five times over
the last 20 years and thus is the better-known candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral dynamics of Ohio are also aiding Voinovich. The
northern half of the state, with its history of industrial,
unionized cities, has a tradition of voting largely for Democratic
candidates, while the southern tier of the state is considered more
conservative and typically leans Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich and Ms. Boyle share the same home terrain,
depriving Ms. Boyle of the geographic advantage that often
accompanies Democratic candidates. Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once
delivered newspapers to the Boyle home in the working-class
Collinwood section of Cleveland. And Voinovich, a former mayor of
Cleveland, has developed a reputation as a moderate Republican who
works well with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a
full schedule of official duties, assuming the role of the
experienced, elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get into the Senate, I will probably know more about
domestic policy than any member of the Senate,'' he said in an
interview on Wednesday in Canton, sandwiched between a
ribbon-cutting ceremony and a fund-raising reception at a vacuum
cleaner museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mayor, I had my nose rubbed into the problems of urban
America and was fairly successful in dealing with them. And, as
governor, I have dealt with the problems of Medicaid, welfare and
education. I'm the only person in the United States who has been
president of the National League of Cities and chairman of the
National Governors Association.''
</P>
<P>
   To his opponent's charges on his record on education, Voinovich
is dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the only Republican in the United States who has
been endorsed by the Ohio Education Association and National
Education Association,'' he said, adding that Ms. Boyle was a
member of the state Legislature during the period cited in the
Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Boyle was vice chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
and a member of the Democratic leadership during those years,''
Voinovich said. ``They did nothing to fix the buildings, they did
nothing for technology and the urban school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boyle, who has not yet begun to run campaign commercials on
television, said her status as the underdog had ``allowed me to be
more focused, more intense.'' Pausing after a campaign fund-raising
breakfast with former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: ``This has been a marathon and
it's been pretty much uphill. But now, we're down to the last three
miles. It's a tough race.''

USC'S DAVIS LESS LARGE, IN CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ennis Davis almost didn't make it through his
first USC practice.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to remember it, although some wonder how that's
possible when he was near passing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, everyone knew I was out of shape,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   How could they forget? Davis was forced to the sideline, gasping
for air during one of his initial college workouts. That was two
years and 30 pounds ago, when Davis showed up fresh out of Reseda
High, a raw defensive tackle with too much baby fat but plenty of
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, I never worked out. I was just bigger than
everyone,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was so big that USC signed him to a letter of intent his
(begin ital)junior(end ital) season. That might sound illegal, but
Davis and his parents walked into coach John Robinson's office
during his junior year at Reseda and announced he wanted to sign
right there.
</P>
<P>
   If a recruit visits a school on his own, it is legal to sign the
player. And USC was willing to take a chance on the then-320-pound
version of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He's still big (6-foot-4, 289 pounds) today, just not as big as
he used to be. And he's USC's top defensive tackle, forced into a
primary role after senior Marc Matock broke his ankle against
Arizona State last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be the leader of our group,'' defensive line coach
Ed Orgeron said. ``As far as playmaking and toughness, he has to
make the plays that Matock did for us.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Davis will not be questioned about his
work ethic. Since the arrival of coach Paul Hackett, Davis has
worked as hard as any USC player to get into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was down as low as 270 pounds during the summer before
being told to gain back some weight to become an effective tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to name the top 10 workers, Ennis would be up
there,'' USC strength coach Matt Schiotz said. ``Everyone told me
he was 300-and-some pounds when I got here and he was a little
soft. I just talk to him a lot and he takes it and runs with it.
He's done everything I've asked. Ennis Davis is not lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis credits Schiotz for getting him into shape with a regimen
of wind sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's got me doing sprints. My legs are a lot stronger and
more explosive. We used to be a long distance running team last
year,'' Davis said. ``We could have outjogged anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone that knows Davis, the transformation has been vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Davis stopped by Reseda this week to visit his former coaches
and teachers. And as usual, he got to hear comments about his
trimmer, more muscular physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a picture of me that USC sent them, and they were
surprised how I looked,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Reseda coach Joel Schaeffer said Davis is merely continuing to
mature and improve, just as he did when he played for the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you see guys that develop too fast in high school,
and they don't have any room to grow,'' Schaeffer said. ``He was a
kid that was really starting to develop his senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer remembers Davis showing glimpses of his potential,
like the night he recorded 14 solo tackles against Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most amazing thing, 14 individual tackles as a down
lineman,'' Schaeffer said. ``That's one of the most outstanding
performances I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is also starting to see similar signs of improvement. Last
Saturday against Arizona State, Davis had six tackles, blocked a
field goal, forced a fumble and had two tackles for losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a few plays. I feel like I made an impact,'' Davis
said. ``I'm not surprised at all. I know I'm better than I've been
playing. I've really got to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron has been waiting for Davis to show he can be a
dominating player since last spring. He took Davis aside and told
him about other defensive linemen he coached that became stars
after dramatic weight losses, notably the University of Miami's
Cortez Kennedy and Russell Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a player to listen to you, you have to have a track record
of success. He's very similar to Kennedy in build,'' Orgeron said.
``He lost a lot of weight and he's listened. He's added a lot of
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't start as fast as I thought. He's finally coming
around to play defense the way I thought he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer is equally pleased that Davis has retained his loose,
upbeat nature in college. It's not unusual for Davis to break into
song while on the team bus, just to break the monotony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always singing and acting crazy,'' Davis said. ``Matock
and those other guys don't like me cutting loose.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a simple reason his singing is not popular with his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't sing. He's terrible,'' wide receiver Billy Miller
said.

CLEAR CHANNEL TO BUY JACOR FOR $2.8 BILLION IN STOCK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.Y., Minn., Ky.)  (jw) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clear Channel Communications agreed Thursday to pay $2.8 billion
in stock for Jacor Communications, the broadcaster that brings Rush
Limbaugh, Dr. Laura Schlessinger and other radio personalities to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would rank third in radio revenues, behind
CBS and the Chancellor Broadcasting Co., and second in number of
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Jacor's chairman is Sam Zell, a personality in his own right
whose Zell/Chilmark Fund holds 26 percent of the company's shares.
Analysts and others on Wall Street said that he had chosen Clear
Channel in part because its founder and chief executive, L. Lowry
Mays, had agreed to keep Jacor management and because he had
confidence in Clear Channel and its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone as savvy as Zell looks at someone as savvy as
Lowry Mays, I think he takes a lot of comfort from that,'' said
Thomas Vanderslice, a managing director in investment banking for
the CIBC Oppenheimer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Mays said in an interview that the deal, which also included the
assumption of $1.5 billion in Jacor's debt, would pay off through
growth rather than cutbacks and economies. Having clusters of radio
stations in many markets where he also has billboards, and programs
to send everywhere, will help in attracting advertisers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacor has about 40 percent of its radio station revenues in
cities where Clear Channel has forests of billboards. But the Clear
Channel radio stations are mostly in different markets, Mays said,
making it easy to win government approval for the deal without
having to sell many stations off.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have two or more radio stations in
six of the nation's 12 largest markets, but not New York City.
There, Clear Channel, the nation's largest billboard company, has
more than 1,000 billboards. In a rapidly consolidating business,
analysts praised the Jacor acquisition as complementary and fairly
priced. ``It's a very good fit,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch, confirming the company's prediction that
1999's earnings per share would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also agreed, however, that Jacor would have fetched
more before stock market reversals that had hit media companies
especially hard. In another rough day for the markets, Clear
Channel shares fell 37.5 cents, to $36.625, while Jacor rose 43.75
cents, to $40.5625. Standard &AMP; Poor's said it was considering
downgrading Clear Chanel's debt and upgrading Jacor's.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress eased the limits on radio station ownership,
buyers have built large companies able to offer advertisers the
sort of broad coverage, within a market or across the nation, that
newspapers and television have boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that CBS was the most serious rival Jacor bidder,
with Chancellor, controlled by the Hicks, Muse leveraged buyout
firm, also having shown an interest.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, has 625 radio stations, 19
television stations and about 220,000 billboards in 25 countries.
Mays founded the company with Red McCombs, a flamboyant San Antonio
car dealer who now owns the Minnesota Vikings, 26 years ago when
they bought a local FM station for $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mays is about as modest in discussing his company's performance
since then as Limbaugh is in discussing the virtues of his
political doctrines. ``A stellar growth performance history,'' Mays
said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Covington, Ky., Jacor, including pending acquisitions,
has 230 radio stations and one television station, as well as
Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates radio shows. Zell, said
to be out of the country, could not be reached for comment.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Working against deadlines imposed by New York's
financial markets, city and state officials are scrambling to
complete a series of complex deals that would create new
headquarters for the New York, American and Nasdaq Stock Exchanges
in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the deals could cost the city and state more
than $700 million, mainly in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The search for new homes for the financial industry has become a
high-stakes, real estate version of musical chairs, as the
exchanges _ which are also being wooed by New Jersey _ try to
extract subsidy packages and New York developers maneuver to get a
piece of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are optimistic that they can cobble together an
agreement to buy five parcels, diagonally across Broad Street from
the New York Stock Exchange, where a new trading floor and a
billion-dollar headquarters would be built. The outline of a deal
would need to be in place by the Nov. 4 board meeting of the
exchange, which has said it would consider a move to Battery Park
City or New Jersey if the city is unable to secure a location in
the financial district.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, city and state officials are trying to forge
an agreement this week with the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which owns Nasdaq and is acquiring the American Stock
Exchange, for a new headquarters for those exchanges on an empty
lot in Tribeca, in Battery Park City or at 42nd Street and the
Avenue of the Americas, near Times Square. The NASD, which met
Thursday in New York, is also considering two waterfront projects
in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a game of musical chairs,'' said Mary Ann Tighe,
executive managing director of the Insignia/Edward S. Gordon real
estate company, ``but now it looks like everybody is going to find
a place to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges are bargaining for a lot more than cuts in taxes.
The markets, particularly the New York Stock Exchange, are also
pushing the state and the city to provide cash to offset the cost
of constructing a modern trading operation.
</P>
<P>
   To clinch the deals, the city and state may have to provide $700
million in cash, tax breaks and low-cost electricity, an immense
sum but less than half the estimated cost to taxpayers of the
proposed baseball stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets, taken
together.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the city cannot afford to lose the New York Stock
Exchange, and that a deal with Nasdaq and the American Exchange
would be a coup for New York: moving the NASD headquarters and
several hundred employees from Washington to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the flight of the financial industry in New York, during
the last 15 years officials have granted nearly a billion dollars
in tax breaks and other incentives to investment banks and other
institutions. The financial industry accounts for only 5 percent of
the jobs in New York, but tax revenues linked to the industry
generated most of the city's $2.1 billion budget surplus last year.

SKIP AWAY DESERVES TO TAKE THE CAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Skip Away is not generally recognized as one of
the all-time great thoroughbreds, it can only be because his career
lacks a single, defining achievement, something like the
record-tying, 16-race winning streak that made Cigar a household
name.
</P>
<P>
   Something like the record Skip Away is about to set.
</P>
<P>
   Should Skip Away, ridden by Jerry Bailey, defeat Gentlemen and
four others in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park
in New York on Saturday, he would win $600,000 for owner Carolyn
Hine and become the first horse to crack $10 million in career
earnings. His new total, $10,106,360, would break the record of
$9,999,815 set by Cigar in 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he runs as good as he looks,'' trainer Sonny Hine said this
week, ``he'll be awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Should he lose, he would get one more chance at the record, in
the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic Nov.7 at Churchill Downs,
before his scheduled retirement to stud.
</P>
<P>
   Losing is a possibility, even though the 5-year-old has won nine
races in a row and is a 2-5 favorite for the 1\-mile race in which
each horse will carry 126 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen's trainer, Richard Mandella, is pulling out all the
stops to get the 6-year-old back to the 1997 form that was good
enough to beat Skip Away in the Pimlico Special. Mandella fitted
Gentlemen with blinkers for the first time Monday at Belmont and
the result was a best-of-the-morning 58 3/5-second clocking for a
5-furlong workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just desperate to get him one notch closer to that
('97 form) rather than admit he's just not as good this year,''
Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen will be ridden by Corey Nakatani. The rest of the
field: Running Stag, ridden by Ray Cochrane; Fire King, Frank
Lovato Jr.; Wagon Limit, Robbie Davis; and Pacificbounty, Gary
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup is one of five preps Saturday at Belmont for the
Nov.7 Breeders' Cup races at Churchill Downs. Nakatani will ride
Sharp Cat in the Beldame and Lazy Lode in the Turf Clasic for
trainer Wally Dollase. Gary Stevens will ride Dushyantor in the
Turf Classic for Bobby Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   A Gold Cup upset by Gentlemen would be poetic. It was Mandella's
Dare and Go who beat Cigar when he went for a 17th straight victory
_ to break Citation's modern record for consecutive wins _ in the
'96 Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does it this weekend,'' Mandella said of Skip Away,
``he'll have earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, high earnings are all relative, dependent on
longevity and timing as much as on greatness. Of North America's
top 12 career money-winners, 11 raced in the past 10 years,
enjoying the full effects of purse inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is John Henry, whose $6,597,947, earned in
1977-84, once was twice as much as any other horse's bankroll and
is now fourth on the list. John Henry would be the all-time
earnings champion if we adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be good to see Skip Away break eight figures. He
doesn't need the money, but he needs the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Bob Baffert-trained Excellent Meeting, the easy Del
Mar Debutante winner, looks like a ``single'' for bettors in the
Oak Leaf Stakes for 2-year-old fillies, part of the $2
million-guaranteed pick-six at Santa Anita on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Director of racing Tom Robbins said the Oak Leaf wasn't put
earlier in the card, making room for a more competitive race in the
pick-six sequence, because of its stature as a Grade I race.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Del Mar Futurity runner-up Daring General heads the
Norfolk for 2-year-olds, and 3-year-old Magical Allure faces older
fillies and mares in the Lady's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Add guarantees: A $5 million pick-six guarantee is planned for
the Breeders' Cup, covering every race except the Juvenile. It's an
attempt to reverse the trend that has seen bets nationwide on the
Breeders' Cup pick-six decline steadily since it debuted as a
pick-seven with more than $8.5 million wagered in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This year's will be advertised as the ``Ultra Pick 6.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand old man: Everett Nevin, a California racing fixture who
was still serving as director of racing at Ferndale this summer at
age 92, died Thursday in Napa, Calif. He'd suffered a stroke a few
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin's son, Dennis, is a California steward.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery deepens: Worldly Manner, the Del Mar Futurity winner
purchased from John and Betty Mabee by a still-anonymous buyer, was
shipped from Bob Baffert's barn at Santa Anita to Niall
O'Callaghan's at Churchill Downs over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the Racing Form reported, the 2-year-old was vanned
out of the Churchill barns Tuesday, passing the gates under an
assumed name. His destination not announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Form quoted a source revealing only that Worldly Manner
might not run in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and would approach the
May 1 Kentucky Derby in ``a way you wouldn't consider
traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   New look: The biggest changes in the Daily Racing Form under new
editor and publisher Steve Crist will be in evidence in Saturday's
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new features: a national statistics page, 12
past-performance lines instead of 10 for horses at major tracks,
and, coming later, yearling auction prices for 2- and 3-year-olds. &QL;

RENO SAYS SHE'LL LOOK AT THE ORIGNS OF STARR'S LEWINSKY INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that she
would review accusations by President Clinton's lawyer that Kenneth
Starr might have misled the Justice Department in January when he
sought permission to begin an investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyer, David Kendall, wrote to Reno on Monday to
say that news accounts and information released by the House
Judiciary Committee suggested that Linda Tripp had manipulated
events to allow Starr, the independent counsel, to assume legal
jurisdiction over the case and that Mrs. Tripp in turn might have
been prompted by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   When the Justice Department allowed Starr last winter to
investigate the Lewinsky matter, it did so primarily on the basis
of evidence indicating that a job offer Ms. Lewinsky had received
might have been in exchange for her silence, as a witness in the
Paula Jones civil case, about her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The job offer, from Revlon, had been extended through the help
of Clinton's close friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Reno, Kendall wrote, ``Recently released
material by the House Judiciary Committee demonstrates that it was
almost certainly Ms. Tripp who first encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to
seek Jordan's assistance, and that it was Ms. Tripp and only Ms.
Tripp who suggested a job-for-affidavit quid pro quo (which Ms.
Lewinsky testified she declined to seek).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Kendall wrote, ``major news organizations have
suggested that Ms. Tripp's encouragement of these acts may have
resulted from prompting by Office of Independent Counsel staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter noted that although Starr had told Congress that he
had learned of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair from Mrs. Tripp herself,
recent news reports said his office had received word of it from a
lawyer sympathetic to Paula Jones at least a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall asked Reno to disclose all the materials that Starr
presented to her and her aides in January.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Starr's office said in a statement that his
prosecutors had been ``professional, responsible and forthright''
in their dealings with the Justice Department. The statement said
Kendall's letter was ``notable for its lengthy attacks on the
conduct of persons outside the Office of Independent Counsel and
the absence of any connection between those actions and those of
members of this office, other than innuendo and guilt by
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said at her weekly news conference Thursday that she was
looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing Kendall's letter to see what would be
appropriate action, if any, to take,'' she said. ``With respect to
what I can comment on, I can tell you that I'm conducting a review.
I can't comment on the nature of the review.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that in considering the matter, the Justice Department
would look at the thousands of pages of documents from the
independent counsel that have recently been released by the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Reno's review did not
constitute a formal inquiry.

MEDIA COMPANY SPONSORS AT AN ADVERTISING CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the golden age of radio and the early days of
television, when dulcet-voiced announcers like Don Wilson, Harry
Von Zell and Ed Herlihy let listeners and viewers know that
programs were being ``brought to you by'' sponsors like Lucky
Strike cigarettes, Carnation milk and Kraft cheese?
</P>
<P>
   If only those smooth-talking pitchmen could be on hand for the
89th annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers,
to let attendees know that programs will be brought to them by
sponsors like ESPN, Time Inc. and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies are paying an estimated $100,000 to sponsor each
of the three daily general sessions of the conference, which began
Thursday afternoon at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Naples, Fla. For
that fee, the sponsors are paying their way onto the conference
programs by staging presentations at the general sessions starting
Friday morning; they also receive flattering write-ups in the
conference newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the association has sold participation
in the conference that goes well beyond such typical support as
media companies' paying for receptions and meals. It marks a
reversal of the traditional pattern of marketers' having to pay the
media for commercial time and advertising space.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the association first expanded media sponsorship
availabilities, some attendees grumbled that the general sessions _
paid for by ABC, CBS and Fox _ amounted to little more than the
conference equivalent of TV infomercials or print advertorials.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in an interview with the trade publication
Advertising Age, Cathleen P. Black, president of the magazine
division of the Hearst Corp. in New York, said, ``If you look at
the program, no one would imagine that print exists.''
</P>
<P>
   So of course eyebrows rose when Ms. Black agreed to sponsor a
general session at the 1998 conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't fight 'em, join 'em,'' Ms. Black said in an
interview this week before the conference began.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national convention should probably not be bought out by
sponsors,'' she added, ``and ideally ought to be a neutral forum
for thinking about where the business is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black said that she ``would not be in support'' of her trade
association, the Magazine Publishers of America, selling sponsored
sessions at its conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the ANA has taken a particular direction, and John feels
very committed to it,'' she added. ``So I'm delighted to have an
opportunity to talk about the importance and effectiveness of
print.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reference was to John J. Sarsen Jr., president and chief
executive of the association, which is based in New York. He has
staunchly defended the idea of sponsored sessions and was
instrumental in bringing them back for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had nothing but positive responses to the format we
established last year,'' Sarsen said, ``and the attendance this
time looks like another all-time record high'' at about 550
registrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conferences are very difficult and expensive to put
together,'' he added. ``The sponsorship fees enable us to produce a
meeting of the proper caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we're talking about'' at the conference ``is
totally consistent with a marketer trying to build business by
building brands,'' Sarsen said, ``and reaching the changing
consumer.'' His reference was to the theme of the conference, which
is ``Brand Champions: Connecting With the New Consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, compared with 1997, when all sponsors were broadcast
television networks, ``we tried to be more inclusive'' this year,
Sarsen said, ``with an array of sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Black arranged for Hearst to share its sponsorship with
other magazine publishers, she said, so attendees would hear ``a
subtle pitch'' rather than a hard sell. The Hearst general session
Saturday morning will include representatives from the Reader's
Digest Association and the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to get in front of a very prestigious
group of our very best customers and present to them,'' said David
Long, president for media sales and marketing at Time Inc. in New
York. ``The paying aspect is somewhat irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The other sponsors are USA Today, published by the Gannett Co.,
and ESPN, the cable sports television network owned by the Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously as cost conscious as anybody,'' said George
Bodenheimer, executive vice president for sales and marketing at
ESPN in New York, ``so you have to look at something like this on a
case-by-base basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got a terrific brand story to tell,'' he added,
``focusing on how we created our brand, developed a distinct brand
image and extended it to the Internet, radio and a magazine. That's
very in keeping with the theme of the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors of Advertising Age, who in editorials and columns have
been the most outspoken critics of the sponsorship idea, continue
to decry the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically selling out,'' said Scott Donaton, the New
York-based editor of Advertising Age, a Crain Communications
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think the media have a branding story to tell,'' he
added, ``have them on a panel.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion was echoed by the head of the counterpart of the
advertiser association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problems with the media sponsoring our cocktail
receptions and events like that,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president
and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies in New York. ``But in our view, the programming should be
the programming.''
</P>
<P>
   The general sessions of the conference, which ends on Sunday
night, will also feature speakers from companies that are not
buying sponsorships. Among them are Denis F. Beausejour, vice
president for advertising at the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.; Robert A.
Eckert, president and chief executive at the Kraft Foods unit of
the Philip Morris Companies; Robert W. Pittman, president and chief
operating officer at America Online Inc., and Raymond W. Smith,
chairman of the Bell Atlantic Corp.

JOVIAL JOE DIVERSIFIES _ SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The reality is that, for better or worse,
journalist Joe McDonnell has re-invented himself. From now on, the
AM-1150 all-sports radio afternoon drive-time host is the jovial,
jocular jokemeister Joe McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   Try to contain your laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Once convinced that breaking stories and giving listeners the
inside dope on local teams was the best way for him to succeed in
this medium, McDonnell now says the way to survive in today's radio
climate is to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   So in the last five months, hard-hitting news hasn't been
completely replaced by sophomoric pranks. It just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I've taken so much criticism in the last five
months,'' said McDonnell. ``But at the same time, I'm getting three
times more positive response. I disagree that it's
lowest-common-denominator radio. I think we're getting the more
intelligent listener now because we're going after a broader
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for McDonnell's show, and for the station, have finally
started to materialize, although new station program director Mike
Thompson points out they still rank 23rd in the city with the men's
25-to-54 audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's Thompson's feeling that McDonnell's adjustment is ``nothing
more than coming back to being himself. Joe can go either way with
breaking stories and having fun. Why can't he also do both?''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Thompson: ``I don't ever want to hear a talk-show host call
himself a journalist. Red Smith was a journalist. We have knowledge
and opinions and we try to figure out what the listeners want to
hear. It's not about callers and guests. It's the host interacting
with the listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   A trend continues in sports-talk radio across the country to
skew programming more toward ``guy-talk radio'' _ more locker room
humor (even if it's female bashing), more goofs, contrived
controversy and, in a sense, appealing to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, all-sports WIP has succeeded with a
``guy-talk'' approach that was featured in a recent segment of
HBO's ``Real Sports.'' The premise was that sports seemed less
frequently discussed than other risque subjects that guys may talk
about over a beer.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, the all-sports station where Thompson worked before
coming to L.A. was known as ``The Ticket.'' A local media columnist
referred to it as ``The Schicticket.''
</P>
<P>
   And going back to the sports-talk genesis in L.A., the demise of
then-KMPC came for a variety of reasons, but one of them was not
attracting enough listeners with more news-topic-minded hosts like
McDonnell, Jim Lampley and Fred Wallin.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe breaking stories and pounding Del Harris into the ground
was more noble, but for McDonnell, it attracted only a small but
loyal core audience. McDonnell thinks that element, which is how
XTRA-AM (690) drive-time host Lee Hamilton (not his real name)
survives, can be incorporated within his drive-time afternoon show,
but not be the focal point.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the humor portion of this story.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, McDonnell played a tape of an Adolf Hitler
speech, in German, that he introduced as Bobby Hull's response to a
story that he made pro-Nazi remarks recently during a tour of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, McDonnell staged an interview with someone
claiming to be a former employee of Fox's Rupert Murdoch, who owns
the Dodgers. The ``guest'' claimed, among other outrageous things,
that Hideo Nomo had been traded because he refused to learn
English.
</P>
<P>
   Stop, my sides are splitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mistake in judgment on my part,'' admits McDonnell
of the latter after receiving an immediate negative response from
the Dodgers, who changed to AM-1150 for game coverage last season.
``But in my opinion, it was harmless. It was funny for those who
got it. I think it speaks more about how our society in general is
too sensitive about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the bottom line is sports-talk has slid back three rungs
on the evolution chart because craziness has overtaken credibility
_ leaving the befuddled listener to determine what's real and what
isn't _ McDonnell doesn't consider this selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have enough credibility to last a lifetime,'' said
McDonnell, 42, who recently became more lean and less mean by
losing 200 pounds. ``But really, this is just full-circle for me. I
was doing this nine years ago at KFI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is not to break stories but to keep people informed
and entertained. We're not KNX or KFWB. Journalism looks great on
the mantle, but it doesn't get you anywhere in ratings. And that's
the name of the game.'' &QL; 
A HIT TOO CLOSE TO HOME
</P>
<P>
   One of the perks Cammi Granato has as the Kings' new radio
analyst is semi-frequent reunions with her older brother, Tony, the
former Kings right wing who plays for the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Kings faced the Sharks in an exhibition game last
Saturday in West Valley City, Utah, Cammi Granato, working just her
seventh game in on-the-job training, found out in a scary moment
what it's like when you just can't talk.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes into the third period, Tony crumbled to the ice
when he was hit just below the left cheekbone by a deflected puck
in front of the net. He missed 19 games last season with a broken
jaw on a similar play and is also continuing a comeback from a
brain tumor. When he immediately went to the locker room, it took
everything for Cammi not to pull off her headset and run down to
her brother's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony doesn't fall to the ice easily, so when I saw that my
heart dropped,'' said Cammi. ``The play went into the corner, so
(play-by-play man) Nick Nickson didn't see it right away. It was
very hard to refocus on the game. Right away, I at least wanted to
call down to the locker room to see how he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony took four stitches and came back five minutes later. The
puck caught him flat and missed his jawbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to stay in the locker room and change, but he
told me later he came back out because he knew that would make me
feel better,'' Cammi said.
</P>
<P>
   Cammi Granato makes her regular-season broadcasting debut when
the Kings open in Edmonton on Saturday night. In addition to
KRLA-AM (1110), the Kings radio network includes KHJJ-AM (1380) in
Palmdale/Lancaster, KBET-AM (1220) in Santa Clarita and KTRO-AM
(1520) in Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' 7 p.m. opener is part of a rare NHL TV doubleheader
by KCAL-Channel 9, which will also do the Ducks' opener in
Washington at 4 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
Fox taking the ``Catcher Cam'' to new heights during these baseball
playoffs. There's nothing more dramatic than having a catcher keep
the contraption on as he's taking a throw from the outfield and
tagging a runner at the plate (check the Cleveland-Boston series).
So far, San Diego's Carlos Hernandez has worn it in the NLCS.
Here's hoping Atlanta's Javy Lopez does the same. Thanks again to
the guys at Burbank's Areal-Video Systems. &QL; 
Fox Sports News' hiring of Rex ``The Wonder Scoop'' Hudler for
postseason coverage. &QL; 
David Letterman's Top 10 list of NBA player demands includes: No.
7. For the love of God, no more Shaquille O'Neal albums. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
NBC's think-tank tandem of Bob Costas and Joe Morgan, who are about
as relaxing and endearing on the ALCS games as the network's promos
for ``Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.'' Case in point: Game 2 is
tied 1-1 in the bottom of the eighth, Derek Jeter at the plate, and
Costas is debating Morgan about the definition of a baseball purist
vs. a baseball traditionalist. Smart-talk is great _ once in
awhile. But for these two cerebral giants, it's like listening to
``Point-Counterpoint'' on everything, with Costas all but bursting
out with: ``Joe, you ignorant second baseman...'' As much as Bob
Uecker was criticized last year for breaking in with inane
comments, we now appreciate the levity he once brought to the
telecast.

FIRST MEETING OF UNION AND NBA GETS THEM NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first substantive talks in more than two months between
opposing sides of the National Basketball Association's labor
dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a five-hour meeting that was described as cordial by the
league and ``almost like two bulls letting off a little steam'' by
the players association produced another scheduled round of talks
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a major compromise, that will not be enough time to
preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing its first
regular-season games to labor strife in November.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said the league
would wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to
cancel regular-season games. He also discussed the possibility of a
significantly shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made a determination that you need this exact
number of games in order to have a representative season,'' Granik
said. ``But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can't
possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there
yet. We have a few months before we have to face that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only progress involved Thursday in the conference
room of a midtown Manhattan hotel was a question-and-answer session
over the league's latest proposal to the players.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the union president, and vice presidents Herb
Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting with the union's
executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyers. No owners were
present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern and the league's
lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies of a
two-week-old proposal to the players.
</P>
<P>
   At one point before the two parties broke for lunch, Stern and
Hunter raised their voices and accused each other of handling their
constituencies poorly, a participant in the meeting said. But the
two were seen shaking hands and laughing after the meeting
concluded shortly after 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some venting from both sides,'' Hunter said. ``We've
been placid and very respectful. Today, we took the coats off and
we were inclined to take the gloves off a little bit. Having done
that, I think it kind of loosened up both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter added: ``Did anybody blink today? They're sort of look at
us for any kind of nuance they can find during the course of
negotiations that might, in some way or another, give some
indication that while we're mouthing one thing we might be open to
something else. We're looking at their body language, too. I don't
think that they're ready to make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The last formal meeting between both sides on Aug. 6 ended when
Stern and the owners abruptly marched out after they had received a
proposal from the players.

 AN OPTIMISTIC DOCTORS' REPORT ON STRAWBERRY  (jw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All but one of 36 lymph nodes taken from Darryl
Strawberry were free of cancer, his doctors at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan reported
Thursday, and they said the Yankee outfielder could be released
from the hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through the hospital, doctors presented
an optimistic report on his condition and predicted he would ``make
a complete recovery and return to full activities including playing
major league baseball next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon cancer was diagnosed for Strawberry, 36, on Oct. 1, and he
had surgery two days later to remove a tumor and a 16-inch portion
of his large intestine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statement, one lymph node contained evidence of
tumor. The margins of the colon, doctors said, were free of
disease. They said Strawberry would require a ``course of adjuvant
chemotherapy,'' meaning he would be administered drugs to help
prevent a recurrence of the cancer. There was no mention whether he
would need radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through the team, Strawberry said: ``I
am really feeling stronger every day, and I'm truly grateful to all
of my doctors. They feel very good about everything and are
confident this will be a successful process. When you are in a
situation like this, you put yourself in your doctors' hands. I
share their confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the Yankees' pitcher and a longtime teammate of
Strawberry with the Mets and Yankees, said: ``It looks good. We all
anticipated some chemo _ to what extent, we didn't know. It seems
like good news right now.''

GERMAN GREEN EVOLVES FROM REVOLUTIONARY TO PRAGMATIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-ALBRIGHT, KOSOVO-REFUGEES) 
(js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ It is some distance from the leftist revolutionary
struggles of Frankfurt in the 1970s to the corridors of power in
Washington, but Joschka Fischer of Germany completes that long
march on Friday, with unpredictable consequences for the Atlantic
alliance and for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a leader of the environmentalist Green Party, is to
hold talks with President Clinton as part of a German delegation
led by Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder. His presence suggests
that he will emerge as foreign minister in the coalition government
of Social Democrats and Greens now being formed.
</P>
<P>
   Self-educated, irreverent, a former worker in an Opel auto plant
and once a member of the Revolutionary Struggle movement in
Germany, Fischer personifies the emergence of a post-Cold War
generation of German politicians. The question is: Will the
German-U.S. bonds that the Cold War forged prove impervious to this
change?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, of course, would have come this far without a fair dose
of intelligent pragmatism, and Fischer, 50, has already said
continuity will be central to German foreign policy under any
``Red-Green'' coalition. His enduring contempt for neckties is
balanced by a growing respect for NATO. ``No adventures'' has
become a maxim.
</P>
<P>
   But even for a man who has moved from a long-held pacifism to
the belief that force has its place in diplomacy _ a conversion
painfully completed by the Bosnian war _ Clinton's support for
military action against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo Province poses an
acute and unwanted quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer is unconvinced that NATO has a mandate to act in Kosovo,
officials close to him said. Even if this hesitation _ largely
shared by Schroeder _ is overcome under Clinton's suasion, it
underscores the new challenges facing America with a Germany more
ready to think independently about its world role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fischer believes strongly in Germany's anchoring in the
alliance, but also in reinforcing the role of the United Nations,''
said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the 1968 student movement in
Paris and longtime friend of Fischer's. ``He is very unhappy about
the idea of using force in Kosovo without a specific Security
Council mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer declined to be interviewed. But Cohn-Bendit, a Green
member of the European Parliament who has spoken regularly to the
Green leaders in recent days, said the party saw a danger that a
NATO air strike in Kosovo opposed by Russia and unbacked by an
explicit Security Council resolution would provoke a treacherous
``regionalization'' of world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would say to the Russians and Chinese, we do what we want
on our side, and you do what you want on your sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, takes the view that a U.N.
resolution passed last month calling on Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, to withdraw special police and army units from
Kosovo is sufficient legal basis for the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see any need for additional resolutions,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday. That message,
officials said, will be conveyed to Schroeder and Fischer in
Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fischer's life _ as well as the Greens' thirst to
taste power for the first time two decades after their founding _
suggests that he will be amenable to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have balanced on the edge of an abyss, but I was
always able to see the reality that the abyss was there,'' Fischer
once said. ``And I always managed to step back in time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The son of a butcher, Fischer did not complete high school and
married for the first time while still in his teens; he has been
married three times, one less than Schroeder. By the early 1970s,
he was living in a commune in Frankfurt, reading German
philosophers voraciously and working with other members of
Revolutionary Struggle toward a vision of a libertarian and
egalitarian society
</P>
<P>
   Violence was not part of the movement's arsenal. But on one
occasion, after the revolutionary leftist leader Ulrike Meinhof
committed suicide in prison in 1976, street protests in Frankfurt
became uncontrollable, and a policeman was severely burned. Fischer
and 13 other members of his movement were arrested and held for 36
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the author Christian Schmidt, who has written a
book about Fischer, that experience marked a turning point. Fischer
had been incensed by Ms. Meinhof's death, describing it as ``an
annihilation in the truest sense of the word,'' but he now turned
away from extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the incident, he spoke of how the best ideals
and intentions could be ``turned upside down into crime'' if they
proved unattainable, and urged a course of moderation and
nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the start of the long march away from militancy,''
Schmidt said. ``He now represents a whole general generation of
Germans who were students with revolutionary thoughts and have
become dentists and lawyers. At root, he is a highly gifted
opportunist who has come to believe in the virtues of
reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer joined the Greens in 1982, convinced that they were the
only political force capable of bringing real change to Germany.
The experience of power _ he was environment minister in the state
of Hesse _ completed his conversion to the merits of compromise. In
recent years, he has persistently stood against the so-called
``fundamentalist'' wing of the party that is still committed to its
pacifist roots.
</P>
<P>
   But even the many U.S. officials who are convinced that Fischer
will, in the end, prove supportive on Kosovo and other issues worry
about the party behind him. ``Can he deliver the Greens?'' an
official said. ``That is what we need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The party is to meet on Oct. 23 to approve any coalition
agreement, and some party members have already warned that an
attack on Kosovo without an explicit U.N. mandate would be a
serious obstacle to their support.

KNOBLAUCH OWNS UP TO MAKING A MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ After a nearly sleepless night that included
watching replays of himself ignoring a baseball just a few feet
away from him, Chuck Knoblauch acknowledged Thursday what thousands
of others had seen at Yankee Stadium and on television: that he
made a mistake in not retrieving the ball on the play that led to a
Yankee playoff loss Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up,'' said Knoblauch, the first of eight times he
used that phrase in an interview. ``I screwed up the play, and I
feel terrible about that. I should have went and gotten the ball,
regardless of what the outcome of the umpire's call was.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I need to apologize to my teammates and my manager
and all the Yankees fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's lapse came against the Cleveland Indians in the 12th
inning of Game 2 of the American League Championship Series. With
the score tied at 1-1, Cleveland's Travis Fryman put down a
sacrifice bunt, and as he sprinted toward first base, the throw
from Tino Martinez hit Fryman in the back and rolled behind
Knoblauch, who was covering first. As Knoblauch stood screaming at
the umpires, pleading for an interference call, Enrique Wilson, who
had been on first base, kept running and scored the go-ahead run.
An interference call would have meant Fryman was out and Wilson
would have had to return to first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won, 4-1, to tie the four-of-seven-game series at
1-1, with Game 3 to be played in Cleveland on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were other reasons the Yankees lost, including missed
opportunities with runners in scoring position, and even another
culprit on the play, because Martinez made an errant throw into
Fryman's back. But Knoblauch's lapse was the flashpoint, made him
an instant goat with fans and the topic of conversation in the
baseball world and around New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters at Jacobs Field on Thursday,
Knoblauch said everything seemed to happen so quickly when he was
in the middle of the play. He was convinced that Fryman, who ran on
the grass infield as he headed to first, had violated the rule
requiring runners to stay in the basepath, and Knoblauch said he
lost track of time as he argued the call.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Yankees arrived here late Wednesday, he turned on
the television in his hotel room and saw over and over _ at regular
speed and in slow motion _ the misplay that made him famous.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``almost like times stands still,'' he acknowledged
Thursday, saying repeatedly that he had blown the play.
</P>
<P>
   This admission was a reversal of his comments immediately after
the game, when he stood at his Yankee Stadium locker and told
reporters that he just did not see the ball, that he would not have
done anything differently and that there was no reason to feel
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Knoblauch believed he had not done anything wrong, he
began to understand that all others who saw the play felt
differently. The Yankee Stadium crowd booed him heavily when he
batted in the bottom of the 12th, and the media horde around his
locker after the game peppered him with questions about the play.
Other Yankees began consoling him in an understated manner, as they
would for any teammate making an error in a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a moment like that, you need some support sometimes and it
was nice to have guys come up and have Mr. Steinbrenner come up and
talk to me,'' said Knoblauch, referring to the team owner George
Steinbrenner, ``and basically tell me to keep my chin up.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch talked about the play with others on the flight to
Cleveland, including the team counselor, Fran Pirozzolo. At about
noon Thursday, Knoblauch bumped into Yankees media relations
director Rick Cerrone and asked if he could speak to reporters
before Thursday afternoon's workout, arranging his mea culpa.
Knoblauch then spoke at length with Yankees manager Joe Torre
before marching into a packed interview room.
</P>
<P>
   A runner scoring from first base, Knoblauch said, ``should never
happen on a play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the fans who booed him? ``From their perspective,
they were booing me screwing up the play,'' Knoblauch said, ``and
you can't fault them for that. They're going to react to what they
see.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The play comes near the end of what has been a difficult season
for Knoblauch, professionally and personally. Acquired in a trade
with Minnesota in mid-February and immediately hailed as the
Yankees' best lead-off hitter since Rickey Henderson in the 1980s,
Knoblauch fell into a chronic problem making short throws in spring
training, and through the early part of the season, his batting
average hovered around .250. Knoblauch solved his throwing troubles
in July and had a binge of home runs _ he finished with a
career-high 17 _ but the newfound power began working against him.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's level swing turned into an uppercut and his batting
average plunged. His defense improved markedly in the last six
weeks of the regular season, and he began spraying line drives in
the final 15 days to finish with a .265 average.
</P>
<P>
   All year, Knoblauch has coped with the progressive illness of
his father, Ray, who has an aggressive form of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch stood alone at his locker in Cleveland after
Thursday's workout, thinking more about the play. ``You wish things
like that wouldn't happen,'' he said, ``but somewhere, there's
reasons for everything happening. My intentions were not to let the
ball sit there and let the guy score and cost us the game. That's
not what I'm all about. You think about it, and you come to the
reality that you can't change anything and that you made a mistake
and you screwed up, and try to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, Paul O'Neill and Chili Davis all said they felt
Knoblauch was strong enough to get through his adversity. Said
Cone: ``I was really happy to see him be a stand-up guy about it.
It was the right thing to do. He can come out and have a good night
tomorrow night and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   A reflective Torre said he thought about Chicago Cubs outfielder
Brant Brown, who dropped a fly ball in the last week of the season
and cost the Cubs a game. When Chicago clinched the National
League's wild-card berth by winning a playoff game, Torre said, he
was happy that Brown would not have to live with knowledge that his
mistake had been pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of Torre's own players is in a similar situation.
Should the Yankees lose this series and end their remarkable
season, Knoblauch's lapse will likely be viewed as the turning
point, rightly or wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want somebody labeled like that,'' Torre said. ``I'd
like to win for reasons other than that, but that would be a great
eraser for this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more Yankees victories in this series may be the only way
Knoblauch won't be remembered for his blunder.

BANK OF ENGLAND LOWERS RATE A QUARTER-POINT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by
one-quarter of a percentage point Thursday, reflecting concern
about global financial turmoil and fears of recession among British
exporters and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the bank's first such action since June 1996. The general
response to the reduction, to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent,
however, was that it would make little immediate difference to
Britain's economic slowdown. ``What makes a difference is the
signal that rates are coming down,'' said Holger Schmieding, an
economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``It was important in that those
expectations were not disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduction had little effect on currency trading and did
nothing to halt the slide of British equity markets. London's
Financial Times 100 index slumped 2.7 percent Thursday, to 4,698.90
points.
</P>
<P>
   The British rate cut matched a similar quarter-point reduction
by the Federal Reserve in the United States last week and coincided
with indications that interest rates internationally are falling.
Japan, Canada and Spain have also cut rates; Portugal and Ireland
are expected to drop their higher rates to the average among the
nine other nations preparing to introduce the single European
currency on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee _
which is responsible for setting interest rates _ said it had taken
the action because the worsening international climate had damaged
business and consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's guidelines are primarily to hold down inflation to a
target of 2.5 percent. Despite indications this week that British
paychecks are soaring, the bank said Thursday that inflation might
fall to less than 2.5 percent, making it ``appropriate'' to cut
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The modest reduction disappointed some analysts who had been
hoping for a reduction of half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a move in the right direction, and it's
obviously part of what's necessary,'' said David Mackie, an
economist at J.P. Morgan. ``But the Bank of England has a lot more
to do. The economy is going to be very weak next year, and they'll
need to react to that by cutting rates aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rate cut came after projections by Gordon Brown, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, that growth would be far slower next
year than the government had first forecast _ possibly as low as 1
percent.

PATIENCE PAYS OFF, YET AGAIN, FOR INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, N.Y.) (jw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There is a mellow streak in the Cleveland Indians.
The Indians are so laid back and patient they will wait for
anything: paint to dry, a pot to boil or a crack to develop in a
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   A fissure developed in the mighty Yankees and flaws were exposed
on Wednesday night during Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series. No matter how unsinkable the Yankees looked in
Game 1, the Indians remained unfazed and were confident that an
iceberg lurked around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch proved that. A ball sat on the dirt behind first
base in the 12th inning while Knoblauch argued with the umpire, and
Enrique Wilson kept running. Wilson scored the deciding run in the
Indians' 4-1 victory. At the end, the controversy became the focus
of the Yankees' loss. In fact, the sage Indians outsmarted and
outplayed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the little things,'' shortstop Omar Vizquel said
Thursday as the Indians prepared for Friday night's Game 3 with a
workout at Jacobs Field. ``It's hard to do the little things when
you have smart people like they have doing it the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were they thinking? They had Tim Raines bunting, and he
couldn't bunt. They had Shane Spencer hitting with nobody out and
he couldn't do his job. A stupid bunt meant three runs for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman put down the fundamental bunt that started the
bizarre ending and began the lambasting of Knoblauch. A day later,
the Indians were only happy to revel in the misery of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were getting on Knoblauch, that can create
dissension within their team,'' reliever Paul Shuey said. ``It
can't be good for that team. But it's good for us. We'll take what
we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience is the Indians' virtue. That's why their collapse in
Game 1 at the feet of the Yankees, allowing five first-inning runs
in a 7-2 loss, rolled right off their backs. Far be it from the
Indians to panic. In their last eight playoff series _ dating to
1995 _ they have lost every Game 1. Four times they have come back
to win the series. They have a fifth opportunity in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a veteran team and we know each other,'' first baseman
Jim Thome said. ``We shrug off bad days and have confidence that
we're good enough to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   A team less self-assured _ and the Yankees have left many
opponents searching for self-esteem this season _ might have been
shaken by the dominance the Yankees displayed in Game 1. But the
Indians have been around too long to be daunted. There is a core to
this team, including Vizquel, Thome, Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar,
Manny Ramirez and Charles Nagy, that remembers the resilience they
showed in making it to the 1995 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to play, and you're afraid of a team, you're never
going to beat them,'' Alomar said. ``You have to say, `You're here
and you might as well show them you can play, too.' You can't fear
anybody. If you lose a Game 1, it's out the window. Forget it. This
is baseball. It's not predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would have predicted a series dead even after two games. A
split in Yankee Stadium? It seemed improbable. At least in the
afterglow of the Yankees' breakdown in Game 2, some of the Indians
were chiding those who felt the men in the celebrated pinstripes
were flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants the Yankees to win,'' Vizquel said. ``It
doesn't matter whether it's ESPN, CNN or the FBI; everyone wants to
see the Yankees win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought the Yankees were unbeatable. We know we have
guys who can do it under pressure, like the veterans you see around
our clubhouse. We've been in situations before when it looked like
we didn't have a chance. If the pitchers can keep us in the game _
like they did last night _ we always have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven Indians pitchers, from Nagy to closer Mike Jackson, held
the robust offense of the Yankees to just seven hits over 12
innings. One run, that's all they could muster. And yet, the
Indians heard little, if any, credit offered to them for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interview room yesterday, all they talked about was the
call and the umpire,'' Vizquel said Thursday, referring to the
Yankees' post-game comments. ``They did not talk about them
anticipating the bunt by Fryman. They did not talk about driving in
a run when they needed to. They did not say any of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably because they cannot take losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians can take it, but then they discard it like a paper
wad. That is the nature of a mellow team that perseveres with
uncommon patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the little things,'' Vizquel said. ``We do the
fundamentals. We were working on bunt plays after the playoffs
started. We were like, `What on earth are we doing this for?' But
just wait, and it pays off.''

ANALYSIS: GUESSING AT CLINTON'S FATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk of duty and Constitution, it was
not all that difficult for the House to open a formal impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton Thursday. The more troublesome
question is how Congress will bring to a conclusion the process
that Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called ``this venture, this
excursion, this journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom, which Democrats have clung to across
these tumultuous weeks for their party, is that the less impulsive
Senate will never accumulate the votes to convict Clinton, and that
inescapable fact will finally force some kind of a deal between the
president and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to remain in office,'' pronounced Rep.
James Moran, D-Va. ``That's a foregone conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   But conventional wisdom has often been wrong in this strange
political year dominated by Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, and intense causes sometimes take on a life and momentum
of their own on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Many House members _ including some Republicans _ fear that
having opened Pandora's box Thursday, they will never get it closed
again without first moving through impeachment of the president and
a Senate trial that could consume Congress for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's out of control,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn. ``Everything's set in motion, and I don't know how
you put it back in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   This sense of riding a runaway train could diminish if after
months of deliberations and gathering evidence, the Congress and
the country jointly come to a national conclusion that Clinton
should be impeached, tried and removed from office, like the
consensus that Richard Nixon faced when he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that Congress could rush ahead without brakes even
as the American people continue to resist the idea that Clinton
should be ousted over the Lewinsky affair. ``This has the potential
to be the most divisive issue in American public life since the
Vietnam War,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Two sharply different schools of thought co-exist on Capitol
Hill about how the president's fate will be determined. Which one
prevails could well be decided by the outcome of the elections just
three and a half weeks away, unless Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, changes all the political calculations by forwarding to
Congress new allegations of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first outcome, the Republicans make only modest gains
in November. They decide they have wrung maximum political
advantage out of Clinton's misconduct and that prolonged
impeachment hearings could hurt them going into the 2000
presidential elections. And for a brief window of time, the
pressure to appease the party's conservative base would be off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say now that if nothing more comes out and there is no
dramatic changes of seats in the House and the Senate, this will be
resolved short of impeachment,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. ``If
the elections stalemate, that will be a signal from the American
people not to do impeachment, but to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternate script could play out if the Republicans make
strong inroads in November. Many Republicans have already signaled
their deep belief that Clinton has committed perjury, obstructed
justice, and placed himself above the laws that he has sworn to
uphold.
</P>
<P>
   One of their loudest voices, that of the House majority whip,
accused Democrats Thursday of seeking ``the path of least
resistance. This is when we pitch the law overboard when the mood
fits,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, ``when we ignore the facts in
order to cover up the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   For such Republicans an election sweep would be read as a strong
mandate to move forward with actual impeachment. And it could cause
Democratic unity to crack, putting the president in even more
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats on Thursday were adamant that their few
defections on the inquiry vote mean that they are likely to stand
united against actual impeachment. ``If Republicans are only able
to pick off 15 percent of our members on a procedural vote three
weeks before an election, how many votes are they likely to get
four months from now on articles of impeachment?'' asked one
Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the inquiry is likely to go on hold until after the
elections. Hyde said no hearings would be convened until later in
November. But battles are already brewing between the two parties
over how to conduct the investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has said he sees little reason to bring Ms. Lewinsky
forward in public hearings, but the Democrats are likely to demand
her appearance, adding to the sense of circus on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have impeachment hearings where the star witness is
not called and cross-examined,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
``You have to have Monica Lewinsky testify. You have to have her
mother testify. You have to hear from Betty Currie and Vernon
Jordan.'' And Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that Starr would be someone
the Democrats would want in the witness chair.
</P>
<P>
   As these events move forward, Clinton's aides would dearly love
to find a way to strike a deal on some punishment short of
impeachment _ not in the Senate but before the House takes the
actual impeachment vote, according to a Democratic strategist close
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has thought so often about his legacy, is now
fighting not to become the only other president besides Andrew
Johnson to be impeached by the House. (Nixon resigned after the
House Judiciary Committee reported out three articles of
impeachment and before a House vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is the figure in the House who would have the stature
to broker a deal, and just like Clinton, the speaker has an intense
interest in how he is perceived in history. But it is far from
clear whether the Georgia Republican _ who presided from the
speaker's chair through the entire House debate _ would have any
interest in such a role.
</P>
<P>
   He has his own personal considerations to weigh. He will be
standing for re-election as speaker when the new Congress convenes.
His relations with Clinton have ranged from furious to occasional
moments of alliance, while his relations with House Democrats have
ranged from poor to awful. In a rare bipartisan leadership meeting
over impeachment last month, he lectured House Democrats that he
would be fairer to Clinton than Democrats were to Gingrich when his
ethics troubles resulted in a House reprimand and a $300,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one House Republican with a good antenna for the
speaker's intentions said that should the politics and timing be
right, ``I think he will try to broker a deal. He could come in at
just the right moment and show he's above it all.'' But Rich Galen,
a close associate of Gingrich's, said that if the evidence shows
that Clinton committed perjury under oath, ``I don't think the
speaker will think it's his role to get in the way of that
process.''

CHILEAN U.N. AIDE LINKED TO ABUSES UNDER PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Chilean military officer linked to unlawful executions and
torture during the era of dictator Augusto Pinochet is serving as
the chief military observer of a United Nations mission on the
India-Pakistan border, a human rights group says.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Human Rights Watch, has written to Secretary General
Kofi Annan, asking him to remove the officer, Brig. Gen. Sergio
Espinoza Davies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan is the
organization's longest-running monitoring operation, put in place
in 1949 along the cease-fire line in the disputed territory of
Kashmir, where since 1989 thousands of people have been killed or
detained by Indian troops and remain unaccounted for. Muslim
militants are also accused of abuses against Hindus in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza was assigned to the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping
Operations by the Chilean Defense Ministry, following a common
procedure through which countries ``lend'' military expertise to
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Espinoza case demonstrates one of the pitfalls in this
arrangement. The peacekeeping department, now under the direction
of Under Secretary General Bernard Miyet of France, has neither the
extra staff nor an established process to study thoroughly the
backgrounds of officers or troops assigned to it.
</P>
<P>
   The department, which has relied heavily on borrowed help, faces
even more cuts in its strength because of a general assembly demand
that staff members whose salaries are paid by governments and not
the United Nations be removed from many posts.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts would not necessarily reduce the chances of bad
appointments, however. In the field, peacekeeping operations rely
on many officers and troops from countries where human rights
violations by the military and the police are common. Those are
often the only countries prepared to commit forces to United
Nations operations.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has been a democracy since 1990, but its officer corps has
not been purged of members who served under Pinochet, who did not
retire as army commander until March of this year and is now a
senator for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile is still a country in transition to democracy,'' said
Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of
Human Rights Watch. ``It is essential for the civilian government
to develop a mechanism for screening before international
appointments are made.''
</P>
<P>
   In Santiago, Chilean officials have stood by Espinoza, saying he
is doing a good job. United Nations officials said they had asked
the Chilean government about the complaints but had not received a
reply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Rights Watch believes that Brigadier General Espinoza's
documented participation in the worst human rights abuses in his
home country renders him unfit to lead a peacekeeping mission that
seeks to uphold the international human rights principles upon
which the United Nations was founded,'' the rights organization
said in a letter signed by Vivanco and Joanna Weschler, its U.N.
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza's activities as an army captain and member of war
crimes tribunals set up in 1973 in the early days of Pinochet's
rule were documented by the Chilean National Commission on Truth
and Reconciliation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In one case cited by Human Rights Watch, a panel on which
Espinoza sat sentenced six socialist leaders to death in the city
of Iquique. The crimes against the six, four of whom were executed
immediately, were not proved, the national commission found. The
bodies were never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say the matter is being investigated.

 &HT;    Doctors optimistic regarding Strawberry recovery
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The news gets better for Yankees outfielder Darryl
Strawberry. Doctors said Thursday that he should make a full
recovery and return to baseball next year.
</P>
<P>
   The hope stems from tests that show only one of 36 lymph nodes
removed from Strawberry last week had any evidence of the tumor.
Strawberry is scheduled to leave a New York hospital this weekend
and will start chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Score critical after wreck
</P>
<P>
   Former Indians pitcher and broadcaster Herb Score was seriously
injured Thursday when his car pulled in front of a tractor-trailer.
Score, 65, is in critical condition at Aultman Hospital in Canton,
Ohio, with hip, head and pelvic injuries. . . . October continues
to be a struggle for Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez. Back in
1995 when he was playing for Seattle and faced the Yankees in the
divisional series, he hit .409 with one homer and five RBIs. He's
since a combined 19-for-108 (.176) with one homer and four RBIs.
``It's very frustrating,'' said Martinez, who is 0-for-9 in the
ALCS this year. ``I feel good, I'm relaxed and, all of a sudden,
I'm trying to make things happen that are not there. I'm swinging
at 3-2 pitches that are out of the zone. I'm striking out on bad
pitches. I'm trying to do too much instead of letting things happen
and unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office is reportedly upset at Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner, who threw baseball's public relations staff
out of the team's offices Wednesday, saying he needed the space for
an accountant. But the Yankees said baseball officials made their
own decision to move out of the office to a quieter work space.
Also, the Yankees and Red Sox were fined an undisclosed amount for
not following postseason media guidelines, such as working out on
off days. . . . After what happened in Game 2, Steinbrenner said
the American League should be stripped of its authority over
umpires. ``You bring the officiating under the commissioner's
office,'' he said. ``It doesn't belong under the league offices,''
he said. Like many, Steinbrenner said umpires used in the
postseason should be based on merit and not seniority. ... At
Yankee Stadium, New York fans taunted Cleveland's David Justice
with chants of ``Halle Berry, Halle Berry.'' Berry, an actress, is
Justice's ex-wife and word in the tabloids is they are considering
getting back together.

 &HT;    Klesko's dash: It's `hero or zero' time
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those who thought Ryan Klesko ought to have his head
examined after daring to go from first to third on a Javy Lopez
single Wednesday night got their wish. Klesko had X-rays taken on
the side of his face to see if his nose was broken after his
booming collision with third baseman Ken Caminiti's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko said the X-rays were inconclusive and he may need more.
He's been sore, his left nostril has been bleeding and he's had
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   So how's he breathing? ``Through one nostril,'' Klesko said.
``I'm just glad I'm back in the lineup. I thought I broke it.''
</P>
<P>
   The left fielder added, ``Even if it is broken, it's OK. As long
as it's not crooked, what can you do? I just hope no one taps me on
it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko blamed his helmet, explaining that as he slid in
headfirst, his helmet came down.
</P>
<P>
   Just what was he thinking? ``It's a lot easier to score on
(Trevor) Hoffman from third than from second,'' he said. ``That's
one of the plays where if you don't risk it, it's 'What is he
doing?' It's all hero or zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko didn't realize that anything was wrong until he looked up
at the umpire and tried to ``give a little help'' on the call.
``That's when things started to get fuzzy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making Glavine's case
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Glavine and Hoffman the frontrunners for the Cy Young
award, Greg Maddux said he'd pick Glavine for his second Cy. ``I
think you've got to go with wins,'' said Maddux, who will pitch
Saturday in San Diego. ``That's why you play. You don't play the
game to strike guys out, you play the game to get guys out. You
just play to win. And Glav (20-6) won more games than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux noted that Glavine is throwing better against lefties
than ever before. Left-handers are hitting .245 against Glavine in
220 at-bats, right-handers .235 in 630.
</P>
<P>
   Long haul, not long ball
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was just 21 years and four months old when he hit
his 50th career homer _ making him the third-youngest in major
league history to reach that mark, ``I don't call myself a home run
hitter,'' said Andruw Jones. The center fielder, who his 31 this
season and now has 54 in his career, added a third-inning homer
Wednesday to tie the game at 1. ``I call myself an all-around
player,'' Jones said. ``I do whatever I need to do to help the team
win the game. If I need to hit a home run, I hit a home run. If
somebody make a mistake, you hit the home runs. I'm not like (Mark)
McGwire, or (Sammy) Sosa or (Andres) Galarraga; I can't hit them
every day. I can, but I don't look to do that. I just go out and do
my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming out pitching
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield was going for a strike
out, not a knock out when he threw the first pitch before
Thursday's game. Holyfield's throw was over the inside corner to a
right-handed batter. But if there'd been a real batter, and he'd
hit him, who better in a brawl?

 &HT;    Braves' heartbreakers holding a reunion
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So many have taken turns driving spikes through the
postseason Braves that there's now enough of them to hold a
full-blown reunion.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered at Turner Field this midweek, in the mood to trash
the place and relive old glories. There seems to be a powerful bond
between those who have denied the ``Team of the '90s.'' They even
wear the same uniform, with Padres writ large across their heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, My Name Is Jim Leyritz,'' read one name tag at the
gathering. It was across the street, where cars and armed
highwaymen now park, that Leyritz hit his home run ultimately
turning the 1996 World Series away from Atlanta, toward New York
Yankee clutches. Since then, he has been passed around like a bad
cold, only to show up back here as the Padres' designated
bail-bondsman.
</P>
<P>
   Never think for a moment that Leyritz would treat his infamous
eighth-inning home run off Mark Wohlers as an accident of fate.
Popping a couple more out against Houston in the division series
just past, he believes himself a master of the moment. When the
Padres acquired Leyritz from Boston in late June, he proclaimed,
``Somewhere down the line (the Red Sox) are going to miss me being
there. When it comes down to crunch time, hopefully those kids will
come through for them. I know I would have. I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Braves were starting to get over him, he comes
back, head shaved for that always attractive death row look. During
Wednesday's Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, he
stepped up as a pinch-hitter and created problems even though he
didn't get the ball out of the infield. It was his dribbler that
set in motion Andres Galarraga's two errors that pushed across one
of San Diego's three runs. He can pummel, or he can prickle.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Game 2 starter, Kevin Brown, is another of the great
foils in Braves history. It only intensifies the irritation that he
is a neighbor, with his Macon and Georgia Tech connections.
</P>
<P>
   As a Florida Marlin, of course, the great grump Brown twice beat
the Braves in the last NLCS. When the Marlins blew up, Brown landed
in San Diego. There is no getting rid of Brown, he's the kudzu
growing on the Braves reputation.
</P>
<P>
   A new face to the gathering is Andy Ashby, who pitched so well
in Game 1 of this NLCS, and was 2-0, with a 1.80 ERA against the
Braves this season. According how this series unwinds, he could be
a permanent member of the Braves-bashers, invited back for all the
mixers and golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Morris, Kirby Puckett, Ed Sprague, Lenny Dykstra and Livan
Hernandez were unable to be here, and they send their regrets.
</P>
<P>
   There's a basic problem when a franchise's list of
heart-breakers is threatening to grow longer than its roster of
heroes. It tells you that here in October where every move is
subject to DNA analysis, the Braves often have broken beneath the
scrutiny. Entering Thursday's Game 2, there was the great need for
someone in a Braves uniform _ maybe even someone other than a
pitcher _ to make the dramatic play, to stand tall when it mattered
most. Maybe Chipper Jones could stay with a tag this time, or drive
in a run or three. Or Galarraga might stir from his autumn daze.
Just to make this party interesting.

 &HT;    Gwynn spokesman for media-shy team
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For what might generally be considered playing for a
small-market club, the San Diego Padres tend to be a media-shy
bunch. Most of them sought shelter in the player's-only lounge
rather than venture into the clubhouse after winning Game 1, and
that speaks volumes about their accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   A major exception is Tony Gwynn, the club's elder statesman and
resident philosopher. Gwynn didn't go to bed until 5 a.m. after
Game 1 and was back at Turner Field by noon Thursday, offering his
baseball pearls before and after Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   _On the postseason: ``You get in the postseason and the first
thing that jumps out _ TV controls everything. ... You know they
want to see Atlanta-New York. You can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   _On a sub-par 1998 season by his lofty standards: ``This is one
year where I got to convince myself I can still play. I struggled,
but I think I know why. I don't think it's age. I don't think I'm
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   _On when he'll know when to retire: ``I can't say I have to do
this and this. It's not numbers. I'll know. You hope you're man
enough to step up and say it's time to go. ... I'd ike to play
through 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   _On his post-playing career: ``I thought a few years ago that I
might want to be a GM. Not anymore. The game is changing ... but I
believe I should be in the game somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What pressure?
</P>
<P>
   First, left-hander Sterling Hitchcock found himself matched up
with Randy Johnson in Game 4 of the NL Division Series _ and won.
Now, in Game 3 of the NLCS, he draws four-time Cy Young winner Greg
Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no pressure on me,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm not supposed
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn ready
</P>
<P>
   With a strained left quadricep suffered Wednesday night on a
Chipper-Jones line drive, Greg Vaughn understands why he can't play
the outfield. But he made it very clear to manager Bruce Bochy that
he's ready to swing a bat.
</P>
<P>
   So would he be able to pinch-hit in a couple of days?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to pinch-hit in a couple of hours,'' he said
prior to Game 2. ``I've been a quick healer in the past and I can
tolerate a lot of pain. The only thing is in the outfield, I don't
want to be the reason for us to lose the ballgame because I can't
run to get a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres medical staff thinks the injury will keep Vaughn out
``possibly three to four days, but it could be up to 10 days,''
said manager Bruce Bochy. He said he'd check with the doctors to
see if Vaughn can hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be OK, but I feel like I let the team down because I
waited until this point in the year to get hurt,'' Vaughn said.
``They depend on me to be out there with them to go to war, and I
can't go to wa ... right now.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 starter Kevin Brown, born in McIntyre and living now in
Macon, has the strongest Georgia ties, but he isn't the only Padre
hailing from the state. Probable Game 4 starter Joey Hamilton
spends his offseason in Atlanta and Wally Joyner is a Redan High
graduate. ... Technically, the Padres continued their late-inning
dominance by taking Game 1, 178-0 since late in the 1996 season
when leading after eight innings. Padres closer Trevor Hoffman blew
a ninth-inning save opportunity, but Ken Caminiti's 10th-inning
homer nailed down the win.

 &HT;    Prices at root of fan apathy?
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a lovely night for baseball _ 62 degrees,
14-mph winds blowing left to right _ but Game 2 of the National
League Championship Series Thursday began with many, many empty
seats at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   There was no threat of rain like the night before, when the
weather helped produce the smallest playoff crowd in Atlanta
history, 42,117.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Atlanta's reputation as being indifferent or
apathetic to the postseason is being examined. It's a story as old
as David Justice, the former Atlanta outfielder who once chided the
town for sleeping through World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   One local sports talk radio station has already had Mayor Bill
Campbell on live trying to stroke the city's psyche. But the bulk
of the mayor's chat may represent part of the problem: He asked his
studio hosts what he should bet the mayor of New York on the World
Series. Like many Atlanta fans, he appears to be already looking
ahead to a matchup with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger truth may be economics. ``There is a little fan
apathy,'' fan Jan Watson said. ``They expect us to win. I was kind
appalled to hear that these games weren't sellouts. But (Major
League Baseball) raising the ticket prices didn't help any.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the NLCS cost $45 and $75.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is a serious Braves fan. She has season tickets in the
upper deck and showed up Thursday night in her lucky Indian
headdress. But she said she had to come up with more than $1,000
for two tickets to the playoffs and Series. In cash. No credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very good job and can afford these, but some people
can't,'' she said. ``The deadline for ordering the postseason
tickets is Sept. 4 and the refunds for games that are not played
you don't get back for eight weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons for poor fan turnout: Day games have been a tough
sell in Atlanta, and, some say, the Braves just win too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever get used to winning,'' David Yuhasz
said, but the fans do have their limits when it comes to
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Yuhasz fought the traffic, then the rain, went
so far as to pay to park and then bailed out of going into the
stadium. ``I was betting on a rainout and getting to use those
tickets again,'' he said. ``If they'd had a fireplace in here, I'd
have come in and curled up to go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, said baseball is pricing itself out of fan support. ``A
family of four getting the most inexpensive seats ($35 each) would
have to spend $140, then maybe $100 on top of that for food. That's
a lot of money for a family outing when they could call Domino's or
Pizza Hut and order a pizza for twenty bucks.''

 &HT;    Like most postseason series, this one is on the pitchers
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Vaughn hit 50 home runs this season, more than
anyone in the National League except those two guys who chased,
caught and passed Roger Maris. He is, you'd surmise, a significant
piece of the San Diego Padres' team.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when word came Thursday that Vaughn possibly would be
sidelined for the rest of the NLCS, you didn't sense a dramatic
shift in the balance of power between the Padres and the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Nor even a subtle one.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of San Diego's team home-run total was deleted
from the lineup with one strained left quadricep muscle, suffered
by Vaughn the night before. Bad break for the Padres, yes, and
certainly one that made it easier for Tom Glavine to navigate the
middle of their batting order Thursday night. But this series does
not hinge on sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   It hinges, as do almost all postseason series, on the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had the most prolific offense in the National League
this season, yet did nothing against San Diego in the Division
Series. Sammy Sosa hit 66 home runs in the regular season, yet hit
nothing against the Braves in the first round. The Yankees managed
one run in 12 innings against Cleveland Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you know October baseball works. This is old hat around
here, as attested by all those empty seats in the upper deck in
right field. Whichever team pitches the best wins, provided that
team also makes the plays defensively, executes a few little things
offensively and has a modicum of good fortune here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-homer hitters are, in a word, optional.
</P>
<P>
   ''The teams that are in postseason, they have the dominating
pitching in their league,'' Bobby Cox was saying before Thursday's
game. ''And you're running up against an outstanding starter every
single night. Guys like Pedro Martinez, (Kevin) Brown, (Greg)
Maddux, (John) Smoltz, (Tom) Glavine, (Andy) Ashby, they don't give
up runs even during the regular season. Nothing honestly changes
much during the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that the starting pitchers with the marginal stuff and
lofty ERAs are home for the winter _ along with a lot of power
hitters whose teams didn't have enough pitching to get to the
second week of October.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that neither Mark McGwire nor Sosa are still
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how this San Diego team compares offensively with last
year's Florida team, Greg Maddux said: ''Really, all the teams are
the same that you face. Everybody has one or two guys that can run,
one or two guys that hit for power, one or two who hit for average.
Some righties and some lefties thrown in there. ... And I think
this whole pitching staff believes that good pitching will beat
good hitting any day of the week, regardless of who you're
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's ability to play defense, not his ability to swing a
bat, will solely determine when or whether he gets back in the
lineup. Bruce Bochy, the San Diego manager, said heprobably will
miss three to four days, possibly up to 10 days. That diminishes
the Padres' offense, sure. But it doesn't diminish their chances of
winning this series, which hinge on who's pitching, not who's
playing left field.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with Vaughn's 50 homers on the bench, Brown and Glavine
went at it Thursday night, just as Ashby and Smoltz did on
Wednesday night.

 &HT;    Dwight has 2 gears: fast and warp speed
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You knew someone like Tim Dwight. He was the little
kid in grade school who always seemed to be in motion, talking all
the time, driving everybody nuts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a scab on his forehead, his nose, somewhere. Half the
class wanted to beat him up, but nobody could catch him. If they
did, he'd battle to the end.
</P>
<P>
   He was the pest.
</P>
<P>
   Well, tiny Tim has grown up _ sort of. He's the smallest Falcon
at 5-feet-8, and 181 pounds, nearly juvenile as ever, and still a
pest of sorts. But now it's NFL teams he's driving bananas, as a
rookie kick returner, wide receiver, running back and even passer
for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight was named NFC special-teams player of the week after
returning the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown in last
Sunday's 51-23 blowout of Carolina. For good measure, he threw a
22-yard pass to quarterback Chris Chandler, and carried the ball
two times for 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes all out on every play,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves
said. ``He hits that crease at 90 mph, and he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed much in Dwight's 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   He's always been fast: ``In sixth grade, he went to (AAU track)
nationals,'' said his father, Tim Sr. ``He would have won (the 200
meters), but he fell out of the blocks ... got up and finished
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight's always lived his life at high speeds, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to try to get a bit of an `edge' once in a while,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So a couple years ago, he jumped off a 90-foot cliff into the
Wisconsin River. ``It was higher than I thought,'' he said. ``On
the way down, I was like, `Oh ... my ... God!' ``
</P>
<P>
   We're talking a change of pace here, a guy who, despite a
$225,000 signing bonus as a fourth-round draft choice out of the
University of Iowa, drives a friend's very beat-up 1987 Isuzu
``Pup'' pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Wednesday, Dwight was doing back flips _ with no
hands!
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wild character,'' recalled Jacksonville rookie
running back and former Iowa teammate Tavian Banks. ``He'd come to
practice with his face painted. I remember he jumped out of a
four-story dorm (three, Dwight said) into a snow bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to wrestle (former Iowa teammates) Scott Slutzker (a
6-4, 250-pound tight end with the Saints), and Ross Verba (a 6-4,
304-pound tackle with the Packers). He had a few moves, then it
would be over, he'd get flattened, and he'd get up talking trash.
He's just hyper.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight said that's not quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not hyper; I couldn't control myself. I was just active,''
said Dwight, who, according to his father, refused training wheels
while learning to ride a bike. ``I couldn't sit around the house. I
liked being outdoors, playing sports, being with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons like Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed up in June, with a scab on his nose from a
``scrap'' with a friend, Chandler gave him the nickname ``Mutt.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, does it fit. Dwight often dresses like he's getting ready
to rake leaves, needles people ceaselessly, gives kidney shots to
unsuspecting reporters, drives that truck, and with a prematurely
receding hairline and very little, very short blond hair, he looks
the part.
</P>
<P>
   But this mutt can haul.
</P>
<P>
   He used his speed _ good enough to qualify for the NCAA meet in
the 100 (top time of 10.31 seconds) and 200 (top time of 20.99)
meters _ to set a slew of school records at Iowa. He has a season
of track eligiblity left, and will run next spring while finishing
his sports-management degree.
</P>
<P>
   He led the NCAA last year with a 19.3-yard punt return average
and three TDs. While at Iowa, he returned five punts for TDs,
rushed for six TDs and an 8.7-yard average, threw for two TDs,
caught 127 passes and 21 TDs, and occasionally played defense.
</P>
<P>
   He caught a 44-yard TD pass in the opening game, a 19-14 win at
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And he's doing other things. Two weeks ago, he debuted in the
Falcons' backfield, rushing two times at San Francisco for 7 yards,
and running a reverse for 5 yards. He also got a new scab on his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   With running back Byron Hanspard out for the season with a knee
injury, Dwight, who's the same height and three pounds heavier than
Tampa Bay running back Warrick Dunn, will continue to work a little
at halfback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to use him that way because he's
explosive,'' Reeves said. ``He's a heck of a football player, and a
tough son of a gun. But he's got to learn to dodge some of those
guys instead of running over them (or trying to hurdle them).''
</P>
<P>
   True to his Midwestern roots, and a good bit like his father, a
high school history teacher, head track coach and football
assistant, Dwight was raised polite, sincere, and straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   After living his entire life in Iowa City, he said, ``I love
Atlanta because people are nice. Plus, I can go out and people
don't know me. I tell them I'm a construction worker, or a
third-grade teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight has always had that wide-open throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have wooden steps going to the basement with openings
between the steps,'' said his grandmother, Betty Tiemeier. ``(When
Dwight was a boy) the boys were down there, and all of a sudden,
Tim's cousins came up and said, 'Oh, Grandma, come down quick.
Timmy's stuck!'
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could get his head through the steps. Grandpa
had to go down and get the crowbar and pry the step loose to get
him out.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't pry the Dwight family loose from the TV on Sundays.
They'll charter a bus for family and friends, and drive it to St.
Louis when the Falcons play the Rams on Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, they gather around the TV at Tim's parents' home
in Iowa City. They went a little nuts last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought a satellite dish, and got the NFL package,'' his
father said. ``We're real strong on family. We have a lot of
relatives and friends over. We cook up a big pot of chili, and have
a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional when Timmy took that kickoff back. We
were all jumping up and down, and (Dwight's mother) Nancy gave me a
hug.''

 &HT;    Chiefs eye erratic Bledsoe
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The good news for the New England Patriots is that
Drew Bledsoe got through the first three games of this season
without throwing an interception. The bad news is that the
sixth-year veteran may have picked the most inopportune time to
have his erratic persona surface again.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe tossed three interceptions last week and the Pats needed
a last-minute field goal to edge underdog New Orleans. Now fast
forward to Sunday, when the Patriots face Kansas City in this
weekend's best matchup. If last week represented one of those dips
which have characterized Bledsoe's rollercoaster career, he could
have a difficult time getting back over the hump against the
opportunistic Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year in and year out, we pride ourselves on taking (the ball)
away from people,'' said Chiefs cornerback Dale Carter, whose
third-quarter interception was the turning point in last Sunday
night's ``Monsoon Bowl'' victory over Seattle. ``It's just a
mindset with us. We create a lot of opportunities for our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous 10 seasons, the Chiefs led the league in
turnover differential, with a plus-96 mark. Not surprisingly, coach
Marty Schottenheimer's club enters the game at Foxboro Stadium with
an NFL-best 16 takeaways in '98. That total includes 11 fumble
recoveries, tangible evidence of the emphasis coordinator Gunther
Cunningham placed on stripping the ball in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Patriots and Chiefs figure to be no worse than
wild-card teams, there is a sense of urgency for both franchises
this week. New England could open a solid lead in the AFC East over
the next few weeks as rival Miami faces a daunting schedule. The
Chiefs probably would fall two games behind undefeated Denver in
the AFC West if they lose to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches have stressed wrapping up the ball at all times,''
said Robert Edwards, the former Georgia tailback who has
re-energized the New England rushing game. ``Against the Chiefs,
that's a must. Those guys have very busy hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``bests'' for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: Starting with the marquee Chiefs-Patriots
game, the possibilities abound. Atlanta could dump the flagging
Giants. Chicago will have as many expatriate fans at Sun Devil
Stadium as the Cardinals. The Jeff George-less Raiders may struggle
at home against San Diego. But we like the Bengals, who have only
beaten the Steelers once in the last seven meetings in Cincinnati,
to prevail. An already shaky Pittsburgh offense is reshuffling the
line again. That could be a treat for Bengals coordinator Dick
LeBeau, who once plied his zone-blitzes in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: When people note Carolina linebacker Kevin
Greene ``knows all the tricks,'' it's a polite way of saying the
league sack leader bends the rules. And Dallas offensive tackle
Erik Williams has led the NFL in holding and
illegal-hands-to-the-face penalties the last two years. It could be
Flag Day at Texas Stadium on Sunday when the two square off on
passing downs. On Monday night, watching Jacksonville tackle Tony
Boselli block Miami speed-rusher Jason Taylor will be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: The Tennessee secondary is a step slow and
Baltimore wideout Jermaine Lewis is a flat-out sprinter. Ravens
quarterback Eric Zeier will hook up for at least one bomb to Lewis
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: If George Young were still the Giants general
manager, it would spice up Dan Reeves' return to New York. Instead,
Bengals quarterback Neil O'Donnell will feel some heat from his
former Steelers teammates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: The Saints probably can't match up with San
Francisco's three wide receivers. But innovative New Orleans
defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian could keep things close for a
while by creating pressure on Steve Young.

 &HT;    Road Atlanta fans begin arriving for Petit Le Mans
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world of sports car racing, temporarily
headquartered near Braselton at Road Atlanta, must be sending
telegrams back to Europe and the Far East marveling at how Don
Panoz controls the weather.
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves were a washout until the wee hours of Thursday,
the first practice for Saturday's Petit Le Mans had near perfect
weather Thursday afternoon. Bright sunshine, nice breeze, no need
for a sweat towel around the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many fans were on-site yet, but the Johnson family of
Marietta has already staked out the second-best site at the track.
The Porsche tent about 50 yards away has the best.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnsons, Ivy III, Gayle, sons Ivy IV, Jimmy and Mi-chael,
are at Road Atlanta for the weekend with two family tents and a
screen tent serving as the kitchen. The site is two feet from the
chain link fence opposite the area known as the ``esses.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where cars running 100 or so miles per hour uphill from
turn one have to brake, downshift and zig-zag down to about 50 mph,
trying to stay in control and not hit anybody and then hit the
accelerator again. It gets hairy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where all the wrecks happen,'' said Ivy III. ``This is
the best kind of racing I've ever seen. It's a lot better than
NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: ``It'll take until about next Thursday to get our
hearing back.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever sees the field go all the way around a road course,
there are too many hills, but there is a huge amount of space along
the fence and around the infield of the 2.6-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   Those who haven't been at Road Atlanta since July are astonished
at the changes. There is a new, huge paddock and pits area on the
infield side of the track where the Le Mans cars are staged.
</P>
<P>
   Early arrivals got some early thrills by watching practice
sessions Thursday. The 24 Hours of Le Mans winning No. 26 Porsche
911 GT showed its speed and agility as drivers Uwe Alzen of
Germany, Yannick Dalmas of France and Scotland's Allan McNish took
their turns and ran up a fast-lap speed of 124.79 mph. The No. 5
Panoz, driven by Eric Bernard, Paris, Johnny O'Connell, Phoenix and
Jamie Davies of England was the fourth-fastest at 121.24 and No. 4
GT1, driven by David Brabham, England, Andy Wallace, France and
Scott Pruitt of Granite Bay, Calif., was seventh-fastest at 119.72.
The hybrid V8/electric Panoz GT1 had a best lap of 117.47, good
enough for 10th-fastest of the afternoon.

ON BASEBALL: UMPIRES, LIKE LIFE, ARE NOT ALWAYS FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In earlier eras in baseball, umpires felt they were
doing a good job if no one noticed them or talked about them. In
this year's playoffs, people everywhere have noticed the umpires
and, oh, are they talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   Take Joe Brinkman, for example. Brinkman leaped out of anonymity
in the second game of the division series between Cleveland and the
Boston Red Sox, ejecting Indians' manager Mike Hargrove three
pitches into the game, and then Dwight Gooden after he had faced
only four batters and thrown 22 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was irate over Brinkman's calls on some of those 22
pitches, and he disputed a Brinkman call at the plate that
television replays showed was clearly wrong. This all happened only
a couple of weeks after Marty Springstead, the American League's
executive director of umpiring, wrote Brinkman a letter about his
positioning behind the plate. It is a subject that the league has
periodically discussed with Brinkman, who sets up farther from the
catcher than other umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you can't see the plate from that far behind the
catcher,'' a member of the Cleveland organization said, speaking on
the condition of anonymity because umpires can strike back. ``I
don't see how a call can be made up and down or in and out
consistently that far back. It's totally unprofessional.''
</P>
<P>
   If Brinkman caught people's attention with his calls in
Cleveland on Sept. 30, Ted Hendry absolutely grabbed everyone by
the lapels with his calls Wednesday in New York. A practitioner of
the wide, wide strike zone that has been adopted by an increasing
number of umpires, Hendry capped a controversial night of
ball-strike calls by ruling that Travis Fryman did not interfere
with Tino Martinez's throw to Chuck Knoblauch at first base in the
12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was calling some terrible pitches on both sides,'' said
Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel. ``The whole thing was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatter strike zone is a relatively recent development, only
a few years in the making. Umpires long ago stopped using the
rule-book strike zone, ignoring the part of the zone above the
waist. But now some umpires call strikes on pitches that are
several inches from either side of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Paul O'Neill of the Yankees said. ``I
don't know if they're intentionally doing it to speed games up. But
if the strike zone is here,'' he said, gesturing with his hand,
``they're going to throw it there. If it's here, they're going to
throw it there. As wide as they go, the pitchers are going to
continually throw wider and wider.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said batters would much rather see the high strike
called than the wide strike. ``The high strike you can still hack
at it, foul it off or something,'' he said. ``But that ball six
inches off the plate sinking away and they force you to swing at
it, you can't hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some umpires call low strikes, some call high strikes, O'Neill
added, ``but it seems like everybody likes the wide pitch now.''
Wide outside or inside, he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly outside,'' he said. ``If you give them both, you might
as well go up there without a bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said players don't mind a different strike zone if
umpires stick to it. ``It's our job to adjust to that strike
zone,'' the manager said. ``Nobody has a problem with that. What's
a problem is one time this is a ball and the next time it's a
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hirschbeck, the umpire who will go down in history with
Roberto Alomar, probably has the widest strike zone in the American
League, Hargrove said. ``But he probably has less arguments because
you know what his strike zone is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure why the wider zone has emerged, but one
American League manager offered a theory. ``I think the umpires
hear people say that the reason games are too long is we need a
bigger strike zone. I've heard an umpire say as recently as three
weeks ago, `The more strikes I call, the less trouble I get into.'
I think they listen to the criticism and they say: `Oh yeah? Watch
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with their predecessors, today's umpires are also
generally more confrontational. Instead of walking away from a
manager or a player who wants to argue, umpires often look for
arguments, following a manager or a player back toward the dugout
to continue the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The same manager told of some umpires who make a ball or strike
call, then look straight at him in the dugout ``waiting for me to
say something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Umpires say, `Now don't you come out here,''' the manager
related. ``I've got 25 players who have just heard him tell me I
can't do something. I can't not go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee coach Don Zimmer recalled how umpires used to treat
arguments. ''Years ago, if you had a beef, they'd listen to your
beef if it was legitimate and you did it the right way. When they
had enough, they'd say `Get away from me.' If you didn't get away,
you were out. Today, with some of them, you say something from the
dugout, off comes the mask and they cuss at you. If I cuss at them,
I get fined. That just happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer referred to the $300 fine he incurred from a brawl
between the Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view among baseball people is that the umpires
have turned more confrontational, in some cases vindictive, at the
urging of their union leader, Richie Phillips, who has maintained a
militant stance during his years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has had much to do with the method of selection of
umpires for post-season games. In an earlier collective bargaining
agreement, umpires were chosen strictly on a rotating basis. The
leagues have long wanted a merit system, but the best they got was
the compromise that exists in the current agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system in use, all umpires are eligible for
post-season series and the All-Star Game. However, an umpire cannot
work more than one ``special event'' except he can work a division
series and the World Series. Furthermore, no umpire can work two
successive World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The American League staff has 32 umpires. Twenty-four are needed
for the so-called special events. Selection was limited for this
post-season, said league senior vice president Phyllis Merhige,
because six umpires are hurt and unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre did not like Hendry's work Wednesday
and said so publicly in uncharacteristically harsh and outspoken
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate I'll get fined,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry only got noticed.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS MADE 3 MISTAKES ON ONE PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is wrong with Coach George? At the very time the
New York Yankees needed a football-style, two-a-day drill on the
fine art of throwing the baseball to first base, Coach George was
fighting a grudge match with the baseball establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about who is to blame for the Yankees' being in
trouble. Their fielders committed a triple play of blunders in
their perhaps-soon-to-be-legendary loss Wednesday to the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The fault is in the Yankees' execution rather than the umpires
or the rules or the runner _ or even ``Dr. Gene Budig,'' as Coach
George calls him, as if there is something suspicious about the
American League president's holding a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things wrong with the major-league umpires:
their strike zones are puffed up out of proportion, and so are
their attitudes. But the umps did not put the Yankees in this
dumbfounding position of actually having lost a game in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   In the bad old days, if the Yankees had botched a vital play to
lose a game, Coach George would have had them out sweating in
Cleveland on Thursday, working on one simple play: throwing the
runner out at first base. The players could have taken turns
running down the base line while the pitchers, catchers, first
basemen and second baseman worked on their basics.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the replay a few dozen times and come to the
conclusion that Tino Martinez was wrong in plugging the Indians'
Travis Fryman between the shoulder blades and that Chuck Knoblauch
was equally at fault for not giving Martinez a target on the
infield side of first base.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ball bounced off Fryman, Knoblauch lost his composure
and argued with the umpire rather than chasing the ball. He
maturely admitted his mental error Thursday, but still, that was
only the third mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees argued that Fryman had run on the fair side of the
base line and should have been ruled out for interference, but the
crew chief of the umpires, Jim Evans, insisted, ``There is nothing
illegal about going around the pitcher's mound in your route to
first base.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the concept of a runner's gamboling around the
greensward, making a leisurely route toward first base. But Evans'
point is well taken (at least by me). ``In this case, the problem
happened right at the base,'' Evans said. ``It happened on the
base. So that is what the plate umpire, Ted Hendry, based his
ruling on, the fact that he has a right to be in fair territory at
the base. Again, if a throw is on the second base side of the base
and not right at the base, it doesn't hit him, they probably retire
him or it is a bang, bang play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryman deserves credit for making an excellent bunt (only the
second time all year he had been asked to bunt), forcing Martinez
to hurry his throw, while Knoblauch ran to cover, expecting to
catch the ball right over first base.
</P>
<P>
   This is wrong. Every team sport has the concept of putting the
ball (or puck) where a teammate will be. Martinez should have
thrown the ball to the left of the runner's back, on the fair side
of first base. Given the accuracy of players' arms, it is
reasonable to expect Knoblauch to have been able to give a target
and catch a ball streaking past the runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees should have run that play 1,000 times in spring
training, the same way that pitchers practice covering first base
on the first day they report _ a good play to sweat out all the
poisons accumulated in the body and the mind from sitting in front
of the tube all winter.
</P>
<P>
   It worries me that Coach George concentrated on lambasting ``Dr.
Gene Budig,'' given George's traditional fixation with his brief
career as an assistant college coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, now there's a real football guy for you. The
affable coach of the New York Jets would have kicked the Yankees in
their sore spots Thursday, and then ordered them to practice the
throw to first base until they whimpered for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Coach George can rant all he wants about needing one set of
umpires rather than having the two leagues with different ways of
perching behind the catcher, two sets of interpretations of rules,
two enlarged strike zones. In that, Coach George is absolutely
right. I'm sure the new commissioner will get right on this.
</P>
<P>
   However, rather than punish and bully his players, Coach George
dickered and dithered about even holding a workout on the off day,
which was mandated by league laws. This only tells me he really is
going to sell the Yankees to some other guy from Cleveland like
Charles Dolan of Cablevision. Coach George is going soft. Never
thought I'd see the day.

JAPANESE LEADER APOLOGIZES FOR OCCUPATION OF KOREA

 (SUBS to rewrite final sentence)  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Seeking to forge a new relationship with the Korean
people, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered an unusually forthright
apology Thursday for Japanese colonial occupation of the Korean
peninsula early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   In the complex politics of apology, which play an important role
in Japan's relations with its neighbors, Thursday's statement
marked one more step toward greater public contrition for World War
II, and South Korea seemed pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese statement came in a meeting with the visiting South
Korean president, Kim Dae-jung. Past visits by South Korean leaders
were also occasions for Japanese apologies, but this time the
statement was given extra weight by being included in the joint
declaration issued by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obuchi, looking back on the relations between Korea and Japan
in this century, humbly accepted the historical fact that the
Japanese colonial rule inflicted unbearable damage and pain on
Korean people and expressed remorseful repentance and heartfelt
apology for the ordeal,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The wording was based on a landmark 1995 speech by Tomiichi
Murayama, who was then prime minister, about Japanese conduct
during World War II. But in some ways Thursday's statement went
further because it was part of an official declaration, while
Murayama's speech had been personal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Murayama is a socialist who is outside the Japanese
mainstream, while Obuchi is a central figure in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's statement was directed only at Korea. But if the
Japanese government likes the response, it could be used as the
basis for a more general official apology for Japanese conduct
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from North Korea, with which
Japan's relationship is extremely chilly.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia continues to be haunted by the war, even after 53
years, and Koreans and Chinese in particular are deeply suspicious
that Japan feels insufficient remorse and might again become a
military power if it had the chance. Japan, on the other hand,
feels its neighbors are being unreasonable by demanding one apology
after another from a country where the great majority of citizens
have no memory of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions are particularly great with Korea, which Japan
brutally occupied from 1910 until the end of the war in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Japan may have been willing to make an unusually humble apology
in this case in part because President Kim is seen as a genuine
peacemaker who wants to improve ties, rather than as a hostile
figure who will use Thursday's statement to try to extort more aid.
Indeed, Kim has gone out of the way here to talk about the need to
build a ``future-oriented relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim also said South Korea would move quickly to relax its ban on
Japanese music and movies, underscoring the thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
   Within Japan, the apology seemed to get broad support, but some
officials in the Liberal Democratic Party have complained, saying
Japan helped Korea during the colonial period and has no need to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean newspapers welcomed the Japanese apology, with the
Chosun Ilbo calling it a ``significant event'' and the Jong-ang
Ilbo saying it had ``special meaning'' because it was focused on
Korea rather than a general statement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the resentments in Korea run deep, and many Koreans want
to see not just words but also a broad effort by Japan to pay
official compensation to Koreans who were war-time sex slaves of
the imperial army or who were forced laborers constructing tunnels
and doing other work in Japan for the war effort. So far Japan has
offered informal private payments to the former sex slaves, but has
refused to consider official compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim spoke frankly to the Japanese parliament, saying ``doubts
and mistrust'' about Japan are widespread in Asia because of
Japan's reluctance to face the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan needs true courage to look at the past squarely and
respect the judgment of history,'' he declared. ``South Korea
should also rightly evaluate Japan, in all its changed aspects, and
search with hope for future possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In one indication of the continuing tensions, Kim spoke to the
parliament in Korean, even though he speaks fluent Japanese from
his childhood in the colonial era. In the United States, he spoke
in English to a joint meeting of Congress, but aides said it would
be politically impossible for Kim to deliver an address in Japanese
because of its bitter associations with the colonial period.

   GLOBAL TURMOIL MAY SLOW NATION'S BUOYANT ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets were jittery as more investors began to
fear the country cannot avoid the economic slowdown that has
gripped much of the world. The value of the dollar dropped further,
interest rates rose and the prices of many stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,731.91, lower by
just 8.78 points after being down as much as 274 points during the
day Thursday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.24
points, or 1.16 percent, to 959.44, while the Nasdaq index dropped
43.49 points, or 2.97 percent, to 1,419.12, its lowest close in 16
months.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities ended mixed, with selling by hedge funds
battering the long end of the market even as shorter maturities
were bolstered by weakness in equities. The 30-year bond fell more
than two points for a second consecutive day, while the yield rose
to 4.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by
one-quarter of a percentage point, reflecting concern about global
financial turmoil and fears of recession among British exporters
and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   NO TAXES FOR CYBERSPACE PURCHASES
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted overwhelmingly to make cyberspace a tax-free
zone for most transactions for the next three years.

<P>
   JUDGE DEALS MICROSOFT A SETBACK
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dealt Microsoft a setback in its antitrust trial
preparations by denying the company access to the interview tapes
and transcripts for a new book written by two business school
professors.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL SALES ROSE 4.5% LAST MONTH
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.5 percent in
September with discounters reporting strong gains, while department
stores had only slim gains.
</P>
<P>
   CBS NEWS CUTTING 120 EMPLOYEES
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, has laid off about 7
percent of the network's staff, or 120 workers, in an effort to
save $40 million, or about 10 percent of the CBS News budget.
Competitors ABC News and NBC News have also reduced their staff,
but have not announced by how many.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. TO BEAR MOST OF IMF BURDEN
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank wound up
their annual meetings saying that the United States will bear most
of the burden of helping Asia and the rest of the developing world
get out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Congressional leaders presented the Clinton
administration with a list of lending conditions that they want
imposed on the IMF in order for Congress to approve $18 billion in
new money for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL ELECTRIC PROFIT RISES 13%

YANKS TRY TO PUT SNAFU BEHIND THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The New York Yankees were hesitant to open the doors
to the visiting clubhouse before their optional workout at Jacobs
Field on Thursday afternoon. Just wait for some more players to
arrive, they requested. It was a curious decision because Chuck
Knoblauch, the Yankee virtually everyone wanted to interview, had
already strolled in.
</P>
<P>
   Once the doors opened and minutes before Knoblauch finally
blamed himself for not retrieving a very important and very loose
baseball on a disputed play Wednesday night, a bunch of Yankees
were methodically returning to work. There were 14 Yankees who
worked out on the day after Knoblauch's brain cramp, 14 Yankees who
did not want to sit in a hotel room, go see a movie or watch a
sports highlight show and possibly see that devastating sequence
again. The empty ball park was their refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for us to come back and keep doing what got
us here,'' Tim Raines said. ``I don't think anyone is about to jump
ship. We still think we've got the best team in the American
League. We had opportunities to win that game and we didn't. No one
in here thinks it's the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill certainly looked relaxed in a T-shirt and sliding
shorts, with his legs stretched between two folding chairs. O'Neill
would have preferred to talk about Friday's Game 3 of the AL
Championship Series against Cleveland, but the Yankees were forced
to rehash the gory details of the 4-1 loss to the Indians. It was
not as arduous for them as it obviously was for Knoblauch, New
York's newest villain. Still, only a series victory will make the
memories of this bizarre play fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a ball rolling around now, I'm sure nine guys will
be running after it,'' O'Neill said. ``It's easy to say now. It's
almost comical.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing comical about botching the chance to go
ahead, 2-0, in the four-of-seven-game series. Now the Yankees, a
mighty team that had some observers thinking sweep after burying
the Indians, 7-2, in the opener, must hope that Andy Pettitte can
pitch effectively for a second straight start and that their
offense awakens against Bartolo Colon.
</P>
<P>
   This is a much stickier scenario for the Yankees since the
series is tied and the next three games will be played in a park
where the Indians have won 63 percent of their games in the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was a huge momentum swing,'' Chili Davis
said. ``If I was in Cleveland's shoes, I would think there's
somewhat of a momentum swing. Now they've got three games at home.
If we play well, we'll beat them. If not, we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had initially announced Wednesday night that they
would not hold a workout Thursday, but they changed plans after the
AL reminded them that it is mandatory and that they would be fined
if they did not have one.
</P>
<P>
   So manager Joe Torre called for the optional session. As it was,
the Yankees were fined $25,000 for restricting the news media's
access to the field before Game 1, and the Boston Red Sox were
fined $25,000 for not working out on an off day during the division
series last week. The Yankees were at Jacobs Field on Thursday so
there were no more fines. Just some one-liners from Torre, whose
quips made it seem as if he had already forgotten Wednesday's
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame today
and then they all asked me for tickets and I couldn't get them,''
Torre said. ``Basically, a few guys wanted to hit so I allowed it
to be just optional. So I really didn't change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When Torre was asked if he wanted to bypass the workout so
players could erase what had happened, he did not deny that he
wanted to give them a mental holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the intention, but not because of the screwed-up
game,'' Torre said. ``I think if we had lost the game in just the
pedestrian way with a home run, I'd have felt the same way. It had
nothing to do with trying to hide out from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be nowhere for Pettitte to hide Friday night. He
guided the Yankees to a 3-1 victory over Texas in Game 2 of the
division series with eight dependable innings, cutting away some of
the doubts about him after he slogged through August and September
with a 3-5 record and a 6.14 ERA. Pettitte lost twice to the
Indians in the 1997 division series, which will surely be on his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of the year, every win is sweet and every loss is
tough,'' Pettitte said. ``This is for all the marbles and it's to
go into the World Series, so much more intensity and so much more
fire in the game and stuff. It's tough on you when you lose them
and it's definitely a lot sweeter when you're winning them.''
</P>
<P>
   What made Pettitte so dominant against the Rangers was a sneaky
fastball and an ability to nick the corners with his off-speed
pitches, and Pettitte said that he would pitch the Indians the same
way. Colon, who struck out 10 in an 11-0 victory over the Yankees
on June 21, also won the decisive Game 4 of the division series
over Boston. For a few innings, Colon admitted he was ``scared''
against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense that,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said.
``And if he was scared in Boston, I hope he's scared to death
tomorrow night because he threw the ball very, very well and was
very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus shifts to Game 3 on Friday and the Yankees hope they
do something special that makes the focus shift away from
Knoblauch's gaffe. The glare remained on Knoblauch on Thursday, a
day when most Yankees found it necessary to be at the park. They
opened the clubhouse doors and went back to work, which is really
all they could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it deflated us,'' said Shane Spencer. ``It might
have even woke us up.''

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ The abandonment of nudity in fashion, no matter
how fleeting it may be, has sent designers on a quest for other
kinds of titillation. They have found it in new fabrics and in
fresh ways of manipulating them.
</P>
<P>
   That is the course taken by Jil Sander and Miuccia Prada, two of
the most provocative designers working today. They display an
unending fascination with materials, changing their surfaces and
draping and cutting them in ways that alter the proportions of the
garments. Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, too, place an
emphasis on the finish of fabrics, trying in many cases to make old
ideas fresh again.
</P>
<P>
   What fashion has given up in favor of this focus on fabric is
the flesh show that typified runway presentations in the early
1990s. Part of the catalyst for the drift into those easy jollies
was the avalanche of interest in fashion from television.
</P>
<P>
   But most designers no longer feel the need to play to the
camera. They have got used to seeing themselves and their work on
E! Entertainment Television and VH1. And viewers have become ever
more sophisticated about style. Even if they never buy a $600 nylon
satchel, they can still rattle off the name Prada as easily as
``McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   And so designers like Ms. Sander and Ms. Prada have won the
freedom to turn their attention to design details that may not read
on television, assured that there will nonetheless be a
small-screen clamor to show what they put on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberties of discipline'' is a phrase Ms. Sander used in
her program notes. It describes aptly a lifetime of work that has
brought her to the point where she is free to present avant-garde
ideas, offer them at breathtaking prices and still make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   In the taut collection she presented Thursday, she seduced by
invoking lightness, sensuality and playfulness, with her
futuristic, imaginative brain in full view.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded her viewers what modern clothes mean now and what
realistically they might mean in the future, creating garments that
were light, bright and demanding in design but easy on the wearer.
</P>
<P>
   In black-and-white net Jacquards, she layered fabrics one upon
another to give the illusion of three dimensions in sporty anoraks
with hoods and careful, straight white trousers of pressed cotton.
She cut an otherwise simple T-shirt with unfinished but precise
hems and a thin flange of fabric running down either side.
Geometric seams created a sunburst effect on the front of a
sleeveless top. Often she showed languid skirts with pointed,
asymmetric hems dipping a few inches in back.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting luxury without the knee-jerk bells and whistles _
shiny accessories, lush fabrics and explosive colors _ is not easy.
Ms. Sander pulled it off convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Sander's method is to be controlled and austere, Ms.
Prada is far more frenzied, hitting viewers with startling ideas _
some good, others less so.
</P>
<P>
   Her use of smooth silver-blue paper fabric was interesting
enough, but then she went further, sculpturing it into a feminine
shirred slipover paired with a skirt enlivened with mirrors the
size of compacts. The effect was not clownish. Instead, the skirts
and leather coat that Ms. Prada ornamented this way were quite
pleasing. It was a daring concept by an extreme designer, at a time
when many others have been doing penny-size mirrors inspired by
India.
</P>
<P>
   Romanced by origami, Ms. Prada decorated pleated skirts with
vertical rows of looped fabric or box ruffles. She created a
three-dimensional effect around hems with origami-like flowers set
into cutouts. Hemp with a Jacquard finish was transformed into boxy
jeanlike jackets and structured pleated skirts. Gauze, felted to
appear rumpled and innocent, was cut into tunic tops and empire
dresses, a few of which showed the breasts through a veil of
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   If a dress can be a good luck charm, Ms. Prada created just such
a look, placing mirrors and appliques of tiny origami-like folds of
leather around the hips, or down the front, of gauze dresses and
skirts. The effect resembled the many shiny and leather amulets
worn by both Gypsies and traditional West African tribe members.
One can never have too many defenses against evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The burning accessory question in fashion is where to put what
used to be called the handbag. Bags, ubiquitous on Milan runways,
are now turning up everywhere but in the hand. Ms. Prada put hers
on models' backs, wrists, hips and ankles. At Trussardi, most were
strapped high across the derriere.
</P>
<P>
   Trussardi's strength is its bags, but the house also makes the
kind of flawless clothing one expects from Italian factories.
Nicola Trussardi brought a refined tailoring to interesting
techno-fabrics like neoprene, used in zippered, aerodynamic jackets
and matching jams. The experimental fabrics are the right idea, but
there's a note of the absurd in a collection full of foamy
synthetic shorts and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how synthetic fabrics have come to denote,
simultaneously, both luxury and hipness. Rifat Ozbek, the
Anglo-Turkish designer, used athletic-inspired mesh synthetics in
many of the street-sweeping dresses and under-slips in his
still-life presentation, an ode to New York street life.
</P>
<P>
   Ozbek, who has shown in New York for three seasons, said he
decided to forgo a runway presentation this month to get ready for
the earlier February show dates for fall 1999 in America. Before
moving to New York, he had shown in Paris for several years. He was
in Milan because his collection is manufactured here by Aeffe.
</P>
<P>
   Let there be no mistake about how luxurious Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's
synthetic-looking fabrics are: wonderful laminated linens and
laminated silks, glorious hand-painted silk, hologram fabrics and
stretch Chantilly lace.
</P>
<P>
   Researching and developing fabrics for their steamy scenarios
has become a magnificent obsession for these designers. But this
was not a magnificent collection, though the house can claim
bragging rights to several of the concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The too-hot-to-handle organza trousers, developed from the men's
line shown by Dolce and Gabbana earlier this year, were a cool
surprise. They came with back pockets like cargo pants, had a sexy
fit through the back and flared near the ankles, which were adorned
with zippers. A delectable combination was the red lacquered silk
fitted sheath with a floral silk jacket ablaze with sequined
striations that resembled the jagged relief of a computer printout.
Tantalizing too were the micro-polos that ended under the bosom and
the baby cardigans that did not extend even that far and were worn
over a strapless dress or jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But like weeds in a delightful garden, the seamless long
jackets, lacquered black day or cocktail suits and transparent lace
mermaid gowns that the models kept tripping over, even in their
bare feet, were not up to the rest of the display.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Biagiotti is really too much a traditionalist and too
firmly rooted in her ways to have much to do with newfangled
fabrics. But quite by surprise, she put together a sweet show of
airy, streetwise clothes, more youthful than anything she has
produced in recent years. She owed it all to the sports influence
she allowed into the line and to Ms. Prada, whose slashed skirts of
last season were clearly a reference for the pristine white skirts
and dresses with faggoting down the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Hooded shirts and jackets were whipped out in burnt yellow or
sheer white voile with tangerine flocking. Scuba jackets in linen
and day coats embroidered with green leaves topped pretty
knee-brushing skirts, some delicately pleated and ballooned.
</P>
<P>
   It would stretch credulity to suggest that Ms. Biagiotti can
claim ownership to any benchmark look of 1999, as implied by her
runway history lesson tracing the evolution of fashion's silhouette
from 1900 to the present. But she proved with this show that
there's still some fight left in her.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   If the New York Yankees needed any further incentive to beat the
Cleveland Indians in the American League playoff series and move on
to the World Series, Chuck Knoblauch has given it to them. Only a
victory will allow forgiveness of Knoblauch's blunder that gave the
Indians the winning run on Wednesday night. If the Yankees lose,
Knoblauch will forever be remembered in the same company as Fred
``Bonehead'' Merkle, who failed to touch second base in a critical
game in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is a solid, Texas-raised second baseman who spent his
formative professional years in Minnesota before coming to the
Yankees last spring. Apparently this has given him just enough time
to acquire the New Yorker's legendary appetite for disputation.
When a Cleveland runner was called safe at first base, Knoblauch
stood around arguing with the umpire while the ball rolled away. By
the time Knoblauch had stopped litigating the matter and retrieved
the ball, it was too late to stop the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's teammates were forgiving, including David Cone, who
pitched well in a losing cause. When he was with the New York Mets
eight years ago, Cone suffered a brainlock not unlike Knoblauch's,
arguing a call at first base with the ball in his hand while two
runners crossed the plate. Come to think if it, this could be a
peculiarly local phenomenon. New York, after all, is a city where
people argue over a cab while the cab pulls away with another fare.
That is about what Knoblauch did, in front of 57,128 bystanders.

FOSTER ADJUSTS TO LIFE WITHOUT LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There has been no change in his practice routine,
no change in his attitude and no change in his performance.
</P>
<P>
   But when he arrives at the team hotel tonight in Tucson, things
will no longer be the same for Bruins tailback DeShaun Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine's my roommate on road trips, and this will be my
first time without him,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster won't have fellow tailback Jermaine Lewis on the sideline
Saturday night when the No. 3 Bruins face No.10 Arizona, either.
Lewis is serving an indefinite suspension for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Keith Brown will start in Lewis' absence, but the Bruins
are counting on a major contribution from Foster, the talented true
freshman who gained 185 all-purpose yards last week against
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting better every day,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
``He's learning the offense and understanding defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern with Foster, as with all freshman tailbacks in
hostile environments, is fumbling. Arizona plays an attacking,
physical style and figures to swat and poke at the ball when it's
in Foster's hands.
</P>

   ``We're going to tell DeShaun to be confident, and beg him not

   Unimpressed: Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister has not been
impressed with UCLA quarterback Cade McNown this season.

   Stat of the Week II: USA Today did a midseason calculation of
the top teams based on the Bowl Championship Series formula. If the
season ended today, Ohio State (No. 1) and Nebraska (No. 2) would

<TEXT>
<P>
   The battering of the financial markets left few money managers
unscathed in the third quarter. Just ask the ones whose
hypothetical retirement portfolios have been tracked by The New
York Times for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   All five managers lost money, and they clearly were not alone:
Only 150 of the 6,616 stock funds followed by Lipper Analytical
Services, in Summit, N.J., had positive returns for the three
months; on average, stock funds lost 14.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Bond funds fared much better, with domestic long-term bond
funds returning an average of 1.36 percent through Sept. 30, Lipper
said. But fund portfolios for long-term goals like retirement are
generally built on equities, which historically have returned more
over time than bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   For the five managers, the losses ranged from 9.86 percent for
the ``socially responsible'' portfolio built by Jack A. Brill, a
San Diego investment adviser, to 15.91 percent for Sheldon Jacobs,
who edits The No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jacobs remains in first place over all, with a cumulative
return of 92.91 percent from July 7, 1993, when the contest began.
(Brill is closing in, however, with a cumulative gain of 89.66
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Brill was helped by his small holdings in
bonds _ in the Vanguard GNMA fund, up nearly 3 percent, and Pax
World, which lost just over 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop him from keeping a stock-heavy portfolio.
``I still continue to think that over the long-term a retirement
portfolio should have an asset allocation of 85 percent stocks and
15 percent bonds,'' he said, even though he does not expect market
volatility to end soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is still in for a very rough time over the next
three to six months,'' he said. ``It will probably continue these
up-and-down bounces and generally move without much upward
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He is making just one change, adding Bridgeway Social
Responsibility, a three-year-old large-cap blend fund that has
outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index over the last
year, and dropping Delaware Social Awareness, which returned just
2.9 percent in the last year and was down nearly 16 percent in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The rough quarter provided a vindication of sorts for Harold
Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Evensky lagged
behind the other advisers in the last quarter because his portfolio
was not as concentrated as the others in large domestic stocks, the
best performers until recently. With the collapse of those stocks
in the third quarter, his portfolio took second place, despite its
loss of 12.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah! The benefit of diversification is finally showing
its sweet little head,'' Evensky said. ``Not much, but it's a
start.'' He is making no changes in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   One of his holdings, Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, rose 1.8
percent. It was among just 3 of the 43 funds held by the advisers
that made money in the quarter. (The other two were bond funds.)
The fund aims to neutralize market volatility through a mix of long
and short sales. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the five hypothetical portfolios continued to
lag behind the popular Vanguard Index Trust 500, a portfolio
designed to mimic the performance of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. The Index 500 has returned 157.2 percent since the
contest began, compared with an average of just over 79 percent for
the five advisers.
</P>
<P>
   And only Brill beat the Index 500 in the quarter; his loss of
9.86 percent was slightly better than its decline of 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the five portfolios is tracked each quarter
by Lipper Analytical. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs
and taxes because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The five managers can choose any fund open to new investors.
From the outset, they were asked to pick portfolios that would grow
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dziubinski, editor of Morningstar Fund Investor, finished
in third place for the quarter, with a loss of 15.55 percent. Her
heavy portfolio holdings in value stocks, which tend to hold up
better during market corrections, did not protect her during the
third quarter, when the stocks with the highest price-to-earnings
ratios were not necessarily hurt the most. Value funds,
particularly the smaller ones, were hard-hit.
</P>
<P>
   So she is adding a growth fund _ T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth _
to offset her portfolio's value bias. The manager of the fund
``likes growth,'' she said, ``but he won't pay ridiculous prices
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   To add that fund, Ms. Dziubinski is shaving her holdings in
Third Avenue Value Small Cap and Ivy International.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Kobren, president of the Kobren Insight Group in
Wellesley, Mass., who finished fourth in the quarter, uses only
Fidelity funds in his portfolio. He is concerned, he said, about a
slowing economy and increasing volatility in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he is doubling his position in a bond fund,
Fidelity Spartan Government Income, to 20 percent of the portfolio.
He is reducing his positions in Fidelity International Value and
Fidelity Capital Appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   In last place for the quarter, Jacobs is making several changes
to his portfolio. He is dropping the Mutual Discovery fund for
several reasons: poor performance (it lost more than 19 percent in
the quarter); the announcement by the manager, Michael Price, that
he was leaving, and the fund's doubling in size over the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs is also dropping Hotchkis &AMP; Wiley Small Cap, which lost
nearly 27 percent in the quarter. ``I think small caps will
continue to lag large caps the balance of the year because there
will be greater tax-loss selling among small caps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is adding to his positions in Marsico Focus, bringing it to
15 percent, from 10 percent, and Vanguard Total Stock Market, to 35
percent from 32.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And he is creating a 12.5 percent position in the Vanguard Index
Trust 500. ``This gives my portfolio increased representation in
the large-cap area,'' he said.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The National League Championship Series is far from
locked up, but the San Diego Padres are doing some serious fiddling
with the dead bolt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All along, the Atlanta Braves have said the key to winning the
best-of-seven series was whether they could beat Padres ace Kevin
Brown. Maybe they should try the spare key.
</P>
<P>
   Brown slammed the door on the Braves with still another
masterful postseason pitching performance, tossing a three-hit
shutout to lead the Padres to a 3-0 victory Thursday night at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres own a 2-0 lead in the series and could clinch their
first NL pennant since 1984 in front of the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The series shifts to Qualcomm Stadium for Games 3 and 4, and 5,
if necessary, beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This constitutes new ground for the Braves, who never had
dropped the first two games of a series during their dominant
stretch of postseason play in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Killer B's and Co., the Braves had no luck
unlocking the mystery of Brown, who lowered his ERA to a
microscopic 0.38 this postseason. He has 32 strikeouts and has
allowed just eight hits in 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Tom Glavine allowed only one run, but he pitched
around trouble all night and was no match for Brown, who also was
2-for-4 at the plate and scored an insurance run for the Padres in
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine walked five batters in the second and third innings,
escaping bases-loaded predicaments each time. At one point, he
threw eight consecutive pitches without a strike.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as much a case of Glavine being wild as it was his
refusal to give in to opposing hitters. Four of the walks during
that stretch were issued to Ken Caminiti and Wally Joyner _ the
Nos. 4 and 5 hitters in the Padres' batting order.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the lineup started a two-out rally in the sixth
inning when Glavine finally ran out of ways to escape trouble.
Chris Gomez, Brown and Quilvio Veras hit consecutive singles, with
Gomez scoring on Veras' base hit up the middle to give the Padres a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had runners in scoring position in four of their six
innings against Glavine. It was a laborious night for the Braves
lefthander, who threw 83 pitches in the first four innings and 121
for the game. Glavine allowed six hits and walked six before
turning the game over to reliever John Rocker to start the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown retired nine of the first 11 batters he faced and didn't
allow a hit until Chipper Jones' one-out single in the fourth
inning. He only allowed a pair of harmless singles the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres cushioned their lead against rookie reliever Odalis
Perez in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown got things started with a leadoff single and scored on a
single by Veras, who was 3-for-4 with a double. Veras scored the
Padres' final run on Joyner's infield single with the bases loaded.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Looking back on the previous time Texas A&AMP;M
played Nebraska, the Aggies described the experience as
humiliating, embarrassing, sickening.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hated every second of that game,'' center Seth McKinney
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts your pride when you get slaughtered like we did,''
said tight end Dan Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, the Aggies describe another chance to play the
Cornhuskers as ``fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Little would seem to have changed in the teams since December.
A&AMP;M is ranked 18th, a solid team built around a strong defense and
a skilled but unspectacular offense. Nebraska is No. 2, with all
the usual strengths despite one narrow escape against Oklahoma
State in a Big 12 game.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Aggies get the Cornhuskers in Kyle Field. For
all of the Aggies' much-repeated troubles against top-10 teams _
they have lost all nine games against top-10 opponents this decade
_ they seldom have faced a national power in College Station. The
last visit from such a high-ranked team was 15 years ago, when
Texas was No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest game all of us have seen around here in a
while,'' said Cameron Spikes, a senior offensive lineman from
Bryan. ``It's the biggest one I can think of in A&AMP;M's history.
Having played them once before and playing them at our house will
be a big plus for us. It's just fun. We have the biggest
opportunity right in front of us to beat one of the best teams in
college football for the past 10, 20 years. If you can't get
excited to play this type of game, you shouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement has not been a problem. For other programs, a bowl
trip is unique. A conference-championship game, a relatively new
addition to college football, would be a novelty for most programs.
But for A&AMP;M, getting a top-ranked team in Kyle Field brought
feelings rare even with the assorted bowl and championship games
the Aggies have played in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking more forward to this game than if it was just some
other team coming in here this week,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said
Tuesday. ``The day-to-day preparation will be fun, the meeting with
the coaches will be fun, and I think our practices will fly by this
week. Playing this type of game is really what it's all about. I've
got more friends and cousins coming out of the woodwork wanting to
see the game this week. It intensifies everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is most striking because it represents such a
turnaround from the A&AMP;M attitude the previous time the Aggies met
Nebraska. The Cornhuskers rolled to a 54-15 win. They led 37-3 by
halftime and didn't need even that long to put away the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caught them last year when they were smelling the national
championship,'' Slocum said. ``They had lost the year before in the
conference-championship game. Their coach (Tom Osborne) was going
to retire. They had everything going their direction, along with
being a very talented football team. They were a good football team
hitting on all cylinders when we played them. We got off to a bad
start and really never made a contest out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say we were in awe or intimidated, but the
game was pretty much over before it started.''
</P>
<P>
   But his players demurred. It was instantly over, they conceded,
but they had to admit the reasons their coach did not want to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little bit in awe,'' A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown
said. ``That was the first time we played a team like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into that game against a team used to playing a game
of that magnitude,'' A&AMP;M running back Dante Hall said. ``It was new
to us playing that type of team and a championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies insist the experience changed them. Hurt at
first, they said they were hardened and will be different when
Nebraska sees them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that happened to us, we were embarrassed,'' Campbell
said. ``We came in, and we worked. We recognized what they did to
us, and that's what we want to do to people. Ever since that time,
we've tried to practice at the level we think they've been working
at. And I think our work level is a lot better than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Spikes, ``All the guys thought we could play with them, and
we prepared well. We were ready to go. But out there in the first
quarter, we were wide-eyed. `That's Nebraska and this is us in the
Big 12 championship.' We kind of took the first quarter off, and it
showed. With the four wins under us and the way we played Florida
State, we have the confidence knowing what it takes to play the
better teams in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said evidence could be found in the Aggies' subsequent
games. A&AMP;M led UCLA and Florida State at halftime. And though the
Aggies could not hang on to win either game, they were far more
competitive than against Nebraska. And neither was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys competed in the second half and some of the
aura of their team may have wore off a little bit,'' said Slocum,
who is 50-5-1 at home in his 10 seasons as A&AMP;M coach. ``Then, we
played a good UCLA team and I didn't see any of that. I didn't see
any of that when we played Florida State. I think maybe that
(playing Nebraska in the Big 12 title game) helped us grow a little
bit. Since that time, we have played several good teams, and I
think we'll be a little more relaxed going into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest difference could be that A&AMP;M will be at home.
Because of the renovations to Kyle Field, capacity will be only
about 58,000, more than 20,000 off the Kyle Field record.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies insist the smaller crowd will still be a huge
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us feel 100 percent better playing at Kyle Field than
somewhere else,'' Spikes said. ``Everybody's cheering for you
except for the 3,500 Nebraska fans. Everybody is on your side, and
everybody wants you to win. This crowd will be so intense and so
lit up.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CLEVELAND _ Chuck Knoblauch spent Thursday morning watching replays
of the costly mistake that seems to have turned an entire city
against him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later in the day, he did the only thing he could: apologize and
take full responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of possibly holding a 2-0 lead in the American League
Championship Series, the New York Yankees enter tonight's Game 3 at
Jacobs Field tied 1-1 with Cleveland following the costliest goof
of Knoblauch's eight-year career.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that one memorable play can define a career.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Bill Buckner is doomed to infamy for letting a grounder
go through his legs in the 1986 World Series. If the Yankees go on
to lose the ALCS to Cleveland, the image of Knoblauch _ frozen at
first base, arguing, with the ball lying a few feet away while the
lead run scored _ will forever be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up. I screwed up the play, and I feel terrible about
that,'' Knoblauch, the Yankees' normally dependable second baseman
and Houston native, said Thursday. ``I should have gone after the
ball, regardless of what the outcome of the umpire's call was. I
basically screwed up the play and feel bad. I need to apologize to
my teammates and my manager, the Yankees and all the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's teammates were more than willing to forgive and
forget. But as he has begun to learn in his brief time in the Big
Apple, fans and the media aren't as charitable.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers rarely show mercy _ even to their own.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-year playing career in Minnesota left Knoblauch
unprepared for the attention he has received following Wednesday's
game-turning mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly portrayed as a villain, he was loudly booed when he
stepped to the plate in bottom of the 12th inning. It didn't get
any better Thursday. Among the headlines in the New York tabloids:
``Brainlauch,'' ``Blockhead,'' ``Blauchhead,'' and ``Cryin'
Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the replays over and over in his hotel room,
Knoblauch said he understands the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing it from their perspective, they were booing me for
screwing up the play,'' said Knoblauch, acquired by the Yankees
last February from the Twins. ``You can't fault them for that, and
they're going to react to what they see. When you screw up a play
and it costs us the game, that's the kind of treatment you're going
to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the play could not have been worse for Knoblauch,
who has failed to live up to the high expectations surrounding his
trade. He encountered bouts of throwing lapses in 1998 and did not
hit as he had in previous years, finishing with a career-low .265
average.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. In his Rookie of the Year 1991
season, Knoblauch was part of making someone else the goat.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 7 of that year's World Series against Atlanta, Knoblauch
and Twins shortstop Greg Gagne tricked Braves baserunner Lonnie
Smith, causing Smith to hesitate near second base on teammate Terry
Pendleton's long double in the eighth inning of a scoreless game.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the infielders' deception, Smith had to stop at third
base. The Braves failed to get him home, and the Twins won the
World Series with a 10-inning, 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cleveland scored the go-ahead run in the 12th
inning when Knoblauch, covering first base on a sacrifice bunt,
didn't chase the ball after Tino Martinez's throw hit Travis Fryman
and bounced about 30 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of retrieving the ball, Knoblauch began complaining that
Fryman had interfered with the throw by running out of the runner's
lane.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Buckner's infamous play, Knoblauch said he doesn't
believe The Play is what people will remember him for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never play another game, this is what I'll be remembered
for,'' Knoblauch said. ``But hopefully, we can wipe that out
(tonight). Hopefully, I'll have a long career in New York with a
lot of good times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees held an optional workout Thursday afternoon in
chilly drizzle at Jacobs Field. Few players attended the workout,
but Knoblauch felt compelled to address the national media.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be good times and bad times, and you've got to face
the facts one way or the other,'' he said. ``That's the type of guy
I'm trying to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether from his teammates or the Indians, both sides understood
what Knoblauch was going through.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland general manager John Hart, who lost out in the bidding
war for Knoblauch during the offseason, said his first season in
New York has done nothing to change a favorable impression.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing with New York, Knoblauch had expressed interest
in playing for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't pay the price. It wasn't out of lack of love. We
thought Chuck Knoblauch would have been a good fit in Cleveland,''
Hart said. ``He's always impressed me as a down-and-dirty player
with talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said, ``He made a mistake. He
overreacted to the umpire and underreacted to the ball. But you
can't do anything about yesterday. You've got to move on. The only
thing you can do is learn from it. That's something you hope only
happens once in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the harsh treatment in the press, Indians manager Mike
Hargrove had a solution for Knoblauch: ``If he wants to come play
for us, he's more than welcome.''

 &HT;    Bush brushes off jabs MacKay throws during Florida debate
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Waving a copy of legislation allowing school
prayer, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay demanded to know during a statewide
television debate Thursday night whether Jeb Bush would veto it.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who said he had ``no intention of acting like a southern
gentleman,'' also took jabs at Bush about his support of school
vouchers, his opposition to abortion rights, his business career,
his campaign contributions and his lack of government experience.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Bush, the frontrunner in the campaign for
governor, simply shrugged off MacKay's attacks. When handed a copy
of the prayer legislation, Bush just chuckled and said
dismissively, ``Wow, good.'' Bush also refused to directly answer
the question, saying only that he would give any such legislation
careful thought.
</P>
<P>
   When the hourlong debate ended, MacKay said he hoped that Bush
felt the sting of MacKay's undaunting attack on his political
record. For his part, Bush said with a laugh, ``My mother has been
more mean to me than he was tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay stayed the aggressor throughout the debate, which aired
opposite the NBC ratings hit Friends. MacKay's goal Thursday night
was to highlight the issues he believes will turn voters against
Bush. MacKay, despite stumbling during his opening statement and
often appearing ill-at-ease, stuck to his script.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who seemed smooth and comfortable during the debate, was
determined not to get embroiled in a shouting match. He stuck to
his favorite themes about leadership with vision and bringing new
ideas to government. He rarely challenged MacKay directly but when
he did, he attempted to portray MacKay as out of touch with average
Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   The format, questions from studio audiences in four cities, did
not allow for follow-up questions or any real give-and-take between
the two candidates. MacKay wore glasses and some observers said
that MacKay, 65, appeared much older on television than the
45-year-old Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Several times MacKay responded to questions from the audience by
asking about campaign contributions Bush has received from oil
companies. MacKay demanded to know what the oil companies have been
promised by Bush. MacKay suggested that Bush might allow offshore
oil drilling along the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes offshore oil drilling and said that voters do not
need to worry about his contributions from oil or other interest
because ``my principles are rock solid.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay told viewers, ``You have seen a clear choice here. A
choice between someone who has proven experience.'' And he warned
that Bush is ``someone who is very articulate but whose business
record raises more questions,'' about his ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered by saying MacKay may have more government
experience but he has put it to little use. ``The current
administration has had eight years to make things happen,'' he
said. ``Leadership is not about how many years you have in
government. It's about vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush came into the debate strengthened by poll numbers that his
campaign believes make it nearly impossible for MacKay to defeat
him in November. Bush's advisers expected MacKay to lash out at
Bush during the debate but were confident that no matter what
happened, as long as Bush did not make a major blunder, the debate
would have little impact on the outcome of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Not only behind in the polls but well behind in campaign
advertising dollars as well, MacKay wanted to use the debate to
stimulate excite his core base of support and take some of the
luster off Bush. By generating excitement about this debate, MacKay
hopes he can build momentum leading into the next two debates.
</P>
<P>
   A similar strategy worked for Gov. Lawton Chiles four years ago,
when by the third and final debate, Chiles sent Bush reeling and
won the election by 62,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is far from over,'' said Frank Greer, MacKay's media
adviser. ``Lawton Chiles was behind in the polls four years ago and
if MacKay does well in the next three debates we'll turn this thing
around. A lot of people are just now starting to focus on the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the debate, both Bush and MacKay came separately to
the television studio to study the position of the podiums, the
cameras and lights and to discuss strategy with media advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's media adviser, Mike Murphy, complained that the podiums
were too close together. At his insistence, the podiums were moved
another 15 inches apart. MacKay's adviser, Greer, had no concerns
about the set.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, nursing a bronchial infection, arrived in Orlando just
before noon with his wife, Columba. MacKay arrived in Orlando with
his wife, Ann, about an hour earlier and went directly to the
studio.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Bush attended a post-debate rally with
hundreds of supporters at the downtown Marriott, which Bush had
made his headquarters hotel.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay returned to the Radisson where he had a conference call
with hundreds of supporters attending debate parties in 100
locations around the state, including one at the home of state Rep.
Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and MacKay confront each other again on Tuesday when they
will participate in a statewide radio debate that will be aired at
11 a.m. from Orlando. Their final climatic debate will be a
statewide television debate on Oct. 20 broadcast at 7 p.m. on NBC
stations. That debate will be moderated by Meet the Press host Tim
Russert.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's debate will air three times on the Sunshine
Network: 7 a.m. Sunday and Monday, and 5 p.m. Tuesday.

PUBLIC LIVES: JUDITH KAYE, TIM ZAGAT, PAMELA HARRIMAN

   A View of Legs Beneath the Robes
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ It is, Chief Judge JUDITH KAYE declared with the
deliberateness one might find in an on-the-one-hand,
on-the-other-hand ruling, ``not your typical, everyday judicial
photograph.'' She also called it ``striking'' and ``not the
photograph I'm going to choose for the courtroom when I leave the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a full-color Annie Leibovitz photograph of Judge Kaye,
seated at the bench in the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
court, in Albany. It fills two pages in the November issue of
Vanity Fair in an article about 200 women the magazine calls
``legends, leaders and trailblazers.'' Among them are two justices
of the U.S. Supreme Court, SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR and RUTH BADER
GINSBURG.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that the photograph showed a lot of leg,
Judge Kaye said, ``That was not deliberate.'' She said her only
goal in posing for Miss Leibovitz had been ``to make the court more
human.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to the court on a day when the court was not in
session,'' the judge said, ``but we were having a press conference
on court reorganization. I took center stage at the press
conference, but as soon as she wandered out, everyone started
paying attention to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-Star Takeout For a Special Client
</P>
<P>
   Normally the pristine, pricey restaurant JeanGeorges doesn't do
takeout. But Thursday, a squadron of waiters and chefs carried
lunch for 40 across Columbus Circle to the office of the Zagat
restaurant guides.
</P>
<P>
   TIM ZAGAT, who publishes the guides and paid for the meal, said
that ordering in was a longstanding tradition at deadline time: the
1999 New York City guide is to be published next Friday.
``Sometimes you find out that Bouley's food didn't travel very
well,'' Zagat said. ``That was last year. He was way downtown. By
the time the stuff got here, it was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagat had no complaints about the food JEANGEORGES VONGERICHTEN
sent over, which included crab salad with mango, cumin crisps and
grainy mustard; loin of lamb dusted with black trumpet mushrooms,
and tarte Tatin.
</P>
<P>
   And the bill? ``I haven't seen it yet,'' Zagat said. The
estimate from Vongerichten was $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not including tip.

<P>
   Scoffs and Sarcasm For Harriman Film
</P>
<P>
   If Pamela Harriman were alive, she might be miffed.
</P>
<P>
   At an invitation-only screening of the made-for-cable film
``Life of the Party: The Pamela Harriman Story'' (based on
Christopher Ogden's biography of the late U.S. ambassador to France
and longtime benefactor of the Democratic Party) the audience
laughed at the lines spoken by the actress playing the woman once
colloquially known as one of the world's greatest courtesans.
</P>
<P>
   First the Ogden character (played by John O'Hurley, who played
J. Peterman on ``Seinfeld'') asks, ``Is it true that Averell left
you $145 million?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harriman _ played with hair-sprayed, lusty blondness by
ANN-MARGRET _ responds, ``Frankly, I didn't focus on that.'' The
audience guffawed.
</P>
<P>
   RICK FRIEDBERG _ who is married to the film's producer, FRANCINE
LEFRAK _ played a federal judge. At the screening, he whispered
ominously to his seatmate, ``What you can't necessarily attain in
politics you can find in film.'' (For several years Friedberg had
the title of, no kidding, director of advance at City Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   After the screening, the 400 guests drank white wine and
reminisced about Mrs. Harriman, who died last year at 76.
Bandleader PETER DUCHIN, who had his dust-ups with Mrs. Harriman,
sounded somewhat less than gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I profoundly wish the swimming pool scene had been longer,''
Duchin said, referring to the place of Mrs. Harriman's death.
``There should have been more glub-glub-glub.''

A GAME PLAN FROM GIULIANI FOR STADIUM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Yankees soar and stumble in their quest for
the World Series championship, the team's best-known fan continues
to do what he can to insure victory. He provides pitching analyses,
sizes up opponents, even wears a team warm-up jacket to games. You
half expect to see him in the dugout come game time, spitting out
sunflower seeds and gesturing to the center fielder, Bernie
Williams, to shade a little to the left.
</P>
<P>
   So immersed is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in baseball culture that
he has adopted his own version of the no-hitter protocol. (If a
pitcher is in the midst of throwing a no-hitter, his teammates make
no mention of it, for fear of jinxing the feat.) With the fate of
Yankee Stadium now as unclear as any extra-inning ball game, the
mayor and his aides are silent to the point of being glum.
</P>
<P>
   One reason given for keeping quiet is that the team has to
concentrate on winning, as though pesky questions about ball parks
might have caused Wednesday night's game-losing mental lapse by
Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman. Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's
communications director, said, ``Right now, the best thing is for
the Yankees to win the playoffs and then the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But another reason for not discussing the matter is
that it continues to vex a mayor known for having an answer for
everything. How does he reconcile the overwhelming public support
for keeping the Yankees in the Bronx with the team's intimations
that it will leave _ possibly for New Jersey _ when its lease is up
in 2002?
</P>
<P>
   The one proposal that the mayor has floated _ to help finance a
stadium on Manhattan's West Side _ has relegated him to the far end
of the dugout bench. And recent developments suggest that no Fan
Appreciation Night is in his near future.
</P>
<P>
   There was Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer's recent
release of a slick architectural plan to renovate Yankee Stadium.
The mayor dismissed the proposal as rehashed nonsense without
actually having read it, which only ceded the moral high ground to
Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came this week's ruling by Justice Douglas McKeon of state
Supreme Court in the Bronx that criticized the mayor for creating a
charter revision commission with the express mission of coming up
with a ballot proposal that, by law, would block a referendum
question on his Yankee plan. To wit: whether public money should
help finance a Manhattan stadium for the Yankees in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's decision to let the referendum stand _ a decision that
the city's lawyers say is heavy on passion and light on legal merit
_ is being appealed. And Giuliani may be right in arguing that
polls should not dictate policy and that the referendum is a
vote-getting ploy by Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker and
the Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentimental defense of Yankee Stadium that McKeon
included in his ruling reflects the emotional tide that the mayor
finds himself swimming against. All he could do was condemn the
judge as a Democratic hack and Vallone as a political panderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reduce the city's negotiating position at a critical time
with the Yankees,'' Giuliani said Thursday, ``in order to get a
couple of votes in a gubernatorial election _ I really think you
should be ashamed of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   His is such a lonely position that not even his fellow
Republican George Pataki, Vallone's opponent, has offered a
teammate's pat on the back. ``They belong in the Bronx, period,''
the governor said of the Yankees two weeks ago. As for the West
Side site, which involves state land that he controls, the governor
said, ``There are a great many factors that argue strongly against
that site.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ms. Lategano sought common ground with the
governor, saying that Giuliani also wanted the team to stay in the
Bronx, and that no proposal was concrete. ``You have to keep both
options open, the Bronx and the West Side, because what
Steinbrenner has kept open is New Jersey,'' she said, referring to
the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner III.
</P>
<P>
   Such tempered comments stand in contrast to the hoopla with
which the Giuliani administration touted its West Side plan last
spring. The Bronx, it seemed, was the past; Manhattan, the future.
Now, in the postseason, there is a mayor, quite alone and enduring
daily criticism, who is waiting for the games to end so that
negotiations can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a leader, not a follower,'' he said the other day,
sounding like a baseball manager being second-guessed. ``I can see,
like, three steps ahead.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN EXPERT VIEWS THE KNOBLAUCH PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes planning is overrated, and good TV benefits
from serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the former umpire Steve Palermo was the guest of
NBC's Bob Costas in the Yankee Stadium broadcast booth for Game 2
of the American League Championship Series between the New York
Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. Palermo and his wife, Debbie,
were visiting the city, and Palermo is friendly with Costas. ``I
keep his number with me and if there's a chance for a rules
interpretation, I call him,'' Costas said.
</P>
<P>
   Through 11-plus innings, Costas and Joe Morgan handled the
calls, until Travis Fryman's bunt led to a contretemps that called
for an umpire's touch.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo watched the play unfold, then observed as Costas and
Morgan parsed it in numerous replays: Fryman sacrificed, ran inside
the baseline, was plunked in the back by Yankee first baseman Tino
Martinez's throw and advanced to second base as the ball rolled
toward right field and Enrique Wilson scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd seen the replays and I asked, `Do you want to go on?'''
Costas said Thursday. ``He said, `Sure.' He wasn't anxious to
disagree with a colleague, but his intent was to look at the play
and analyze it as an umpire would.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Palermo rendered his verdict: Fryman was guilty of
interference and should have been called out by the home-plate
umpire, Ted Hendry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule calls that one or both feet must be on the line or
inside the 45-foot lane,'' he said. ''If you are astride the line,
you are to be called out. If you're outside the box entirely, then
you ought to be called out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Costas if umpires will not make the call unless the
interference is blatant, he said, ``There's no such thing as
intentional or unintentional interference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you think Fryman should have been out?'' Costas asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Palermo said.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after, Palermo said he was not reluctant to
critique Hendry's noncall, but added that a broadcaster has more
tools, and time, to assess a play while an umpire has only one
quick chance to invoke judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to criticize my colleagues,'' said Palermo, who
spent the 1995 and 1996 seasons analyzing the Yankees part-time for
the MSG Network. ``But hopefully, you can educate people as to
what's going on down on the field. What I said was from up here,
this is how I would have ruled. Ted Hendry doesn't have the view
from above. When you're an umpire, lots of things are exploding in
front of you all at once. It was a difficult call to make. I'm not
shouting, `How can you not make the call?' That sounds so easy.
It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Palermo understood the defense of Hendry, mounted by Jim Evans,
the umpires' crew chief, that Fryman had a right to be in fair
territory when the ball hit him because first base is in fair
territory. ``It's common sense that he has to come into fair
territory,'' Palermo said. But, as he said during the game: ``From
the time he leaves home plate to the time he arrives at first base,
he was entirely inside the line. So you determine he has to be
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was more equivocal than Palermo. Morgan focused his
analysis more on the failure of Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees'
second baseman, to chase the rolling ball rather than stand around
and demand an interference call.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan acknowledged that Fryman ran where he shouldn't have. Had
Martinez's throw hit Fryman when he was out of the running lane,
Morgan said, he should have been called out. But it hit him in fair
territory, as he approached first, a gray area that even Palermo
said the rule book offers little guidance on.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo's cameo role raised the question of why more umpires
have not become announcers. Certainly, there have been articulate
umpires capable of doing the job, but Palermo and the late Ron
Luciano were the only ones to cross over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another side of the game to hear explanations from an
umpire,'' Palermo said. ``You can say things that make fans say, `I
didn't know that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Costas offered another view: ``If you had an umpire on a network
broadcast, ideally he's there as the third man in the booth,
commenting less frequently than the main analyst, not because
umpires don't know baseball, but if you find a former player or
manager, their direct experiences cover more aspects of the game
than an umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Off camera, Costas said, Palermo suggested that one reason
Hendry's strike zone ``seemed portable'' Wednesday was that
pitchers David Cone and Charles Nagy ``throw pitches with
late-breaking action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, an umpire can give up on a pitch the way a batter
can,'' Costas said. ``He wasn't critical of Hendry, he was just
giving insight into something an umpire faces.''

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ACCUSE PAROLE OFFICIAL OF PERJURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A member of the state parole board has been charged
with repeatedly lying when questioned about whether the board gave
preferential treatment to an inmate whose family contributed to
Gov. George Pataki's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal indictment unsealed Thursday, the parole board
member, Sean McSherry of Chester, N.Y., was accused of misleading
investigators and a grand jury looking into the release of a
teen-age gang member serving time for violent felonies who was
freed by the board at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's father is a prominent Korean-American minister
in Queens who enlisted the help of a Pataki aide to win the release
of his son and contributed $1,000 to the Pataki campaign. Others
linked to the minister gave several thousand dollars more to the
campaign, officials involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment lays out the first charges in the investigation
by the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which has placed several
members of the Pataki administration before a grand jury examining
the campaign's fund-raising practices. The inquiry began in January
after the parents of another inmate complained to the authorities
that a volunteer fund-raiser had offered to help their son win
parole in exchange for campaign contributions but had not kept his
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki administration officials have vehemently denied that
anyone received favors from the state government in return for
contributions. On Thursday, Pataki's re-election campaign accused
the U.S. attorney, Zachary Carter, of playing politics with the
case, questioning why the indictment was announced less than a
month before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   McSherry, 46, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn to an eight-count indictment charging
him with perjury, obstruction of justice and making false
statements. He declined to comment, but after the proceeding, his
lawyer, Mark Spund, assailed the indictment as ``totally without
merit,'' and echoed the campaign's criticism of Carter, who was
appointed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a politically motivated indictment prior to
an election, and we look forward to a speedy trial and his
vindication,'' Spund said. Carter declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, the New York City
Council speaker, called the indictment evidence of what he said
were the Pataki administration's troubled ethics. ``By now, Al
D'Amato and George Pataki surely understand that their insatiable
appetite for money inevitably leads to corruption,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   A former assistant district attorney in the Bronx, McSherry was
appointed to the parole board by Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, in
1989 and re-appointed by Cuomo in 1994. He is a member of the
Conservative Party and a friend of the party's leader, Michael
Long, who is a close adviser to Pataki.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McSherry is on a medical leave of absence from the 19-member
parole board. Long said McSherry had been hospitalized for a
``slight breakdown'' caused in part by the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in the case who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said prosecutors were looking into whether McSherry lied
in order to protect more senior officials on the parole board or
elsewhere in the Pataki administration. But prosecutors have
declined to discuss who else is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The gang member, John Kim, was released by a parole board panel
in a 3-0 vote in April 1996 after serving four years of a
4-to-12-year sentence. He had pleaded guilty to a string of violent
robberies in Queens. Although he had a clean record in prison, the
Pataki administration had been tightening its standards for
releasing violent criminals on parole. In 1996, more than 60
percent of the violent felons who qualified for a parole hearing
were denied.
</P>
<P>
   In Kim's case, the prosecutors who had put him behind bars
strongly objected to his release.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's father, Nam Soo Kim, is pastor of the Full Gospel Church
of New York, one of the city's largest Korean-American churches. He
sought the help of a friend, Grace Koh, an adviser to Pataki on
Asian-American affairs, who wrote and called the parole board on
Kim's behalf. Nam Soo Kim has said his contribution was not
connected to his son's parole.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he got help from Yung Soo Yoo, a Korean-American
businessman who had raised money for the Pataki campaign in 1994
and was named by Pataki to his transition committee. Yoo wrote the
parole board saying that he would hire John Kim upon his release,
according to the inmate's father.

UNFORGIVING NEW YORKERS RIP YANKS' KNO-`BLOCKHEAD' 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In German, Knoblauch means: a) garlic; b) someone who
makes incredible mental mistakes at the worst possible times; c) a
person who, having erred, should be pitied; d) the second coming of
Bill Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to the dictionary, is garlic. But for many
New Yorkers, the name Chuck Knoblauch is probably better defined by
the other descriptions, as well as a few others that are not
printable.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is the New York Yankees second baseman who, as anyone
who has turned on a television or seen a tabloid cover in the last
24 hours knows by now, made a monumental mental error Wednesday
night during Game 2 of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   During a disputed play in the 12th inning of a 1-1 game,
Knoblauch did not retrieve the baseball, stubbornly arguing with an
umpire while the Cleveland Indians' Enrique Wilson rounded the
bases to score the run that put Cleveland ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the kind of play that disappointed fans. It was
the kind of play that left jaws dropping, a blunder that seemed
more suited to Charlie Brown _ another Charles tagged with the
nickname ``blockhead.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, New Yorkers took up what their city has raised to
a fine art: piling on the goat of the hour. Some took pity on
Knoblauch, saying that people make mistakes all the time, and that
to vilify him would send a bad message to children. Others, though,
blasted his blunder as unforgivable, saying that he did something
no Little Leaguer would have got wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think it would almost be a reflex by now, so it's
hard to have sympathy'' said Louis Tuchman, a tax lawyer at Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP; Handler, who has attended Little League
games as a parent. ``In the tax world, it's kind of like getting
all your tax extensions, signed and sealed, and not putting it in
the mailbox. Or how about this: it's like doing the work for a
client and not sending out the bill. What are you, nuts?''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch did apologize to his teammates and Yankee fans
Thursday at a news conference, saying that he could understand why
people were so angry at him because ``I screwed up.'' The news
conference was at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, a site where he might
receive a warm, albeit sarcastic, reception for Game 3 on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But actions speak louder than words, and unless Knoblauch
becomes the second coming of Mantle or Ruth and carries the Yankees
to an expected victory in the World Series, his play on the field
figures to be the talk _ or rather, the shout _ of a town that has
been obsessed with this remarkable, record-destroying Yankee team.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers would not have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about New York is supercharged, and in a place
where there's this much tension, there's a greater need for a
catharsis,'' said former Gov. Mario Cuomo, who played semi-pro
baseball before delving into the blood sport of politics. ``Fans go
to ball games to purge themselves of all kinds of emotions. And
booing is very much a part of that experience. So I'm not surprised
at the reaction to Knoblauch.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was pretty vicious, in some arenas. The New York
Post screamed, ``BLOCKHEAD'' and ``CHUCK BRAINLAUCH.'' Newsday
declared, ``Chuck It Up to Stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   At Paragon Sports in lower Manhattan, a salesman who declined to
give his name said that he had sold seven ``Knoblauch'' jerseys
Thursday. Not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you, kidding? No one wants to be near that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sports radio station, WFAN-AM, Knoblauch was not exactly
a fan favorite. Yes, the talk-show hosts tried to be civil, saying
that the Yankees had missed many great scoring opportunities in
Game 2, and that a loss was just a loss for a team that has been by
far the best in baseball this year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet one host, Steve Somers, couldn't resist saying:
``Knoblauch deserves to get spanked. He had more of a presence of
mind to blow a bubble than to retrieve the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Other callers invoked the memory of Bill Buckner, the
much-maligned former first baseman for the Boston Red Sox, who, to
the delight of New York Met fans, lost a routine ground ball
through his legs, giving the Mets a victory in Game 6 of 1986 World
Series. But while Buckner's gaffe was physical, Knoblauch's was
mental _ something that callers found less excusable.
</P>
<P>
   All this invective from New Yorkers did not square well with
Boyd Trolinger, however.
</P>
<P>
   Trolinger was a close friend of Knoblauch's when they played
baseball on the same high school team in Houston: Chuck as a star
shortstop, Boyd as a first baseman. And he said that anyone who
doubted Knoblauch's baseball talents did not know a man who grew up
as the son of a prominent baseball coach, and has lived and
breathed baseball ever since he was a toddler.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't find a baseball player who knows the rules
better,'' said Trolinger, 31, who is now a doctoral student in
Native American history at Texas Tech. ``I never knew Chuck to do
anything to betray his friends or his team. He would never have
done anything consciously to jeopardize the outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a good number of people who have been associated with
competitive baseball seemed to commiserate with Knoblauch, who is
considered one of the best second-basemen in the game, despite a
mediocre season, his first in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gannon Sr., whose namesake son was a member of the Toms
River East team that won the Little League World Series
Championship last month, said that one of the lessons that the
parents imparted to their children was that baseball is a team
sport, and no one play makes or breaks a game.

 LON CLARK, 86, ACTOR AND VOICE ON RADIO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lon Clark, who began his career in radio drama and
went on to a theatrical career on and off-Broadway, died on Friday
at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 86 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Clark made his name as the rich baritone voice of a radio
sleuth, starring from 1943 to 1955 in the popular weekly series
``Nick Carter, Master Detective'' on WOR-Mutual. He also appeared
regularly on such shows as ``The Kate Smith Hour,'' ``The March of
Time,'' ``The Thin Man'' and ``Norman Corwin Presents,'' playing
opposite performers like Orson Welles, Helen Hayes, Fred Allen and
Art Carney.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Frost, Minn., Clark studied at the McPhail School of
Music in Minneapolis, worked in traveling tent shows as an actor
and musician and then spent a season with the Cincinnati Summer
Opera. He first tried his hand at radio drama in Cincinnati, then
moved to New York in the 1940s. In later years he turned to stage
work and at one point took over the role of Jamie from Jason
Robards in the 1956 Broadway production of O'Neill's ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Michelle Trudeau Clark; two sons,
Lon Jr. and Stephen, both of San Francisco; a brother, Gerald, of
Plymouth, Minn.; and a grandson.

DRUG DEAL SCRAPPED BY HMO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Managed-care giant Foundation Health Systems Inc.
has scrapped a controversial plan to give preference to
Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs in exchange for payments of $1 million a
month, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, outlined in a secretive June memo between the two
companies but disclosed at a state hearing on HMO drug practices,
drew strong criticism from legislators and the medical community.
Critics said the proposed arrangement amounted to a kickback for
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the proposed arrangement, Foundation would have
instructed doctors to use Squibb drugs when prescribing medicine
for patients in five categories, with problems ranging from high
cholesterol to bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the drug maker would have paid $1 million per month
to a Foundation subsidiary that manages its pharmaceutical
purchases. The memo stated specifically that the money was not
meant to discount the cost of Squibb's products. Rather, the
payments would have financed an in-house campaign to persuade
doctors to stick with Squibb and other Foundation-approved drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Yukelson, a spokesman for Foundation's largest HMO,
Health Net, said Thursday the deal has been called off, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is, there is no deal,'' Yukelson said. ``What caused
this (proposed arrangement) not to happen was that the two
companies simply could not come to terms on a meaningful
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yukelson claimed media and political pressure played no role,
and the proposal changed significantly from what was detailed in
the June memo.
</P>
<P>
   If the updated proposal had been enacted, he said, physicians
treating members could have prescribed drugs not preferred by
Foundation, although Foundation would have paid for the medicine
only if approved by an appeals group within the company.
</P>
<P>
   Yukelson said his company has not ruled out a similar deal in
the future. ``We do have a very meaningful, ongoing clinical and
financial relationship with Bristol-Myers Squibb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legislators took some credit Thursday for getting the
deal scrapped. Michael Shapiro, director of the state Senate
Committee on Insurance and an aide to Sen. Herschel Rosenthal,
D-Van Nuys, said he hopes for greater scrutiny from state
regulators so legislators ``won't have to be in the press to
embarrass companies to step away'' from future deals.
</P>
<P>
   In separate letters, Rosenthal and Assemblywoman Liz Figueroa,
D-Fremont, challenged the state Department of Corporations, which
oversees prepaid health plans, to investigate the Foundation-Squibb
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no clearer example of a deal in which the
economic incentives that benefit individual companies work to the
express disadvantage of patients,'' Figueroa wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Squibb officials could not be reached Thursday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, Foundation shares sank as much as 23 percent
Thursday on warnings from the company that its third-quarter
earnings will be hurt by higher-than-expected medical costs.
Foundation shares closed at $7, down $1.875.

FERRARO MAY HAVE LIMITED ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the first puck drops for the Kings on
Saturday night in Edmonton, there's a strong possibility a healthy
Ray Ferraro will be watching in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   As wrenching as that may seem for a 34-year-old center with two
40-goal NHL seasons on his resume, Ferraro sounds as if he's come
to terms with the limited role he is expected to have with the
Kings this year.
</P>
<P>
   This has not always been the case. Coach Larry Robinson said
Thursday that Ferraro, a career 333-goal scorer, has more readily
accepted the utility role than he might have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with your family and your age
and not wanting to be uprooted and enjoying your surroundings and
enjoying the people you play with,'' Robinson said following a
Forum practice at which Ferraro skated on a line with Steve McKenna
and Roman Vopat, who have scored 10 NHL goals between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to be as fair as we can with Ray and up-front
about what his status is and what we expect from him. That's all we
can do. Ray has come in here with a great attitude. He played well
in the exhibition games and in practices he's been working his butt
off. That's all you can expect of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said: ``I told (general manager Dave Taylor) last week
my No.1 priority was to stay here. I don't want to go anywhere. I
like the guys, I like the staff, and I want to be part of this
team. If I have to be patient to get my chance to play, then I just
have to make sure I'm ready when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was left unprotected in Monday's NHL waiver draft, and
went unclaimed. Given his age, his salary ($1.75 million) and the
fact that he was riddled with knee problems last season, his
availability in the draft and the lack of interest were not
surprising, even to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me there are some serious questions of whether I can
play anymore,'' Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping to prove he can. But if he ends up not playing
much, there's a strong possibility Ferraro will end his 15-year
career after this season. A career in broadcasting appears to await
Ferraro, who has previously done work for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is, I just love sports, not just hockey,''
Ferraro said. ``I'm one of those guys who can remember somewhat
needless sports drivel and I like to talk about the game. So it's
not really a stretch for me to get in front of the camera. I'm not
nervous. That's half the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg update: Time is almost up for the Kings to sign Aki Berg.
The 21-year-old defenseman, playing in his native Finland because
of a contract dispute, must sign before the Kings open the season
Saturday or he will be lost for the year. After the season starts,
he'd have to clear waivers before rejoining the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are believed to have offered Berg a one-year contract
for $625,000. Berg made $425,000 in base salary last year, but he
and his agent, Larry Kelly, believe he should be paid at least the
$825,000 he earned when factoring in the $1 million signing bonus
he received from the Kings after they drafted him in 1995.

JOSEPH MERLINO, 76, FORMER POLITICAL POWER IN N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIC PACE  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph P. Merlino, a rough-hewn Democrat who was a powerful
figure in New Jersey politics for years, serving two terms as state
Senate president and helping enact key legislation, died Oct. 7 at
the Forrestal Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Princeton, N.J.,
where he had been for a week. He was 76 and a lifelong resident of
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease and diabetes, said his daughter,
Kate Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, he was affiliated with the law firm of
Joseph Mooney in Trenton. The capital city, long a Democratic
stronghold, was his political power base during his 14 years as a
state legislator.
</P>
<P>
   Those years began in 1968, with two terms in the state Assembly,
and then 10 years in the state Senate, where he rose to be
president from 1978 to 1981. He won that post after two years of
pushing the programs of Gov. Brendan Byrne, a fellow Democrat.
Byrne was an old friend and political ally who was known to sit in
the Merlino kitchen and eat fried hot peppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was a natural-born leader,'' Byrne, who was governor from
1974 to 1982, said in an interview Thursday. ``He was forceful and
committed, one of the last of the true liberals.'' Byrne said
Merlino played a critically important role ``at a time when New
Jersey had to do a lot of things like preserve the Pinelands and
reform the tax system,'' an era of ``major policy decisions which
had to be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   As Senate president, Merlino sponsored the Pinelands Protection
Act, which was enacted in 1979, backing up a building moratorium in
New Jersey's Pinelands that Byrne had already imposed. The act put
the New Jersey authorities in charge of protecting almost 20
percent of the state's land area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and I shared an emotional commitment to the Pinelands,''
Byrne said, ``but we had a lot of people against us, and it wasn't
an issue that immediately caught the public fancy.'' The act
received its final legislative approval in the state Assembly by
48-16. Byrne, when asked how he and Merlino prevailed on the issue,
said crisply, ``Leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But the burly, cigar-loving Merlino was modest about his skills.
``I was the best D student to graduate from Trenton High School,''
he claimed in a widely quoted interview two decades ago. ``Even my
guidance counselor advised me to get a job with the WPA.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Byrne said that while Merlino was Senate
president, ``he was the gatekeeper for a lot of legislation _ it
didn't go anywhere unless he wanted it to.'' More than a hundred
pieces of legislation that were considered ``his bills'' were
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said ``a turning point in New Jersey history'' came in
1976 with the passage of the state's graduated income tax after
effective backing from Merlino, who Byrne said was ``a pretty
subtle arm-twister.'' Other legislation that Merlino helped get
passed included a program to aid elderly people in paying for
prescription medications.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Trenton, he was the son of Pasquale Merlino and the
former Margarita Fuccello. He served in the Army, mainly in the
Mediterranean area, and received a bachelor's degree in 1948 from
Seton Hall and his law degree in 1951 from Fordham.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1989, he was the senior partner in the Trenton law
firm of Merlino, Rottkamp &AMP; Flacks and its predecessors. In 1989,
he retired from the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Among other posts that he held over the years were assistant
prosecutor for Mercer County, N.J., which includes Trenton, and
Trenton city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he came in fourth in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary, which was won by Rep. Jim Florio. In 1982, Merlino ran for
Congress in the new 4th District in and around Trenton, but he
suffered a surprise defeat by the 29-year-old freshman Republican
incumbent, Christopher Smith.
</P>
<P>
   During that campaign, the story goes, an overconfident Merlino
was talking to reporters when Smith tried to interject a comment.
``Quiet, kid,'' Merlino said, ``I'm talking to the press. When I
get to Washington, look me up. I may give you a job as a page.''
</P>
<P>
   He was on the boards of the Greater Trenton Symphony Orchestra
and the New Jersey State Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Molly
McGoogan; three daughters, Claire Merlino of Brooklyn and Nell
Merlino and Kate Merlino, both of Manhattan; two sons, Jim, of
Santa Monica, Calif., and Joe, of Manhattan; a sister, Connie
Degnan of Palm Beach, Fla., and two stepgrandchildren.

LYMAN FORD, 89, WHO HEADED A PRECURSOR TO UNITED WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.C., N.Y., Ill., Mo.)  (bl) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lyman Ford, who in the 1960s was president of what became the
United Way of America and who pushed the old Community Chests to
become a financing channel for President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on
poverty, died Oct. 5 of pneumonia at a hospice in Hillsborough,
N.C., United Way of America said. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   When the war on poverty began in late 1964, its leader, Sargent
Shriver, rushed to get federal funds out to about 1,000 hastily
created community action agencies. In many cities Ford pressed the
local Community Chests to step forward and receive the funds,
arguing that since they already had legal status as public
charities and networks of social service agencies under their
umbrella, they could best handle the money.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, which infuriated some advocates for the poor who
wanted organizations outside the local power structures to control
the funds, set the stage for the rapid growth of government funds
to social service charities. Today, nonprofit social service
agencies rely on government money for more than half of their

who studies nonprofit agencies.

   During the decade that Ford headed what was then called United
Community Funds and Councils of America, he dealt with the mergers
in many cities of competing social service charity fund drives, an
efficiency move urged by corporate leaders who wanted to simplify
payroll giving into a single unified drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some communities it was a very positive merger and in
others it was a shotgun wedding,'' recalled Dick Aft, a protege of
Ford who is now president of the United Way and Community Chest of
Greater Cincinnati. ``But everywhere Lyman worked with tact and
diplomacy to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also resisted efforts to expand United Way into financing
the arts and other fields, sticking close to the core interest in
helping children, troubled people and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Lyman Sedgwick Ford was born in Baldwinsville, N.Y., the son of
a minister. He graduated from Denison University and earned a
master's degree at Ohio State University, which also gave him an
honorary doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, he started out as publicity director for the Community
Chest in Columbus, Ohio. He later headed the Community Chests in
Evanston, Ill., and Kansas City, Mo., and then joined the Community
Chest national staff in 1942. He became associate executive
director in 1950 and executive director in 1960, retiring in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was a trustee of Denison and served on the boards of the
National Charities Information Bureau, the National Council on
Social Work Education and the National Conference of Lawyers and
Social Workers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Nist Ford; a
daughter, Barbara Ford Thelen of Denver; a son, James Lyman Ford of
Mequon, Wis.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

FEDERAL JUDGE DEALS MICROSOFT A SETBACK ON ANTITRUST LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge dealt Microsoft Corp. a setback in its pretrial
antitrust suit preparations Thursday by denying the company access
to the interview tapes and transcripts for a new book written by
two business school professors.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its defense, Microsoft has sought the research
materials for an unpublished book, ``Competing on Internet Time:
Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' by Michael
Cusumano, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School, and David Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The book is based largely on interviews with executives of
Netscape Communications Corp., the early leader in the market for
software to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's tactics in the browser market are the main focus of
the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has already obtained a copy of the unpublished
manuscript of the book. But it wants the interview tapes and
transcripts to try to establish that Netscape's travails were the
result of Netscape's missteps and Microsoft's excellence rather
than any predatory practices by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard Stearns of the U.S. District Court in Boston said
that Microsoft had failed to demonstrate that it could not get the
information it sought elsewhere. In its pretrial preparations,
Microsoft has deposed seven of the 44 Netscape executives
interviewed by the authors.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the company was considering whether
to appeal the judge's ruling.

TWO-TIME SURVIVOR HAS NO USE FOR SELF-PITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, a story swept like a bad fire through
the breast cancer community:
</P>
<P>
   Amy Langer, the vivacious and popular executive director of the
National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations and herself a
breast cancer survivor, was in a car accident and had lost her
legs. She had pulled her car over to the side of a road and another
car had crashed into her, severing both legs at the knees. Her
husband and 4-year-old child were with her.
</P>
<P>
   All true. But before we get to the subject at hand _ a project
Ms. Langer would rather discuss than her accident _ a few more
stories about Amy Langer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langer's first words to her husband as she awoke from
surgery were: ``Oh, my God, Charlie! Kindergarten applications!
We've got to get on this immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   While still hospitalized, Ms. Langer had a fax machine
installed, because it was August, when her organization completes
plans for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, October.
</P>
<P>
   She is not crazy about people who plant themselves in her path
and do the misty-eyed, urgent, ``But how are you _ really?'' thing,
probably because Amy Langer in a wheelchair has more energy than
most New Yorkers do on their feet: She makes three or four trips to
Washington a month. She oversees a $4 million annual budget. But
she doesn't shy away from references to what she calls ``my
disability'' either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complicated having prosthetic legs built if you need
knee joints, but it's also fascinating,'' Ms. Langer, 44, says at
her Upper East Side brownstone, where she is wearing a sweater and
a full, long skirt that is disturbingly limp below the knees.
``I'll be taller. That's one of the good things about this. I have
others. Never ruining your shoes in the rain, never having to see
the subway again.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after giving her cup of coffee to a photographer who has
offered to carry it up the stairs, ``The thing about this
disability, it makes coasters of all my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langer's preferred subject: the Save the Day campaign, next
Friday, to raise money for mammograms for underserved women.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in decades, deaths from breast cancer are
going down for white women and Hispanic women _ 1.9 percent a year
for the last few years,'' Ms. Langer says. ``But the death rate for
black and Asian women is rising. That has to do with income. A poor
woman can't get the best care. That's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Langer was not a poor woman when she was diagnosed with
breast cancer at 30, back in 1984. A graduate of Yale with an
M.B.A. from Harvard, she was a senior vice president at Lehman
Brothers. She earned so much money that she is a little embarrassed
to reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many zeros,'' Ms. Langer says. ``Many.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not worry about her health. Ms. Langer's mother had died
of ovarian cancer when Ms. Langer was 20, but it was not known then
that breast and ovarian cancer are sometimes genetically linked.
Still, as Ms. Langer had cystic, lumpy breasts and there was cancer
in her family, her doctor ordered a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langer enacts the scene: fast-track woman, waiting. ``I go
to the office,'' Ms. Langer says, ``and sit with my papers spread
all over every seat, underlining things with my yellow marker.
`Squeeeek, squeeeek, squeeeek.' I have the test done and go back to
my papers. `Squeeeek, squeeeek, squeeeek.' Then it was _ '' here
Ms. Langer mimes a grim nurse with a beckoning finger _ ```You.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langer did not hide the fact that she had cancer. She left
copies of articles about breast cancer on her desk, and one
colleague, prompted to have a mammogram, found a cancerous lump.
Ms. Langer realized how powerful education could be.
</P>
<P>
   She became executive director of Nabco, as it is known, in 1990,
the same year she married Charles Andrew Langer, a businessman. On
Aug. 11, 1996, there was the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in upstate New York, on one of those roads where you
see a car every five miles,'' Ms. Langer says. ``Our son had fallen
asleep in his car seat and we pulled over to put him on the back
seat. I went to the trunk to get a blanket and I got hit by a car
going 50 miles an hour. The driver had fallen asleep. I never lost
consciousness. When the ambulance crew came, I was giving them
directions: `I have lymphedema in my left arm, don't give me
anything there, watch the transfusions.' Later, when I could get
around, I went to the helicopter evacuation crew to thank them.
They said: `Oh, it's you! You didn't shut up until they put you in
the operating room. That's how we knew you were going to be OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Ms. Langer has not had rough days. ``I
loved to dance,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to walk on prosthetic legs was difficult. It was also
difficult when the producer for a television news program broke a
promise to show her only from the waist up. ``I looked really
weird. I was very upset,'' she says. ``I called my therapist and
she told me it probably wasn't as bad as I thought. She came over
and watched it with me and afterward, she said: `You're right. It's
bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langer did not turn down the news program when she was asked
to return. She and her husband dug out her prettiest high boots and
weighed them down with Beanie Babies. Ms. Langer had the boots
glued to the stage in front of her wheelchair. Then she went on.

ATTENTION INTERNET SHOPPERS: NO NEW TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Wyo., Ore., Ark., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to make
cyberspace a tax-free zone for most transactions for the next three
years, following the House in trying to help incubate a new engine
of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it grow out of its infancy before we let the tax man put
his teeth into various parts of its anatomy,'' said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., in debate Wednesday. But Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., who voted against the bill, complained in debate, ``I'm for
computers, I'm for technology, but I'm not for allowing them to
erode the tax base of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, had bipartisan support,
with many senators showing great optimism about the Internet's
prospects, even if they were uncertain about how it worked. The
Clinton administration likes it, too, taking a more anti-tax
position than some conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate versions call for a study panel and a
moratorium on new Internet taxes by state and local governments,
but the bills have to go to a conference committee to resolve minor
differences. The bill, which was passed 96-2, was backed by many
Internet companies and, after much negotiation, even the National
Governors Association acquiesced, despite its members' hunger for
sales tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the bill sought to treat sales of merchandise on
the Internet in the same way that phone or mail-order transactions
were treated. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the main Senate sponsor,
called it ``technological neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 jurisdictions could impose taxes, the supporters
noted, saying that given the decentralized nature of the Internet,
several might try on any given transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from merchandise, the bills try to block taxes on
information. Eight states, including Connecticut, already tax
Internet access, and their taxes would be grandfathered in if the
states affirmed within a year that they intended to tax Internet
access. But ``bit taxes,'' fees on electronic commerce based on the
volume of digital information transmitted, would be barred.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's main sponsor in the House, Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., said it was based on a simple principle that information
should not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said taxes on Internet transactions were acceptable if they
were the same as taxes imposed ``if it were conducted in a more
traditional manner, such as over the phone or through mail order.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, few consumers pay taxes on phone or mail-order
transactions, either. Generally, companies that sell goods by
catalog or over the Internet are supposed to collect sales taxes
and send them to the jurisdiction that the purchaser lives in if
the selling company has a store or other substantial presence in
the purchaser's state.
</P>
<P>
   But the study commission will face difficult questions. Wyden,
for example, raised the case of someone who accessed America
Online, which is based in Dulles, Va., to order a box of fruit from
a grower in Medford, Ore., paid for it with a credit card from a
bank in California and had it shipped to a relative in Boston.
Others pointed out that the Internet often defied borders; someone
in New York, for example, could pay a service provider for access
to the Internet but use the service on a laptop in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman argued that leaving the Internet alone need not create
tax winners and losers. ``The reality is, electronic commerce has
the potential to expand the winner's circle,'' he said. He cited a
hardware store in Hartford, Coastal Tool and Supply, that had first
gone on the Web because its retail sales had been hurt by the
opening of a large chain store nearby. Now, he said, ``sales have
grown almost 500 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Michael Enzi, R-Wyo., a former mayor of Gillette and a
former co-owner, with his wife, of a shoe store there, said that
denying local governments the ability to tax Internet transactions
would create ``electronic loopholes'' and deny tax revenue to the
governments most responsible for providing services. &QL;

FOX OFFICIALS TELL OF TALKS ON A DEAL WITH LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives from the Fox Broadcasting Co. said Thursday that they
have been negotiating with representatives of Monica Lewinsky to
buy rights to her account of her affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would include a primetime interview on American
television, a separate interview to be broadcast internationally
and a book.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal, first reported Thursday in Variety,
would pull together several divisions of The News Corp., Fox's
parent company: the interview would be conducted as an
entertainment show on the Fox network, the book would be published
by HarperCollins and the international interview would be carried
by BSkyB or some other broadcaster owned by The News Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Variety reported that Ms. Lewinsky would be paid $3 million for
the package, but one Fox executive, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, called the figure ``way out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lewinsky spokeswoman, Judy Smith, would not comment on the
report of talks with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fox executives said they did not believe that any deal
with Ms. Lewinsky was close to completion because other bidders
were still active and Ms. Lewinsky was known to be seeking an
intermediary to negotiate whatever deal she pursues.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Tyrer, a spokesman for the Fox Broadcasting Co., said the
company would have no further official comment beyond confirming
that ``discussions are taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Fox executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Fox had firmly decided that any interview the network conducts with
Ms. Lewinsky would be done through its entertainment division,
because no news division could legitimately pay for an interview.

COWBOYS EXPECTING PANTHERS TO HAVE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The only change the Cowboys expect out of the
Carolina Panthers in Sunday's matchup after the shocking
quarterback switch from Kerry Collins to Steve Beuerlein will be
one of attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Though his staff has just begun looking at videotape of
Beuerlein at quarterback, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the
Panthers' offense will not be that much different with the former
Cowboys backup at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, does expect the Panthers (0-4) to use the
change as a rallying point in attempt to get their first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors have gone around since Kerry made his announcement that
the guys have rallied around Steve,'' Johnston said. ``That's going
to be a big plus for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the Panthers don't have to worry about Beuerlein,
who played with the Cowboys in 1991 and 1992, quitting on them as
Collins did. Collins walked into coach Dom Capers' office Wednesday
and said he wanted to be removed from the starting lineup because
his heart wasn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most competitive people I've ever been
around,'' Johnston said of Beuerlein. ``He doesn't like to lose at
anything, whether it's a football game on Sunday or a golf game on
a Saturday afternoon in the off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Beuerlein, who started his career with the Raiders, played a key
role in the Cowboys' rise to prominence in the '90s. He replaced an
injured Troy Aikman at the end of the 1991 season, won four
consecutive games and led the Cowboys to the playoffs for the first
time since 1985. The Cowboys lost in the second round to the
Detroit Lions, but Beuerlein set the table for the 1992
championship team.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a free-agent contract with the Cardinals in 1993, and
the Panthers made him the first pick of the 1995 expansion draft.
He has backed up Collins ever since, going 3-1 in spot duty as a
starter in 1996 and was 1-2 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll mean a lot to him coming back to Dallas,'' Johnston
said. ``He has a house here; his family lives here in the
off-season. This is the place he really got a good start to his
career. So, it'll be a big game for him personally.'' &QL; 
READY FOR BLITZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing mostly zone coverage behind the blitz, Capers
asks his defensive backs to play more man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The way opponents have tried to attack this plan is by spreading
the field, employing four- and five-wide receiver sets. The
advantage, Cowboys quarterback Jason Garrett said, is that the
Panthers have to limit the amount of people they send at the
quarterback. The disadvantage is that the offense is left with
fewer people to protect the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not your typical defense,'' Garrett said. ``We'll
have to recognize where their guys are coming from.'' &QL; 
HE SAID IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams ought to start going for it on fourth down.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboys punt returner Deion Sanders, who said teams lose field
position when they punt away from him and they chance a big return
when they punt to him. &QL;
