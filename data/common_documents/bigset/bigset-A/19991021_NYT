TRANS WORLD AIRLINES SUFFERS $53.69 MILLION THIRD-QUARTER NET
LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Higher fuel costs and the negative effects of a
potential strike led to a substantial loss for Trans World Airlines
Inc. in its 1999 third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months that ended Sept. 30, TWA posted a net loss
of $53.69 million, or 87 cents a share. A year earlier, TWA lost
$5.31 million, or 18 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's results from operations also suffered. Excluding costs
related to the ratification of a new contract with the Machinists
union, TWA lost $25.41 million in operations in the quarter,
compared with an operational gain of $23.69 million in the 1998
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was up slightly to $876.43 million from $863.16 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 16,000 Machinists ratified a new contract with TWA in
July, a process that cost the company $33.52 million. TWA had
warned that business travelers were booking other airlines during
its labor uncertainty, but the third-quarter loss still was bigger
than expected, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a legitimate excuse that they struggled with the
labor issue and the loss of business travelers,'' said Bill
DiBenedetto, editor of Commercial Aviation Report, an industry
financial newsletter. ``But the excuses are starting to wear pretty
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA's yield _ the amount passengers pay for each mile traveled _
dropped 6.6 percent quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When yield goes down, you're not booking the first-class and
premium business travelers that airlines want,'' DiBenedetto said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, which affected all airlines, was higher fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Palumbo, TWA's executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said TWA paid about 28 percent more for a gallon
of fuel in the latest quarter, compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to costs at TWA is its fleet modernization program,
Palumbo said. As planes are retired, more-efficient ones are being
added to the fleet. However, they are being leased, adding to
operational expenses.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has added 30 new aircraft this year, 15 of them arriving in
the third quarter, according to Palumbo. The airline is hoping that
higher leasing costs eventually will be offset by savings generated
by planes that are more fuel-efficient and less expensive to
maintain.
</P>
<P>
   By year-end, TWA said, 40 percent of the fleet will have been
replaced since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   DiBenedetto said: ``It's a real touchy position for them because
they're taking on new planes but still have the maintenance costs
of the old planes. The fleet isn't completely replaced yet.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA is working to reverse its fortunes, said William F. Compton,
TWA's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must improve the revenue side while ... reducing the cost
side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA continues to review its route structure, seeking to
eliminate unprofitable routes, Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of TWA's strategy is to create ``focus cities,'' where TWA
will bulk up service. The first city will be San Juan, Puerto Rico,
where more flights will be added Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Compton said TWA planned to add a focus city in 2000 and another
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   On the cost side, Compton said, TWA's reservation centers are
expected to become more efficient through technological upgrades.
In addition, TWA's labor force has shrunk from last year, and
Compton said he expected that trend to continue, mainly through
attrition.
</P>
<P>
   TWA employs about 3,500 people in Kansas City, including about
2,300 at its overhaul base at Kansas City International Airport.
TWA's lease with Kansas City on the maintenance facility will
expire at the end of May 2000, and city and airline officials
continue to negotiate a renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1640, said he had
been told that TWA had responded to some terms proposed by the
city. TWA apparently is awaiting a response from city officials, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a new lease on the overhaul base to attract
third-party work there and make it a profit center again,'' Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months, TWA's net loss was $81.46 million, or $1.48
a share, on $2.51 billion in revenue. In the 1998 period, the
company lost $41.34 million, or 98 cents a share, on $2.51 billion
in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   TWA is entering what historically has been its slowest period,
but it reported holding $240 million in cash on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   TWA is ``not too worried,'' DiBenedetto said. ``They believe
their cash position is sufficient to get them through the winter.''

JOBS CAN TAKE A TOLL ON TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The high school principal bent a knee toward the floor
and clasped his hands in supplication. ``I beg you,'' he beseeched.
``Write something about high school kids working.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three in 10 full-time high school students are employed.
According to government statistics, nine out of 10 of them work
less than 35 hours a week, but some hold full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Educators aren't against students working. They know some
families need the income. They also know jobs can be terrific
teachers _ of responsibility, time management and career
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But educators oppose students working more than 15 to 20 hours a
week. And they're really averse to teens working from the time
school lets out until shifts end at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. or later.
</P>
<P>
   Students who work long, late hours fall asleep at their desks
the next day. They may not be listening. They may not be
participating in school activities. They may not be learning.
</P>
<P>
   Walk in any high school classroom on any morning. The odds are
good you'll find at least two or three teens nodding off.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, science finds they may be wired that way. Sleep
research shows that the circadian rhythm of teen-age bodies
predisposes teens to stay up until 11 p.m. and sleep late into the
morning _ several hours past the typical high school start time.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep researchers also say teens need, but don't get, nine hours
of sleep a night.
</P>
<P>
   Students who close restaurants at 11 p.m. aren't likely to head
right to bed. They'll do homework (maybe, maybe not), get on the
Internet, watch television or talk on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   University professors say the problem doesn't stop at high
school graduation. They see lots of in-class sleepers. And what
really bugs teachers is that many young workers aren't motivated by
true financial need. Working is just ``the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For what reason?'' a university educator asked. ``Many of them
don't need to work. They're living their lives in fast forward
instead of getting the maximum learning benefit available to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, I surveyed hundreds of teens for a report
on working teens. A majority said adults should chill out and let
them work. They wanted the money to buy things, they said. Besides,
there was plenty of time left to pursue loftier professional goals.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But some teens, and apparently their parents, don't
have the good sense to put a lid on school-day work hours.
</P>
<P>
   The government imposes a limit of 18 hours a school week for 14-
and 15-year-old workers and forbids work after 7 p.m. for that age
group during the school year. I wouldn't want similar dictates for
16- to 18-year-olds. There are too many personal circumstances to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   But if teens and parents can't put reasonable limits on
school-day work hours, then the appeal goes to employers: Don't
hire full-time students to lock up, work late on school nights or
work full-time-equivalent hours during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Doing well in school and learning should be teens' work. If
``invincible'' teens can't see they're being robbed, maybe you can.

SPRINT'S SOLID QUARTER TEMPERED BY SOME LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Solid third-quarter results in Sprint Corp.'s local and
long-distance businesses were tempered by widening losses from the
company's international joint venture and by ballooning costs to
develop and test its next generation of hybrid voice and data
services.
</P>
<P>
   The Westwood, Kan., company, which has agreed to be acquired by
MCI WorldCom, said Wednesday that its third-quarter profit fell 13
percent to $359 million, or 41 cents a share. That was down from
$415 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were 1 cent shy of the consensus estimate of 42 cents a
share among analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter rose 7.5 percent to $4.34 billion from
$4.04 billion. Including sales from the Sprint PCS wireless
business, revenue climbed to $5.11 billion from $4.34 billion, the
company's first $5 billion quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's shares closed Wednesday afternoon at 64 15/16, up 11/8.
Sprint PCS closed at 74, up 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go through the results operation by operation ... they
had a very solid quarter,'' said Tony Ferrugia, an analyst at A.G.
Edwards in St. Louis who recently upgraded Sprint's shares from
``hold'' to ``accumulate'' based on the premium that MCI WorldCom
agreed to pay to acquire Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global One losses were slightly higher than we had estimated,
but those will mean less now that they're going to merge with
WorldCom,'' Ferrugia said.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with small losses in what the company calls ``other
ventures,'' Sprint's share of Global One's losses increased to 11
cents a share from 4 cents a year earlier. Sprint attributed the
losses to slower regional economic growth and price competition.
</P>
<P>
   Global One's problems stem partly from uneasiness among
multinational customers as the long-troubled venture unravels.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear which of Sprint's two European partners,
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, will end up buying the
venture. But Sprint will exit the alliance, perhaps by year's end.
It has agreed to move international traffic onto MCI WorldCom's
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint also is investing heavily to revamp its fiberoptic
network as a more efficient carrier of Internet and corporate data
traffic, the growth of which is far outpacing voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The company aims to introduce a service by year's end that
bundles multiple phone lines, high-speed data connections and
unlimited long-distance calling. Costs associated with the ION
services dragged down earnings by 7 cents a share in the third
quarter, compared with 2 cents a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite big price cuts in the long-distance industry _ which
Sprint initiated with its Nickel Nights promotion _ third-quarter
long-distance revenue rose 8.4 percent to $2.71 billion from $2.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its promotions have attracted customers who
make 30 percent more calls than its average customer. The division
also benefited from increased long-distance use by Sprint PCS
wireless customers, increased long-distance sales to the company's
local customers, and a 45 percent increase in revenue from data
services.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, minutes of use on the company's network rose 23 percent
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Arthur Krause said Wednesday that
long-distance revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter
would rise by ``upper single digits'' on a percentage basis. The
company expects some softness in the business market through early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's local phone operations, revenue rose 6 percent
to $1.42 billion from $1.34 billion. Sprint added 5 percent more
phone lines as it met demand for Internet access. It ended the
quarter with 7.9 million lines.
</P>
<P>
   The local division successfully promoted its Sprint Solutions
bundle during the quarter, which combines local and long-distance
service with several premium calling features. Revenue growth from
local phone operations is expected to remain in the mid-single
digits, Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's biggest growth engine is its wireless unit, Sprint PCS,
which added a record 720,000 customers in the third quarter,
bringing its total subscriber base to 4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS launched its wireless Web service in the third
quarter, which lets subscribers access e-mail, popular Web sites
and a variety of news services. As part of its merger agreement,
MCI WorldCom will also become a branded sales agent of the wireless
service.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint expects to add 1 million customers in the fourth quarter,
traditionally the strongest quarter for wireless phone sales,
because wireless phones are popular holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Average monthly revenue per customer was unchanged at $54. Total
revenue at the wireless unit was $844 million. Net loss for the
quarter was $615 million, or $1.31 a share.

BRADY BENEFITS FROM TALE OF TAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he feels like he's not throwing accurately,
or when he's just plain struggling, Marcus Brady pops in the
videotape of last year's game against Montana State. That's a
horror flick as far as he's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, Cal State Northridge's starting quarterback, threw for a
career-low 152 yards and threw three fourth-quarter interceptions
that helped the Bobcats rally for a 32-26 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was my worst game _ ever,'' Brady said after
practice Wednesday. ``I put it behind me. I learned from it. It was
just not executing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he uses the Montana State game tape to correct sloppy
footwork. He said that contributed to his poor game, which
culminated in an interception by the Bobcats' Shon Flores with 22
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Other than correcting his physical mistakes, Brady doesn't dwell
on bad memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it,'' he said. ``There was nothing that
boggles my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Except those interceptions maybe. Brady only had 11 last year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Old school: Brady and Drew Amerson will see a familiar face
in a Montana State uniform Saturday. Jay Hackett, a freshman
defensive back, was their teammate at San Diego's Morse High.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said he's known Hackett since Pop Warner football and
Amerson said he and Hackett played in the same defensive backfield
at Morse.
</P>
<P>
   __ Revived: Sherdrick Bonner, a former quarterback at CSUN and a
member of the school's athletic Hall of Fame, was signed by the
Arizona Cardinals on Tuesday. Bonner has been a standout for the
Arizona Rattlers in the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   __ Family ties: Marc Lubick, a junior linebacker at Montana
State, is the son of Colorado State head coach Sonny Lubick and the
younger brother of Matt Lubick, a former CSUN assistant coach.

been talking about seizing control of the Brooklyn Museum of Art by
ousting its Board of Trustees. But the city's legal strategy has
evolved and now embraces a much more drastic solution, which is to
evict the museum and its vast holdings of artwork. City officials
acknowledge that this strategy could result in Brooklyn losing
possession of the nation's second largest art collection _ 1.5
million paintings, sculptures and decorative objects that took a
century to assemble. By David Barstow.

CLIPPERS SHOW SOME FORWARD MOMENTUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A visit to the Los Angeles Clippers museum of
unnatural history tells us the franchise rarely operates from a
position of strength before roll is called at the NBA draft
lottery. But after only two weeks of camp and four exhibition
games, a position of strength is emerging:
</P>
<P>
   Forward.
</P>
<P>
   While it might be a stretch to say the Clips are loaded, it is
accurate to suggest they have upgraded from slingshots to guns at
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The primary weapon is third-year power forward Maurice Taylor,
who's hanging by that contract-extension cord. Taylor has been the
poster man-child for happy campers, refusing to shoot off his mouth
or even shoot his jumper more than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Taylor responded to the consistent double-teaming by
the Suns during Tuesday's 103-96 exhibition loss at Phoenix by
handing out 11 assists. He's more altruistic these days, but a slow
adjustment to the newly enforced hand-check rule and a false-alarm
knee twinge in Toronto have conspired to keep his scoring down.
</P>
<P>
   As for Taylor's monetary aspirations?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no new developments,'' his agent, David Falk,
said of possible trades or Clippers/Taylor contract accords.
``That's a dead issue at this point. He (Taylor) is the most
valuable asset they have and they're going to lose him when his
contract expires.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Taylor, Lamar Odom, the 19-year-old, 6-foot-9
southpaw who starts at small forward, has been as good as
advertised _ despite squeezing off 61 shots in four games. He's
only made 25 of those field-goal attempts (39 percent) but has been
a better defender than expected and twice has snagged eight
rebounds in a game.
</P>
<P>
   The reserves are Brian Skinner and Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been our best player in camp from day one,'' coach Chris
Ford said of the 6-9, 250-pound Skinner, the Clippers' choice with
the 21st pick in the 1998 draft. Nesby, last season's rookie
free-agent revelation, scored 18 off the bench in Phoenix and had
19 in the opener vs. Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: For Wednesday evening's workout, the Clippers
divided their squad into two (alleged) equally matched teams and
held a public scrimmage at the Sports Arena. . . . The left ankle
of Eric Murdock has recovered enough for the veteran point guard to
make his exhibition debut Friday in Vancouver. . . . Off-guard
Derek Anderson has produced a combined 54 points in the last three
exhibition games.

50 WAYS TO MOVE THE FOOTBALL: GET A NEW PLAN, CHAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a longtime, part-time local rancher, Fox TV's Terry Bradshaw
mentioned his hesitancy to rip heavily into the Cowboys, the team
of choice in his adopted ``hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, I was on 'em real hard until somebody
shot my prized horse,'' Bradshaw said. ``But now I've got a new
barn. I can hide the horses. So I'm gonna have some things to say
this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, of course, is an NFL Hall of Famer who can also be
Hall-of-Fame wacky with off-the-wall, off-the-cuff opinions on
America's favorite pregame Sunday morning football show.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope he was kidding about that horse being shot.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, however, did make himself perfectly clear in one other
area: Chan is not the man. Or better yet, Chan Gailey's offense is
not the offense for today's NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring, it's not going to work, it's not best suited for
Troy Aikman, and if the truth were known, Troy has to hate it,''
Bradshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   All this, by the way, was told in a very public format, or at
least public on West Coast radio. It came on Tuesday afternoon's
edition of ``The Terry Bradshaw Show'', from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   I had been asked to be a guest on the show, but I did more
listening than talking, which, yes, ranks as a first.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, of course, didn't say anything that isn't also being
preached from every local soapbox this week. Terry just promised to
take it from LA radio and go national with it, come Sunday. There
is no known football hell that compares to the Cowboys going bad,
and going bad offensively they certainly are.
</P>
<P>
   When Green Bay scored 10 points last week and Brett Favre looked
awful against a shell of a Denver team, did the cheese turn green
anywhere except Wisconsin? Heck no. And how does anyone explain
2-and-4 in Minnesota? The Vikings were the preseason favorite to
win the Super Bowl. But does any human outside of a few snowplow
drivers really care about Minnesota?
</P>
<P>
   A sudden Cowboys slump, however, gets everyone stirred up, one
way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys are always going to be overrated,'' Bradshaw said.
``That's why they are Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gailey arrived here 18 months ago, he said he knew the
perils of head coaching in this town. Hopefully, he really did. If
not, he's now finding out the hard way. And Bradshaw has promised
to tell him again Sunday, right there in front of Mr. and Mrs.
America.
</P>
<P>
   Does Gailey have a ``boring offense?'' And wasn't he supposed to
be an ``offensive genius?'' Isn't that why Jerry Jones, who also
has his butt hung way out there on this one, hired Gailey in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Gailey is boring with his play calling, at least
if you think the running game is a bore.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone, including Jones, ever called him a ``genius,'' I
never heard it. What Jones said from the start, and still says, is
he wanted a head man who was offensively inclined, could call his
own plays, and would not be predictable. As opposed to Ernie
Zampese, the Cowboys' last offensive coordinator, who was hounded
by the ``too predictable'' tag.
</P>
<P>
   Do not assume, however, Ernie is now up there in New England,
privately laughing. As Ernie always joked about his play calling,
``if it works, I made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In case no one was listening, Gailey said from day one he was a
run-first offensive coordinator. He's got bells, whistles,
five-receiver sets and all kinds of other gadget plays, but first
and foremost, he believes the only way to win consistently is by
running the football.
</P>
<P>
   Norv Turner, still an offensive-coordinating god around here,
comes to Texas Stadium on Sunday with the Redskins, bringing the
exact philosophy. It worked in Dallas, and it's now working in
Washington because Norv finally found a competent quarterback to
complement the running game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Gailey stuck with the run too long in Philadelphia, and
definitely too long in the Meadowlands. And he repeatedly stayed
with the wide stuff Monday night with Emmitt, trying to beat the
Giants' run-blitz, eight-man fronts. In the end, he looked foolish
because of that.
</P>
<P>
   A Terry Bradshaw gripe is Gailey tends to ignore the deep ball,
giving in to the deep coverage of an opponent. It's true. Gailey is
very big on the ``taking what the defense gives us'' philosophy.
Except when it comes to the run, which he tried to force against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about the past two games is the offensive line, which
had nothing but regulars on the field Monday night, got its tail
whipped repeatedly. And that eventually led to offensive turmoil,
no matter what play was called.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Gailey is given the blame. Which is the way it
should be. Except when it's the Cowboys involved, that blame is
always bigger, louder, more intense and more national.
</P>
<P>
   How Gailey handles all this _ both personally and with needed
adjustments on offense _ will eventually determine if Chan is the
man. Or if a Terry Bradshaw, among many at the moment, is actually
right. nn

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If there's one thing Shandon Anderson learned during his days in
Utah, it's patience.
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, Anderson had to overcome the stigma of being a
second-round pick (1996, out of Georgia) and work his way into a
Utah lineup that had several veterans ahead of him. But through
patience, Anderson eventually became a valuable reserve on a team
that went to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then Anderson could easily have played it safe a couple of years
ago. He could have re-signed with the Jazz and spent the rest of
his career in relative security. Instead, he decided to be patient,
thinking that perhaps good things would happen when he became a
free agent at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   They did. And Anderson suddenly found himself the hottest
commodity on the free-agent market, being courted by just about
everyone, including the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson patiently weighed his options _ a little too patiently,
perhaps, for the Rockets, who waited to see where the 6-6 swingman
would land _ and decided his best opportunity was in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to prove that when you get out there and play,
you can show everybody what you can do,'' Anderson said. ``I wasn't
out there trying to show everyone, `Oh, I should have been drafted
in the first round.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thankful for the opportunity I had in Utah, and I
made the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back to what (Utah coach) Jerry Sloan told me in my
last year _ `Shandon, you put yourself in a good position; you came
in and worked hard for it.' He meant that I put myself in a
position to where I could go out and be a free agent and pick the
team I wanted to, instead of the team picking me. That's what I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets, desperately in need of athleticism, wanted
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some things that are constant and are going to fit into
any system, and that's his approach to the game, which is
full-tilt, no-nonsense and hustle,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said of Anderson. ``He's a combination of strength and quickness at
his position. You can always find ways to make that a positive for
your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, with the whole team, we're looking at different things
to try and find little niches for each guy where we can go to their
strengths. It'll take time to really hit 100 percent efficiency,
but this is just the right (system) for him right here. We really
wanted to get him, and now that we've got him, I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's a Rocket, Anderson is applying the patience he
learned in Utah to his game. After four preseason games, Anderson
is averaging just nine points on 38-percent shooting, but he's not
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is content to let his game mature as he learns along
with the rest of the new-look Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going well,'' Anderson said. ``I think it's just a matter
of getting a feel for everything now. We have a lot of the plays
down, so now it's up to us to execute everything. But we're trying
to get a feel on how to do things defensively, how to do things
offensively, and where shots are going to come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a chance to watch tapes of the games so I can get a
better feel for it than when I'm playing. (By watching tapes) I can
visualize things better. Sometimes when you're on the court, you
may think a lane is there when it's not. But I think it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's coming,'' Anderson continued. ``Right now, I'm
thinking first and then reacting instead of just flowing smoothly.
But it's just a matter of time. That's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson worked on that in Wednesday's intrasquad scrimmage,
scoring 15 points on 5-of-11 shooting and hauling in six rebounds
before about 5,000 fans at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson couldn't help but notice the five turnovers he had,
an indication of how things have gone for the Rockets in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   They are averaging 27.8 turnovers per game, one of the biggest
reasons the Rockets are 1-3 heading into tonight's game against the
Orlando Magic at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the biggest thing so far has been the turnovers,''
Anderson said. ``We've had a lot of those in the preseason. I know
we have a lot of new guys, but 30 or 35 turnovers in a game? We
can't win like that. We're losing games by eight or 10 points, and
we're having 35 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we're still scoring 90, 100 points. So you figure if we
cut down those turnovers, maybe cut them in half, then you're
looking at 110 or 120 points. When you have those kind of point
(totals), then everybody's scoring and everybody's happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with this kind of team, we can have a defense that can
keep opponents around 42- or 43-percent shooting.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ The Braves, who live by their pitching, almost died by
their hitting. They return to the World Series for the fifth time
in the 1990s because of how, in the end, they swung their bats.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros, you may have noticed, still haven't gone because
of how they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The message in all this seems clear. Pitching is the crucial
element in the long march that is the regular season and will
almost always decide who winds up in the playoffs. That's why both
the Astros and the Braves were able to survive a spring and summer
full of catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   But come the second season, it's the offense that tilts the
playing field and determines who ultimately participates in the
Fall Classic, then wins it. Everybody enters October armed and
dangerous. The hottest bats become the crucial variable, separating
the men from the boys. Score runs or become also-rans; it really is
that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 of the National League Championship Series, won 10-9 by
Atlanta in 11 tense innings, was the first in which either the
Braves or the Mets produced as many as five runs, assuming you
swallow the baseball logic of awarding Robin Ventura only a ``grand
single'' at the end of Game 5. The Braves' pitching, the sport's
reference standard over the decade and up to Tuesday almost perfect
against New York, failed horribly as a seemingly lopsided series
began to look like the worst disaster to befall this peachy
community since Gen. Sherman marched through with a box of matches.
</P>
<P>
   But having blown five- and four-run leads, the latter as late as
the seventh inning, the Braves finally sucked up at the plate,
something they had failed to do in the previous two starts in the
process of squandering a three-games-to-zip advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hit so poorly, period, in the fourth game that it left
no men on base and so poorly in crucial situations in the marathon
fifth that it stranded 19, both LCS records.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the five-run outburst at the outset of the sixth
game was mostly a byproduct of Al Leiter's inability to do anything
right as he attempted to work on three days' rest for only the
second time in his career. The Braves did all their damage without
an extra-base hit, aided and abetted by two hit batsmen, a walk and
a throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Then Atlanta's offense closed up shop for the next four innings
_ not an unfamiliar sight _ as New York chopped away at the lead,
first chasing Kevin Millwood with three runs in the sixth, then
routing a comically inept John Smoltz with a four-run flurry in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   There was no small measure of arrogance in Bobby Cox's decision
to insert Smoltz there. But clearly a great starter does not a
great reliever make, something Cox figures to be acutely cognizant
of in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the Braves got to Armando Benitez that you began
to think they might survive. They had been 0-for-26 this season
against Benitez until Eddie Perez _ who else but? _ finally
finagled a single off him earlier in the series, and they would end
Benitez's scoreless string in the 10th with a leadoff single by
Andruw Jones and Ozzie Guillen's RBI single after Ryan Klesko had
walked.
</P>
<P>
   That was Benitez's second inning, and thus Bobby Valentine had
no choice except to turn to one of his starters, Kenny Rogers, in
the 11th. Rogers, of course, would walk in the winning run, his
downfall having begun with Gerald Williams' leadoff double.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a different game in the playoffs, when every pitch is
thrown with utter concentration and full intensity. If pitchers
wore the same game faces during the regular season, most of them
would be on the DL by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be risking life and limb,'' said Smoltz, who can speak
from experience on same after accepting Cox's invitation to work
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fat offensive stats mean nothing when the slate's wiped clean as
the leaves begin to turn. The cheap at-bats are few and far
between, as everyone from Jeff Bagwell to Chipper Jones to Mike
Piazza learns. One of the reasons a lesser light such as Perez can
shine so brightly is because maybe pitchers ease off just a hair
against guys of his ilk after battling for all they're worth
against the heart of the order.
</P>
<P>
   Which, therefore, struggles accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, while you like the Braves' chances against the Yankees
because of their starting rotation _ super stoppers John Rocker and
Mariano Rivera are pretty much a wash _ the final World Series of
the '90s will be decided at the plate, not on the pitcher's mound,
with the contestants' respective fielding serving as a possible
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had statistically the best gloves in history this
season, committing only slightly more than one error every two
games. Yet they made eight against Atlanta, virtually every one of
them costly.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting and defense _ that's the ticket to a happy ending in the
postseason.

BILLIONS POURING INTO SOUTHLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors are pouring $13.6 billion into a variety of big
projects throughout Southern California, a total not seen since the
building boom of the middle to late 1980s, says a report to be
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, these projects will have wide-ranging implications
over the next five years, impacting specific industries, shaping
growth patterns and guiding land use decisions, said the study by
the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the projects cited by the LAEDC have components in the
San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County: The MetroRail Red
Line, which will end in North Hollywood; and The Walt Disney Co.'s
proposed Creative Campus in Glendale, which has yet to see its
first public hearing and is still at least a year away from initial
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the amount of money being spent across the five-county
Los Angeles region cited by the report demonstrates that cash-flush
investors have strong confidence in the region's economic future,
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of have a faint vision of it,'' he said of the
current building boom. ``But by listing them out, it's a pretty
powerful message that there is a lot going on in Southern
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the major projects either under way or already
completed:
</P>
<P>
   __ The $2.4 billion Alameda Corridor, a 20-mile rail and truck
link being carved from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to
downtown Los Angeles. It will maintain the region's position as a
leader for international trade and could increase rail traffic
through the San Gabriel Valley and northern Orange County. It is
scheduled to be finished by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   __ The $1 billion expansion of the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach, which will create larger container terminals and allow
bigger ships to dock.
</P>
<P>
   __ The $4.5 billion Red Line, which will tie tourist
destinations like Universal Studios to downtown Los Angeles. The
project is supposed to be finished by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   __ California State University, Northridge, Ventura County
satellite campus at Camarillo, which opened in August and was built
at a cost of $150million. It is the first public, four-year
university in Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   __ California Adventure, a second amusement park under
construction next to Disneyland. The resort plus added retail and
hotel elements being added to the complex are expected to cost
Burbank-based Disney $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bartolotto, director of the Burbank-based Construction
Industry Research Board, said big construction projects continue to
make gains on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the first eight months of the year, permits
have been pulled for nonresidential projects valued at about $15
billion, with more than half of that in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a historical sense, it pales somewhat against the peak
years of the 1980s,'' Bartolotto said of the private-sector
development. ``But when you take into account the public works
projects, it could bring it up to possibly record levels.''

STRONG EARNINGS REPORT EXPECTED FROM NEWHALL LAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Residential land sales are expected to fuel
another strong earnings report Thursday by The Newhall Land and
Farming Company, the largest developer in the Santa Clarita Valley,
a suburban community north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sutro &AMP; Co. estimates the developer will post earnings of 43
cents per partnership unit on revenues of $65.6million. Partnership
units are traded like stock but do not carry voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clarita-based limited partnership posted per-unit
earnings of 48 cents in the third quarter last year, but quarterly
results in development often fluctuate greatly, based on the timing
of property sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the company's going in an excellent direction,'' said
analyst Craig Silvers at Sutro, the only firm that actively tracks
Newhall Land partnership units. ``It's in an enviable position,
having a considerable amount of residential land available in the
tight Southern California market.''
</P>
<P>
   Land sales will likely be a major contributor to the company's
quarterly results, including ongoing sales of lots in the
Bridgeport housing development.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers said the other major contributor will be
income-producing properties, including shopping centers and
apartment complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land officials have pledged to sell many of the
income-producing properties to finance an aggressive effort to
repurchase about 6.3million partnership units, or 20 percent of
those outstanding units. Company officials announced last month
that they will repurchase 5.5million units in addition to about
800,000 already bought back.
</P>
<P>
   But the repurchase efforts have done little to revive prices for
Newhall Land's partnership units, which closed at $25 Wednesday,
far below the 1998 high of $34.75. The company's own conservative
estimate of net appraised value per unit is $29.72, and that
estimate was made before the approval of the company's 21,615-home
Newhall Ranch project.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the vast housing project, however, have languished in
court, and Attorney General Bill Lockyer recently weighed in on the
side of Newhall Ranch opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers said uncertainty over the Newhall Ranch project would
have little immediate effect on the partnership unit price that he
said is already below its true value.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's main strengths _ including large residential
land holdings and a strong economy _ will likely keep Newhall Land
humming, Silvers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the long-term prospects are excellent,'' he said.
``The company is in an enviable position.''

COWBOYS' HARPER STILL MAD AT REDSKINS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Alvin Harper couldn't have personally picked a
better time to begin his second tour of duty with the Cowboys than
this week against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that the 32-year-old wide receiver, who will be
activated for Sunday's game at Texas Stadium, will not be shaking
Redskins coach Norv Turner's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Turner ran him off without giving him a fair chance in 1997,
Harper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what would be his dream scenario after what has
happened to him in failed free-agent bids with Tampa Bay and
Washington, Harper replied, ``It's not a dream. Norv knew he didn't
do me right. He didn't even give me a chance. They lied to me. They
were liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said as much on Nov. 30, 1997, one day before he was
released: ``It's ridiculous the way I've been used. There's been
nothing but a whole bunch of lies. They expect me to come in for
one out of every 15 plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Harper was called into Turner's office and handed
his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess (Turner) didn't appreciate me calling him a liar,''
Harper said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Turner called the decision to release the high-priced free agent
merely one ``based on production.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers would bear him out. Harper, who suited up for 11 of
12 games before his release, ended up catching two passes for 65
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I said what I said in the newspaper: `Release me.
You're not going to play me.' I can go be a statue somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he and Turner ever tried to resolve their
differences before it came to that, Harper replied, ``The only time
we talked about it was when he brought me in to release me. That's
the only time we talked ... and I really didn't have any words for
him anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, Harper said, told both fellow receiver Leslie Shepherd
and him at the start of the '97 training camp that they would be
vying for playing time, saying, ``No one is the starter right now.
Both of you guys will get equal play, and we'll just evaluate it
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Harper now recalls, ``I never got `equal' anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday if he had anything to say about Harper's
latest remarks, Turner replied, ``Nothing ... nothing. Sometimes it
works out. Sometimes it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper left the Cowboys after the 1994 season to become somebody
else's go-to guy after four seasons of playing in Michael Irvin's
shadow and signed as an unrestricted free agent with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has no animosity toward the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what they had to do; I didn't do what I was supposed
to do. I don't fault them,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper twice was injured during practice Wednesday, first
dislocating the ring finger on his left hand, then pulling a muscle
in his right hamstring. Both times, he received treatment and
returned to team drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in great shape yet,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said
after practice. ``We'd like to have another week or two before we
had to throw him in there, but he will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice Wednesday, Harper went deep against cornerback Charlie
Williams and caught long passes from Troy Aikman. Even though the
offense has changed in Dallas, Harper is confident that he can
still make big plays if he is allowed to run some of his old
favorite routes: Deep post, stutter-and-comeback, stutter-and-go,
the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who hasn't played since November 1997, was sitting
around his living room in Fort Washington, Va., when he decided
that he was still better than some of the NFL receivers he was
watching on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I came to that decision (to play again) and made
the phone call (to the Cowboys),'' Harper said. ``There is some
ungodly material out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper called Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones to see what
was going on and ask for a tryout. This was 10 days before Irvin
suffered a spinal contusion in an awkward tumble after a tackle at
Philadelphia on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a ``courtesy tryout'' has developed into a
minimum-wage signing (Harper gets the $400,000 minimum for a
veteran) and has turned possibly into some playing time now that
rookie Wane McGarity (dislocated shoulder) is expected to be out
two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be playing at New Orleans, but I didn't want to go
down there. Actually, I didn't want to play anymore (after being
released by Washington),'' Harper said. ``I began thinking that I
had had enough ... that I would just play me some golf every day
for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Harper is thinking about reuniting with Aikman on Sunday
afternoons. This week, it will be against his old team _ and
especially his old coach _ that chased him off and, he believes,
nearly out of the league for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very exciting to make a big play, perhaps even
score a touchdown Sunday,'' Harper said, ``then I could go dunk the
goal post again.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be in lieu of a handshake for Turner.

PAULIE AYALA'S FOE PACKING CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As he waited for his interpreter to take him
to his first genuine Texas dinner, an expressionless Saohin Srithai
Condo rested in the lobby of the Ramada Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry and anxious, he sat quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Just like he did in December, when Johnny Tapia bypassed Condo
to challenge then-champion Nana Konadu for the World Boxing
Association bantamweight (118-pound) title.
</P>
<P>
   And just like he did when Tapia dodged him to fight Fort Worth's
Paulie Ayala in June.
</P>
<P>
   In his first trip to the United States, patience has already
become one of the defining characteristics of the Thai challenger.
Patience combined with a right hand that has collected 19 knockouts
in 34 bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be a hero,'' said Condo, his words translated
by interpreter Anant Jethanamest. ``I want to be a hero to Thailand
and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Condo (27-6, 19 knockouts) will finally get his chance at a
title Saturday night, when he challenges Ayala for his WBA
bantamweight belt at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to fight Konadu, Tapia, then, all of a sudden,
we don't,'' said Pai Rat, Condo's trainer. ``We were very
disappointed, but now we are happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight between Ayala and Tapia (in Las Vegas) was close. It
was hard to see a winner. We could have beat Tapia, also.''
</P>
<P>
   Condo has brought only the necessities from Thailand. He arrived
in Texas with an entourage that consisted of his manager, an
interpreter, his trainer, and a sparring partner.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought plenty of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident, and I'm ready for Saturday's fight,'' said
Condo, a former kick-boxer. ``I am ready for a knockout at any
time, but I cannot predict which round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a champion. Whenever the chance comes, I will do
it. I am anxious to knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Condo won his past 10 bouts by knockout and has
not lost since 1995. He has been the WBA's No. 1-ranked
bantamweight for almost a year, though he has never fought or even
visited the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He has trained for the past 21/2 months and has endured more
than 120 rounds in preparation for Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie is good, but he can be beaten,'' said Niwat
Laosuwanwat, Condo's manager. Condo ``is very excited, and he is
anxious to get into it with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Condo's camp does not expect to be bothered by the hometown
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have 5,000 Thai people there, '' Jethanamest said.
``We will have support for our fighter. It will be a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Ayala, meanwhile, was impressed with the top contender's
silent confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is obviously ready, and prepared,'' said Rick Yuill,
Ayala's co-manager at Boxing Management, Inc. ``He seems very
confident and I am sure he will be going for a knockout.'' nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Galaxy defender Danny Pena had his right knee
wrapped in ice during Wednesday's training session at Jackie
Robinson Field outside the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Pena explained that it was only a precaution and insists he'll
be fine for Sunday's playoff game against Colorado at Mile High
Stadium. The Galaxy beat the Rapids 3-0 Sunday to take a 1-0 lead
in the best-of-three Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, normally the one to turn a lazy training session into a
war with his harsh comments, enjoyed what he observed from the
sidelines this time. There was shouting, hard tackles, and even a
brief scuffle between Clint Mathis and Ezra Hendrickson _ though it
was all taken with the right attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when the intensity level is like this,'' said Pena.
``You saw a playoff practice right here. I just wish I could have
been in there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Greg Vanney said there is a different feeling during
the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to this team being focused,'' said Vanney.
``It's something that hasn't been here in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win a playoff game 3-0 with 10 players unless you're
training like this. This is how you become a championship team.
This is how it is in Europe, with people battling for their spots
every day. It's not how long you practice but the intensity and
effort you give. I think today was a good sign of what lies
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Weather or not: While the Galaxy continues to train in the
mid-day heat, Schmid is not concerned with the forecast in Denver.
There was snow and temperatures in the 40s last weekend, and Sunday
could be more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forecast can change in a day there,'' said Schmid. ``I saw
one forecast where it was supposed to be in the 70s this weekend.
Then I saw another that said it would be in the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a buddy who was up there for some games last weekend. He
said when he landed Saturday, it was 86 and the next day it was 43.
So, we've got to be prepared for anything. At least we're playing
during the day and not at night.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hermosillo update: Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo gave a
thumbs up when asked if he was ready to start. Hermosillo missed
Sunday's opening playoff game with a bruised knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always the plan to rest Carlos and play him in this
game,'' Schmid said.

MU RESEARCHERS HELP LEND CLUES TO FEMALE PUBERTY STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A team of researchers, including two University of
Missouri-Columbia scientists, say they may have found some clues to
why young girls today reach puberty at younger ages.
</P>
<P>
   And the clues may point to a chemical that's commonly found in
plastic products.
</P>
<P>
   Kembra Howdeshell, an MU doctoral candidate, and Frederick vom
Saal, a biology professor, teamed with North Carolina State
researchers on a new study that appears Thursday in the scientific
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   They exposed mice still in the womb to the chemical bisphenol A,
at a level similar to what humans are exposed to routinely.
Bisphenol A is a ``building block'' for polycarbonate plastic
products such as baby bottles, food can linings and food storage
containers.
</P>
<P>
   The exposed mice developed puberty earlier than normal, and they
also found that the mice exposed in the womb to the chemical
weighed 20 percent more than normal at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, an exposure in the womb could have effects after
birth, the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the largest effects happened to the babies of
the pregnant mother,'' Howdeshell said. ``The chemical did not
affect the mother, but instead it altered the babies' growth
patterns and accelerated timing of sexual maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study shows that this chemical may be a factor for
contributing to trends seen in human populations over the past
several decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Manufacturers Association could not comment on the
new study. The group has yet to review it, said Frank Rathbun, a
spokesman for the industry group.
</P>
<P>
   But the manufacturers association has cautioned against jumping
to conclusions about studies of animals and the effects of
chemicals like bisphenol A, which can act in an animal's body like
a hormone. Any adverse effect in humans is far from proven, the
association has maintained.
</P>
<P>
   These chemicals, known as hormonally active agents, can mimic
the actions of sex hormones and have been associated with adverse
reproductive and developmental effects in wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Manufacturers Association points to the work of
Elizabeth Whelan, who directs the American Council on Science and
Health. Whelan has said the human body has demonstrated that it can
deal with these chemicals, in normal amounts.
</P>
<P>
   MU researcher vom Saal, one of the study's co-authors, agreed
that more study is required before scientists can say with more
certainty the threats posed to humans exposed to these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not offering an answer concerning effects in humans with
these findings,'' vom Saal said. ``Instead the findings pose a
question regarding human health....We believe the medical community
should take a long look at this study and consider looking at
(bisphenol A) as a possible cause for the changes in growth, sexual
maturation and reproductive abnormalities that have been reported
in humans in the past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, a National Research Council Committee concluded that
there is evidence of harmful health and ecological effects
associated with exposure to hormonally active chemicals. But it
added little is understood about the exposure to these substances
at low concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determining the risk to humans from contact with these
chemicals in the environment is difficult because ordinary exposure
to these agents has not been routinely monitored,'' Ernst Knobil, a
professor at University of Texas Medical School in Houston, said in
August. ``Determining what these exposures actually are is
therefore of primary importance.''

JONES' FAITH IN GAILEY STEADFAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Roughly 20 months and 22 games have passed since
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones introduced an unknown assistant
coach from Pittsburgh as the fourth coach in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Cowboys (3-2) riding a two-game losing streak
heading into Sunday's rematch with the high-flying Washington
Redskins (4-1), Gailey is getting roundly criticized for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   His offense is bearing the brunt of the blame after scoring just
20 points in the past two weeks, and critics are starting to
question his tag as an offensive guru.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was less talkative than normal in Wednesday's media
briefing _ perhaps choosing to retreat quickly to his office to
work on correcting his team's problems _ Gailey seems to be holding
up well under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   He did acknowledge, however, that there's a sense of urgency for
a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``There better be,'' Gailey said. ``Something is wrong with us
if it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has received his share of criticism through the
years, remains unfazed. All the fuss means to him is that Gailey
has finally arrived as the Cowboys' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in any way having any type of emotion or sensitivity
about Chan being criticized,'' Jones said. ``That's life. Where I'm
coming from with Chan having criticism doesn't surprise me. I've
said to Chan several times that over the course of time, they are
going to be on you and they are going to be on me. A lot of times,
it's because it's not working right. We've just got to stick to the
things we believe in _ your philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones readily admits that Sunday's game against the
division-leading Redskins is crucial to the Cowboys' season _
because it will allow the Cowboys to keep pace in the NFC East race
and boost their confidence heading into a stretch of the schedule
that includes Indianapolis, Minnesota and Green Bay. But Jones
remains firm in his support of Gailey and believes things will
improve.
</P>
<P>
   The primary source of Jones' optimism is Gailey, whom he calls
one of the hardest working and most creative coaches in the NFL.
Jones said he backs Gailey's decision to simplify things in his
offense and holds Gailey's willingness to adjust as an example of
why he thought he would make such a good head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of Chan's best qualities,'' Jones said. ``I
sit in there and look at film with him. And he says, `If I had that
to do over again, I wouldn't call that.' He will quickly
acknowledge mistakes and say we won't do that again, which I think
is very healthy for the team's future and franchise. I know he'll
figure out a way to move the football and score touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the uproar over the Cowboys' two-game losing streak
is understandable and predictable. He said he's not worried because
of past experience. The Cowboys have suffered back-to-back losses
in a season and reached the playoffs five times since 1991,
including Super Bowl title seasons of 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we should do is reflect back on our experience and look
back at when this has happened to us,'' Jones said. ``Everybody was
preaching doomsday then.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting safety George Teague (strained neck) didn't practice
Wednesday and is doubtful for the Redskins game. Teague said the
doctors don't think he would finish the game without re-injury and
that he won't play unless he shows progress over the next few days.
Izell Reese would likely start in his place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive tackle Chad Hennings (strained neck) did not
practice Wednesday. He should get back on the field later in the
week and is questionable for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Deion Sanders (sprained right ankle) did not
practice Wednesday. He's listed as probable for Sunday's game and
is likely to return to the practice field Thursday.

Sore foot sidelines Finley 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ Moments after he was examined by Dr. Jim Brodsky
yesterday, Mavericks guard Michael Finley wore a look of doom and
gloom.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finley had been told he will miss the Mavericks' remaining four
preseason games because of plantar fasciatis in his right heel. He
is scheduled to undergo a bone scan today, which will determine if
he has a stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has played in 297 consecutive regular-season games, the
fourth-longest streak among active players. He concedes that the
streak might be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go out there and play and not be able to help
the team, and be more of a burden to the team,'' Finley said.
``That's not going to help me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'll take the time off for some rest and relaxation.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash also will be sidelined for the remainder
of the preseason. Nash was examined yesterday, and started rehab
after it was discovered he has a strained tendon in his right
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks trainer Roger Hinds said Finley and Nash should be
ready for the Nov. 2 regular-season opener against the Golden State
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, center Shawn Bradley skipped yesterday's practice and
is listed as day-to-day with a strained lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Hubert Davis practiced yesterday for the first time since
suffering the flu before Saturday's preseason game against
Charlotte. Davis said he is physically fit and will play tonight
against the Toronto Raptors at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Finley's heel had been so sore that he missed Sunday's preseason
game against Detroit. But he might have aggravated it when he
played in Tuesday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks in Madison,
Wis. Finley played at the University of Wisconsin, which retired
Finley's jersey before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before \RTuesday\S night the heel was fine,'' Finley said.
``Maybe I rushed back a little bit too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the pain is hard to explain. It's like getting kneed in
the thigh, but it's in your heel. The pain is there in the morning
and in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, one of the Mavericks' co-captains, has led the team in
scoring the past two seasons with averages of 21.5 and 20.2 points
per game, respectively. With Finley, Nash and Bradley missing
yesterday's practices, embattled Mavericks coach/general manager
Don Nelson is unsure when to expect them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out for a period of time,'' Nelson said. ``I don't
really know. I'm not really good at guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but it's clear the injuries have muddled Nelson's
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cuts it down,'' he said. ``But it gives me a chance to play
some of these younger guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RPoint guard\S Kevin Ollie got a nice opportunity and I
thought played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Erick Strickland, who scored a game-high 26 points on
10-of-13 shooting in Tuesday's 107-96 loss to the Bucks, also has
an opportunity to continue playing. Both Ollie and Strickland are
expected to receive their share of playing time when the Mavericks
play host to Toronto at 7:30 tonight.  &QL; 
Master P arrives Robyn Hunter, advertising and promotions
coordinator for the Mavericks, said she gave away more than 200
tickets to various radio station listeners this week for tonight's
game. Hunter said most of the listeners were eager to see Raptors
guard Percy Miller, the rap artist known as Master P.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who used to play AAU basketball in New Orleans with
Mavericks guard Robert Pack, is trying to revive his basketball
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get in the game, I do the best that I can do,''
Miller said yesterday afternoon from his hotel room in Denver,
where the Raptors were preparing to play the Nuggets. ``Hopefully,
if this thing works out, I'll be signing a contract next week.''
</P>
<P>
   This also will be Vince Carter's first trip to Reunion Arena.
Carter was the NBA rookie of the year last season.

PUBLIC MEMORIALS ENABLE MOURNERS TO CONNECT WITH GRIEVING
FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY and JOHN MARTELLARO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Strangers cried for Pamela Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, many of whom had never heard Pamela's name until she
was snatched last week while skating in front of her home,
overflowed Wednesday's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   They cried for a 10-year-old girl they'd never met. They cried
for her family.
</P>
<P>
   And they cried for themselves. Pamela's face became their
child's face.
</P>
<P>
   Her kidnapper ``could have driven down my street,'' Ravon
Andrade, a mother who lives in Overland Park, said outside
CrossRoads Church after the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Across the metropolitan area, thousands of people who never knew
Pamela are mourning her loss, in much the same manner _ if not to
the same degree _ as the family and friends who loved her.
</P>
<P>
   People have always grieved over the loss of well-known
strangers, from tribal chieftains and Roman emperors to Princess
Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But grief experts say a death such as Pamela's touches a deeper
chord, because of the frightening way in which the Kansas City,
Kan., child was stolen from what should have been a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   Intense media coverage amplifies those emotions _ emotions that
people today feel more comfortable expressing.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, scenes of violent or tragic death are turned into
makeshift memorials where loved ones _ and often, strangers, too _
leave flowers, letters and other tributes or remembrances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are ceremonies. They are like memorials; they are the
ways that people heal themselves from the loss. It's one of the
most positive things people can do,'' said Kathy Smith, executive
director of the Grief Support Network, a coalition of local support
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a phenomenon because that form of ritual was
lost from our society. People used to do things like that all the
time. That's something that needs to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have already experienced a loss _ particularly the
loss of a child _ a case such as Pamela's can stir long-suppressed
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still working on your own personal grief and any
subsequent loss simply triggers the unresolved grief,'' said
therapist Delpha Camp of Eugene, Ore., who is the national
president of the Association For Death Education and Counseling.
</P>
<P>
   At her funeral, Pamela was described as ``shy, but with lots of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no idea how many.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Millican, 9, skipped school to be there _ with her
mother's permission. She wore her best dress and a purple ribbon
because she knew purple was Pamela's favorite color.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't think it odd that she wanted to attend. To hear her
explain it, there are no strangers among little girls that age.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was probably about like me,'' Ashley said. ``And I think
it's so sad that everything she did this year was her last
time...last Christmas, last birthday, last Easter...and she never
even knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   The public reaction to Pamela's tragedy has been enormous,
perhaps unprecedented: nightly vigils at her home, memorial
services at her school and at the Grain Valley, Mo., church near
where her body was found, live television coverage of her funeral
service Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A violent, unexpected death _ especially that of a child _
usually draws a community response beyond the immediate circle of
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Crump, a bereavement counselor for D.W. Newcomer's
Sons funeral homes, said the intensity of the media coverage of
Pamela's case has helped to generate a higher level of response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we turn on the TV, there's an update on the search
or on the tragedy, so we get involved in it,'' Crump said.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Thomas, a Belton, Mo., mother of six, attended Wednesday's
funeral. Like most, she watched last week as the tragedy unfolded
in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting so much inside, I had to come today,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, David Ramos, 21, was there from California.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I have protected my little sisters,'' he said.
``Something like this scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the news media respect the boundaries set by the
family, Crump and others said, the attention can be a positive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love someone and that person dies, you want the world
to know this person existed and they meant something to someone,''
Crump said. ``All of this outpouring...confirms the loss and
confirms the value the person had for their family and friends and
schoolmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Davis, a community education specialist with Kansas City
Hospice, said public support can be very valuable for a family,
even though it can also be viewed on another level as an intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the community shows up and gives support is an
important statement to the family,'' Davis said. ``Down the road,
there may be a downside: `The whole world knows what happened to me
and my family' _ it's not a private matter, it's public.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing that kind of support was what drew Stacie Schemmel to
attend Pamela's funeral, along with her daughters Samantha, 5, and
Breana, 1. Schemmel said she was there for Cherri West, Pamela's
mother, whose face last week became a symbol of parental grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shared it with all of us,'' Schemmel said. ``I think she's
glad we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the media have made grief more public than before,
which he believes is a good thing. American culture has tended to
encourage people to stifle or deny their grief, he said, but
depicting expressions of grief as normal and natural helps make it
more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we see it, we see the tears and hugs,'' Davis said. ``It's
very healthy, but our society has always taught the opposite of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the CrossRoads Church Wednesday, there was talk of anger and
revenge, as well as sorrow. One man, a father, started to say what
he would do with Pamela's abductor. Then he caught himself. Church
music played.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a story for another day,'' he said.

 Victim of home-improvement debacle receives help from unlikely
source  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ About two weeks ago David Hyatt dropped by
the house on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   It was a common stop for Hyatt, who works for mortgage
companies, foreclosing on properties and clearing out residents.
Hyatt knew the drill: Drop in and forewarn residents about their
scheduled eviction day.
</P>
<P>
   But stepping inside that Kansas City home at 5117 Woodland Ave.,
something changed for Hyatt. He didn't like what he saw. Not one
bit.
</P>
<P>
   At the door was Martha Williams, 76 years old and barely
clearing four feet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a house Hyatt guessed was hardly worth $10,000, Williams
had made a sparse but cozy home for her disabled adult son, Dusty,
and their shepherd mix, Bear.
</P>
<P>
   For Hyatt it meant a change of plans. He found himself getting
involved on her behalf, and he was not alone: In the last two
weeks, several different groups _ from the Kansas City mayor's
office to the local legal community _ have raced to aid Martha
Williams. Many were afraid that Williams was enticed into a
home-improvement arrangement that, while perfectly legal, is often
specifically directed toward low-income older adults.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had lived in the home 30 years, she told Hyatt, raised
all her children there and cared for her husband until he passed
away. She remains a companion for her son, who has cerebral palsy,
uses a wheelchair and spends his days tending to his baseball card
collection, watching out the porch window and greeting neighborhood
visitors with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Williams told Hyatt, a remodeling company came
calling. Now, because she unwittingly took out a high-interest,
$15,000 home improvement loan _ and could not pay it off _ she was
losing her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she knew what she was doing,'' Hyatt said. ``I
don't want to put out this little old lady.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday _ a day before her scheduled eviction _ those
parties convinced a judge to postpone it. Instead, there will be
another hearing on her case in two weeks in Jackson County Circuit
Court.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for ContiMortgage, the Hatboro, Pa.-based company that
holds the note for loan against the home, said he could not comment
on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, family members who have been taking time off from
work, calling agencies to find solutions, are relieved that they
have more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing,'' said Williams' daughter, Maxine Williams.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about Martha Williams' situation, several people
in the newly created Mayor's Neighborhood Advocate Office went to
work calling agencies for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all kind of went to work on it,'' said office member Regina
Chandler. ``She was attempting to pay (the loan) but couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate part of Williams' situation, Chandler said, is
that she could have applied for a low-interest loan from a local
community development corporation had she known whom to contact.
The city can also help homeowners make wheelchair-accessible
improvements for free, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she never went looking for a loan, it came to her.
About two years ago, she said, several construction company
solicitors inquired whether she wanted home improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she did. But she was retired, she recalls having told
them, and a widow caring for her disabled son. Her house was paid
off, but she didn't have much money to spend. They promised to be
reasonable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked so nice,'' she said. ``So I said: `Yeah.'''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't tell her children, she said. She wanted to surprise
them.
</P>
<P>
   Some improvements were made, Williams said, but she wasn't happy
with the work.
</P>
<P>
   Before she knew it, the payments got ahead of her. Now she feels
she was fooled by the solicitors who steered her to the
high-interest loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how people can do you,'' she said Tuesday
in her home, her eyes tearing up. ``They talk to you so nice. Then
they turn around and throw you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, lending agencies that focus on the elderly have been
a concern, said Anne Deaton, a deputy director with the Missouri
Division of Aging. Complaints about such cases are rare in Kansas
City, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With senior citizens, Deaton said, the rule of ``buyer beware''
becomes more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really goes for seniors, because it may have been some
time since they've had some work done,'' she said, and their guard
is down.
</P>
<P>
   People working with Williams said they hope to arrange another
loan before the next hearing or work toward getting Williams and
her son new living arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Her would-be evictor, for one, is anxious to see that happen.
Hyatt is not sure he could bring himself to kicking Martha
Williams, her sweet-eyed son and tail-wagging dog out of their
little home on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are people,'' he said. ``She doesn't have anywhere to
go.''

WTO PROTEST MISSES THE MASSES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien
Wednesday night extolled benefits of ``the new global economy,''
while outside the hotel where he was speaking a crowd of
anti-globalization protestors proclaimed the street ``a WTO-free
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a warmup for when the World Trade Organization convenes in
Seattle next month, a coalition of labor, environmental and civil
liberties groups sought to upstage the prime minister and gain
recruits for demonstrations planned in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A music group called the Flying Folk Army performed. A group of
University of British Columbia students vowed to go on a seven day
anti-WTO hunger strike beginning on America's Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   But this anti-WTO mass protest lacked one essential ingredient _
the masses. It was all bullhorn and few cattle. Only about 300
people, less than one-third the crowd predicted by Vancouver
Police, showed up in the streets. They were easily contained by a
squad of police on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Chretien preached globalism to a
crowd of more than 1,300 supporters and raised $400,000 (Canadian)
for Canada's ruling Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer will British Columbia or Canada be the best kept
secret in the global economy,'' declared Chretien. In what he
called the upcoming ``Century of the Pacific,'' the prime minister
vowed to intensify promotion of foreign investment in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But the new global economy was seen as a Halloween-like house of
horrors to activists who used chalk to write out such slogans as
Wicked Tyrants Oppression on the pavement of Burrard Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO is a handy super-national forum for corporations to
downsize the importance of government and sell out our national
sovereignty,'' said Barbara Waldern, who is organizing
Vancouver-area volunteers to join in the upcoming Seattle protests.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ogilvie, active with the Public Service Alliance of
Canada, added: ``It is dangerous when the powers of democratic
governments are frozen or circumvented by actions of non-democratic
international trade organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about 15 years ago, Canada was a very nationalist,
somewhat protectionist place.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Investment Review Agency had the task of keeping
American capital from expanding its hold on various sectors of
Canada's economy. A government-owned oil company, Petro-Canada, was
formed in part to break the hold of U.S. oil companies on Canada's
energy economy.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1984, newly elected Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
proclaimed Canada ``open for business.'' It has been ever since.
Chretien's Liberal Party was bitterly opposed when Canada signed up
with the United States and Mexico in the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in power, however, the Liberals have become
enthusiastic supporters of NAFTA, and Chretien played host to the
1997 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The APEC conference did see big protests. At one point, Royal
Canadian Mounted Police officers ordered demonstrators to disperse,
and moved in nine seconds later with pepper spray. Chretien was
widely criticized for joking that he preferred pepper on his plate
at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime minister has had the last laugh. The latest
opinion poll in British Columbia shows Chretien's Liberals with 53
percent support compared to only 23 percent for the opposition
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   An official inquirey is still looking into police conduct at the
anti-APEC protests, but Chretien was cracking jokes Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you so much I decided to have the APEC meeting here,''
he said. ``I do not know what I will do to keep you on the map, but
I will find something.''
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Chretien demonstration last November erupted into a
brawl when a few of the protestors tried to break through police
lines. Wednesday night, however, all was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Penned in by watchful police on motorcycles and bicycles, a
remnant of 75 to 100 demonstrators marched down Robson Street, site
of Vancouver's ritziest import shops. They banged drums and blew
whistles, which drew only momentary stares from restaurant diners.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is likely to see more seasoned activists when the
Emerald City plays host to a big anti-WTO protest on Nov. 30.
Colleen McRory, leader of the Valhalla Society _ one of British
Columbia's most resourceful environmental groups _ ignored
Chretien's speech but said Wednesday she will bring several vans
full of demonstrators to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO stands for a corporate takeover of all our
resources,'' said McRory, citing Weyerhaeuser's recent acquisition
of MacMillan-Bloedel, British Columbia's largest forest products
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legitimate issues out there for which we must get
attention,'' McRory added. ``We face a future of minimal
environmental controls for ancient forests already under stress.
Global agreements push management of land and forests and resources
away from local communities, and even countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-WTO protest will bring ``unprecedented networking of
different movements in North America and all over the world,'' said
Bryce Scott, organizer for a group called Peoples Action for
Threatened Habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, however, the main networking was done by
Vancouver business leaders and Asian guests gathered for the
British Columbia Prime Minister's Dinner. The Hyatt Regency
ballroom was definitely NOT a WTO-free zone.

BETTMAN CHECKS OUT NEW DIGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the dignitaries at Wednesday's first Kings
game at the Staples Center was National Hockey League commissioner
Gary Bettman, who many credit with the boom in new arenas
league-wide.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, who took over as commissioner in February 1993 after
years as a critical member of the NBA's growth, has seen the Kings
go from bankruptcy in the post-Bruce McNall era to a team with a
state-of-the-art facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy, that's ancient history,'' Bettman said. ``You get
judged not by your problems but how you deal with them. This
franchise can say it has dealt with its problems. No franchise can
say it has better ownership or a better building than this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said he is especially pleased with the downtown location
of the arena, previously believed to be a difficult sell to fans
driving in from such a large metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building is going to be an important part of Los Angeles,
especially downtown L.A,'' he said. ``It gives the Kings a great
home for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bettman's first tasks as commissioner was overseeing the
Kings ownership shift from McNall to Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph
Cohen. McNall had left the team in financial trouble and the new
owners were stung by the owners lockout, which wiped out almost
half of the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at this arena, a lot of the credit goes to Gary
Bettman,'' said Rogie Vachon, the one-time Kings goalie and now an
assistant to general manager Dave Taylor. ``There have been a lot
of new buildings go up and that was his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it by taking control of the decision-making. Before he
got here, the NHL was very political and a lot didn't get done. He
got rid of the politics and that really helped move the league
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Missing Man: One of the reasons for the Bruins' 0-5-3 start
has been a lack of offense. Their 12 goals coming in tied Buffalo
for last in the league. But the team also is playing without
goaltender Byron Defoe, a restricted free agent who is sitting out
in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Defoe, who played with the Kings for two seasons (1995-97), had
his best season last year, earning a second-team All-Star
selection. He also was a finalist in the Vezina Trophy balloting
for the league's top goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   In 68 games, Defoe had a 1.99 goals-against average with 10
shutouts. In 12 playoff games it was 2.03 with two shutouts.

TEN TO REMEMBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Ten firsts at the new Staples Center (in
chronological order): 
__ First sellout: A capacity crowd of 18,118 was announced, but
there were many empty seats on the lower two levels. Dedicated
fans. The Kings had announced capacity was 18,500 but downgraded
that number. 
__ First member of the Kings organization introduced in pregame
ceremonies: Assistant equipment manager Rick Garcia, a key cog in
the machine. 
__ First person to sing national anthem: Broadway star Davis
Gaines, whose spirited version might turn out to be the ``best'' in
the life of the arena. 
__ First shot: Luc Robitaille, which seems appropriate. Time:
1:16. 
__ First goal: Anson Carter, which seems inappropriate. He took a
pass from Jonathan Girard and flipped the puck past Kings goalie
Stephane Fiset from a few feet in front of the net. Time: 4:12 of
the first period. 
__ First penalty: Darren Van Impe of Boston, two minutes, roughing.
Somewhere in the scuffle that preceded the penalty, the first punch
was thrown by someone. Or was it a push? Time: 7:06, first period. 
__ First Kings penalty: Craig Johnson, two minutes, holding.
Johnson is one the least-penalized players on the team. He had 32
penalty minutes all last season and six in eight games this year.
Time: 10:00, first period. 
__ First disgruntled fan: A frustrated guy sitting below the press
box as the Kings squandered a power-play opportunity. ``Somebody
shoot the &AMP;% puck.'' Also the first expletive. Time: 15:50, first
period. 
__ First Kings goal: Rob Blake, which also seems fitting. The
Kings' captain blasted a slap shot from just inside the blue line
past Boston goalie Robbie Tallas on a power play. Time: 10:32 of
the second period. 
__ First tie: A boring way to start an era.!dlim!!end!

A NEW START IS MUSIC TO THEIR EARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just listen to the murmurs of the people
</P>
<P>
   in the building,
</P>
<P>
   look up at the scoreboard where the news is good, fate willing.
</P>
<P>
   How
</P>
<P>
   can they
</P>
<P>
   lose?
</P>
<P>
   The future is brighter,
</P>
<P>
   there you can forget all the
</P>
<P>
   failures, forget all the tears.
</P>
<P>
   So go _ downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Things will be great now they're _ downtown.
</P>
<P>
   No finer place for sure _ downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Randy Newman's ``I Love L.A.'' It's so passe. Every new
era deserves its own soundtrack. On the night the Kings cast off
their past like a worn pair of paisley pants, we had a Clark oldie
on our minds. Not Wendel Clark, mind you, but Petula.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after she recorded ``Downtown,'' Clark's
buoyant tune _ with a little tweaking of the lyrics _ would have
been beautiful background music for the era that opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $375 million Staples Center is so much more than the Kings'
new address. It's the marble and mortar from which they can shape a
whole new identity, only miles apart from Sam McMaster's disastrous
deal-making, Robbie Ftorek's psychedelic sweaters, Tom Webster's
excruciating earaches, Marty McSorley's curved stick, Bruce
McNall's crooked finances and Wayne Gretzky's lamentable departure.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' slate is as clean as the Staples Center's Terazzo
tile, all 81,000 square feet of it. And that might turn out to be a
greater home advantage for the Kings than Dodger Stadium, with its
clay that settles oh-so-nicely into the baseball's seams,
purportedly has been for L.A. pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in their darkest days, the Kings always could count on a
few thousand hardcore fans for support and sustenance. Their
christening against the Boston Bruins attracted the committed, the
curious and the cliquish, 18,500 fans in all. The Kings did their
best on the ice and behind the scenes to keep them coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake's fourth goal and eighth point tied the game at 1
midway through the second period. The score stayed that way until
the 57th minute when the Bruins scored a goal on a power play.
Juzef Stumpel scored in the penultimate minute to send the game
into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Phantom of the Opera'' star Davis Gaines' singing of the
national anthem to South Park's Cartman spurring the fans on via
the eight-sided video scoreboard, the Kings left no potential fan
base uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Their attention to detail was downright Andy Murray-esque. It
appeared to extend all the way to the weather. After all, what
better place to come in out of the 90-degree heat than a one
million square foot icebox?
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center, with its 55 restrooms, 23 refreshment stands
and two sit-down eateries, could be described as ``unique, dramatic
and full of small touches of luxury and convenience.'' In fact,
those were the exact words used to describe the $16 million Forum
when the Kings christened it on Dec. 30, 1967, in a game against
the Philadelphia Flyers. That night began with owner Jack Kent
Cooke commandeering the spotlight _ as he was wont to do _ to
giddily inform the crowd of 14,366 that it was ``the happiest day''
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings then took a little fizz off the celebration by getting
shut out 2-0. Who knew it wasn't just passes the players with names
like Eddie ``Jet'' Joyal were telegraphing that night?
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing ending was a harbinger of decades to come.
Indeed, it seemed like the only thing left standing tall at the end
of some seasons were the building's 80 white exterior columns.
</P>
<P>
   There were eerie parallels between the openings, then and now.
There was a Van Impe skating for the other team in both instances _
it was Ed in 1967 and his nephew Darren on Wednesday. And both
times the Kings were facing a goaltender that wasn't technically
the other team's best.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers rested Bernie Parent and played his backup, Doug
Favell, after Favell had threatened to retire if his minutes
weren't increased (he responded by stopping 25 Kings shots). On
Wednesday, the Bruins went with Robbie Tallas while their No. 1
netminder, former King Byron Dafoe, remained unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the way the game started. The Kings got knocked
down early Wednesday, the Bruins' Anson Carter scoring the first
goal in the new building in the fifth minute of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind 1967, as recently as last year, that would have sent
the team into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings are a more upbeat, undeterred team under Murray,
their first-year head coach. They settled down after Carter's score
and struck on their third power play. The power play Murray has
made the Kings practice for at least 20 minutes a day since the
opening of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings clearly are moving in the right direction. On this
night of new beginnings, the Stanley Cup appeared, to quote Cooke
quoting former Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, ``as
inevitable as tomorrow. But perhaps not as imminent.'' &QL;

THIS PLACE REALLY KEEPS FANS IN THEIR PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a signpost at the northwest corner of the
Staples Center pointing THIS way to the VIP Entry. There's a
signpost at the southeast corner of Los Angeles' new sports arena
pointing THAT way to the VIP Entry.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bother looking for a door marked VIP Entry. There
isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you really are a VIP, you don't have to ask.
</P>
<P>
   That's life at the Staples Center, where nobody _ VIP or NVIP,
famous or anonymous, rich or poor or in between _ has to ask where
he or she belongs.
</P>
<P>
   If you were one of the $18.50-a-game Kings fans in the top
seating level more than 100 feet above the ice at Wednesday's home
opener against the Boston Bruins, you were in no danger of
accidentally wandering into one of the three luxury-suite levels
below. If you were one of the $200,000- to $300,000-a-year
luxury-suite holders, you weren't about to get mixed up with the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   There are elevators for you and me, serving the main concourse
and the upper concourse and nothing in between. And there are
elevators for the beautiful people, going from the main concourse
to the carpeted suite levels A (the exclusive one), B and C without
risking contact with the real world.
</P>
<P>
   There are hot dog and beverage stands (``Franks and Bev's'') for
you and me. And there's a baseline restaurant featuring linen
napkins and $14 cappuccino ice cream for the suite folks.
</P>
<P>
   There are the seats at the top for you and me. And there are
extra-wide seats at rinkside for the guys with the fat wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Titanic,'' a photographer said to me after his
first, self-guided tour of the building at 11th and Figueroa.
``Total class separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I can't tell you if that's the worst thing that's ever
happened to sports in Los Angeles. It's the price a city pays for a
place for $20 million-a-movie stars to watch $14 million-a-year
athletes perform. Build it and they will spend.
</P>
<P>
   But I can tell you it's new and unnerving if you happen to have
grown accustomed to the Forum over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum didn't even have passenger elevators. It didn't need
them.
</P>
<P>
   There were, essentially, only two levels at the Forum _ three if
you counted Jack Nicholson separately. For the most part, the big
spenders sat among the just-plain-folk. You walked around the
mezzanine between periods and you might have rubbed elbows _
literally _ with the latest Emmy winner or Playmate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nicholson had to walk through the same spilled beer and
peanut shells as the rest of us to get to his limousine.
</P>
<P>
   We were all in it together.
</P>
<P>
   And wasn't that what going to a game was supposed to be about?
Wasn't that why we wanted a pro football team _ a common rooting
interest for a splintered city? Wasn't that a selling point for the
Staples Center _ it would be a $400 million magnet pulling us
together?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Staples Center is built to keep us apart.
</P>
<P>
   There's a nice, democratic touch on the main level, a bronze
wall etched with the names of the 5,000 construction workers who
put all this steel, concrete, drywall and wiring together over the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it's welcome to sports in the 21st century as Los
Angeles keeps pace with Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta and half a
dozen other major cities that dumped perfectly serviceable
basketball and hockey arenas and put up mints.
</P>
<P>
   From the freeway, or from a helicopter, the Staples Center looks
like a just-landed starship, a sight to behold.
</P>
<P>
   From the sidewalk, up close, it looks like an especially large
Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it's a department store for the rich and high-tech.
There are ads suggesting where to buy your telephone service, your
satellite television, your photocopier, your airline tickets and
your electricity. And, of course, your office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see any newspaper ads, but maybe I didn't look hard
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing about the Staples Center that everybody can agree
on is this: It's huge.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to avoid the elevators and walk the stairs, it's
95 steps from street level to the upper concourse. Go up from there
and you're in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite moment of opening night was when one of the purple
ants belted one of the white ants right in front of one of the
striped ants.
</P>
<P>
   It will never be called cozy or charming. Twenty or 30 years
from now, when obsolescence catches up with it, this will not be
the sort of arena (Boston Garden, Chicago Stadium, Montreal Forum)
people shed tears for.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to like the new place. You just don't have to love
it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view from the top of the Staples Center, where if you
ask how much a good seat costs, you can't afford it. &QL;

BABY CHIMP RESTING AT NEW HOME IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY AMY RAISEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Abandoned by her mother at a Florida zoo, the
8-week-old chimpanzee named Zoe arrived at LAX and was resting in
quarantine at the Los Angeles Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoe is tired, she's a sleepy girl,'' said Brenda Irvine,
wildlife curator at Lion Country Safari and Zoe's main keeper since
her birth.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine accompanied the chimp on the flight from Florida and said
Zoe is adjusting well on her first day. ``She's drinking her
bottles and she even went through a laughing phase,'' Irvine said
Wednesday, describing the tendency of chimps to smile broadly when
happy.
</P>
<P>
   All animals new to the zoo must be quarantined to ensure the
health of rest of the animals, according to zoo officials, so Zoe
is expected to be separated from two other young chimps for a
maximum of 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe's August birth at Lion Country Safari in West Palm Beach,
Fla., surprised the staff, since her mother had had tubal ligation
surgery in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring Zoe seemed logical because the Los Angeles Zoo is
raising two other young chimps who were not safe in their
environments with older chimps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to be raised with their own kind, and we have the
space,'' said Lora LaMarca, marketing and public relations director
for the Los Angeles Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine, who was bringing Zoe to her own home at night for the
first two weeks of the chimp's life, will return to Florida
tomorrow. She is confident that this move will be best for the
animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's young and she's resilient,'' Irvine said. ``The older
she got, the more attached she would have become to her keepers, so
this is the right time for this.''
</P>
<P>
   After Zoe's quarantine is lifted, she will meet chimps Jean and
Jake, about five and four months old, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to come back for the introduction stage,'' Irvine
said, ``but I don't know when I'm coming back.'' &QL; 
The young chimps, together with Zoe, will be reintroduced slowly to
the zoo's older chimps, said LaMarca. ``Our plan with all three
babies is to begin to take them up to the adult exhibit and let

STUMPEL'S GOAL SAVES THE NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray knew the
Staples Center would be packed for opening night. But all week he
was a little worried whether his team would show up through all the
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who guided the Kings through a successful seven-game
trip to open the season, had to waited until the second period
Wednesday night against the Boston Bruins to find out. That's when
Rob Blake scored the first Kings' goal in the new building on a
power play.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to see, but almost not good enough. After Sergei
Samsonov beat Kings goalie Stephane Fiset with less than two
minutes left in the game to give Boston a 2-1 lead, Jozef Stumpel
tied the game with just over a minute remaining and the two teams
skated to a 2-2 tie in front of a sellout crowd of 18,111.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown arena, the vision of Kings owners Ed Roski and
Phillip Anschutz, was rocking through most of the third period when
Fiset traded big stops with Boston's Rob Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a half-dozen scoring opportunities late in third
period. The best came when a shot from Ian Laperierre nearly
trickled past Tallas with seven minutes left, but at the last
second Tallas got a glove on the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Boston's Sergei Samsonov fired on a diving Fiset
and hit the post.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days Murray spoke openly about concerns that
opening night at the new arena could be a little overwhelming for
his players. The team had just two practices there and spent more
time wooing season-ticket holders at a Tuesday afternoon luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has missed the playoffs five of the last six
years, the distractions were significant, even if they opened 4-2-1
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings came out sluggish on offense, playing their worst
period of the season in the first. They outshot the Bruins 9-8, but
had very few true scoring opportunities. It didn't help that
Boston, who entered the game 0-5-3, scored the first goal at the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Just 4:12 into the game, Bruins right wing Anson Carter took a
pass from Jonathan Girard in front and beat Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Saturday's 5-4 loss to Edmonton, the Kings regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   They regained their composure midway through the period when
they killed off a five-on-three disadvantage for 33 seconds with
Chris Johnson (hooking) and Garry Galley (boarding) in the penalty
box.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't score until the second, when Blake tied it with a
blast from the point with Boston left wing Steve Heinze in the
penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Luc Robitaille was credited with the goal on a
tip-in of Blake's shot, but replays showed Blake's goal went
through the legs of Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   The play showed the Kings' skill on the first line. Newcomer
Ziggy Palffy, who had three consecutive 40-goal seasons with the
Islanders, has impressed teammates with his all-around game. He
drew the Bruins to him before getting the puck to Blake.
</P>
<P>
   It hadn't been so easy to find the net for the first five games
of the Kings trip. They did not get a point from the second line of
Donald Audette, Bryan Smolinski and Johnson, but Robitaille was
named NHL Player of the Week for scoring seven goals.
</P>
<P>
   The first line disappeared for the final two games in Canada,
where the Kings went 1-1. In the first game, Audette and Smolinski
scored. In the second Johnson had a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Through two periods, Robitaille and Blake had four shots apiece.
The second line combined for seven.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings scored the game opened up, although there were
no more goals in the period.
</P>
<P>
   With 8:01 left in the second, Audette broke in on Tallas and
tried to fire the puck over his right shoulder. It didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Fiset made a sliding stop on a wrist shot in
front by Carter and covered up.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing face off, Johnson broke out of the pack and
sailed up ice on a breakaway. He fired low to the stick side, but
Tallas made the stop.

AN UPHILL BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Martha Wetmore has seen the human misery caused by
floating a boat off a rubber and steel platform. From her perch at
the boat house at Lake Havasu Landing Resort, which she manages,
Wetmore has just about seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago,'' she said, ``a man was yelling at his wife
at the boat launch. He was having trouble launching his boat and he
was taking it out on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, said Wetmore, he barked at her to get in the car and
park it and the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   She got in the car all right, and drove it straight back to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how he or the boat got home. I guess he had
friends,'' said Wetmore.
</P>
<P>
   While most boat-ramp dramas are less melodramatic, the ramps on
any given weekend at local lakes, places like Castaic, Pyramid,
Casitas and Piru, can look like the 101-405 transition at rush
hour, but they don't have to. Most boat-ramp bottlenecks, say
marina managers, are caused by avoidable delays. A few skills, some
common sense and a little etiquette and your trailer rig won't be
someone else's ball and chain.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Perris, near Riverside, with its steeper ramps sees its
share of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five times this summer big RVs have gone out to the ramps,
backed their boats up and the entire RV and boat have gone in,''
said Nick Cuda, store manager at Lake Perris and unofficial
chronicler of trailering tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RVs are so heavy and the ramp is so steep that the tires
lock and the RVs go under. They need to be towed out and usually
sustain flooding damage and water in the gas tank, and that's just
the RV. There is usually damage to the boat as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common boat ramp problems can be classified as
followed: Inexperienced boaters who haven't learned to properly
back a boat up to a boat launch, and disorganized boaters, who
waste !ital!your time loading supplies, fiddling with motors, drain
plugs, Porta Potties and anything else they can think of at the
launch ramp instead of in the parking lot or at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I see happen,'' said Gordon Dumbeck, a sales
associate at Newport Boats Sea Ray in Oxnard, ``is people putting
their boats in the water after forgetting to put their drain plugs
in.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, trailerable boats usually have drain plugs
at the base of their transoms. The plus is removed when the boat is
taken out of the water. If the plugs aren't in when the boat is
launched the next time, you have water coming into the cockpit and
delays as boaters scramble to get the bow tied to the trailer or
stand with a finger in the proverbial dike while said boater's wife
fishes around in the glove compartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell new boat owners to make a checklist,'' said Dumbeck.
Stage the boat in the parking lot and go through it. Most things
can be done !ital!before you put your boat in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumbeck also tells novices trailering to take a morning off
during the week, drive to the nearest boat ramp and practice
backing the trailer when the place is empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a truck or SUV,'' he says, ``lower the tailgate or
raise the back hatch while you back the trailer in, so you can see
things directly. It'll make you less reliant on the mirrors, which
can be confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most damage at boat launches is limited to lost
tempers and missed fishing opportunities, major expense lurks
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   One recurring problem at Lake Havasu, says Wetmore, is boaters
who fail to properly secure the boat trailer to the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The boat and the trailer go down into the water without the car.
Sometimes the boat floats the trailer. Sometimes the trailer wants
to turn turtle. Sometimes everything sinks to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailer will go down the ramp beautifully,'' said Wetmore.
``Hopefully someone's around who can help them fish it out and
secure it to the vehicle. A lot of people get in a hurry and forget
things, and it's not just the beginners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say three times a summer, someone will lose their brakes
and the vehicle, boat and trailer will all go in,'' said Wetmore.
</P>
<P>
   When an elderly couple, who had never been on the water before,
untrailered a boat and proceeded to plow into her gas dock at full
throttle, Wetmore decided it was time to start encouraging boaters
to seek help from more experienced or from workers at the marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to exercise common sense,'' she says. ``If this means
practicing backing your boat into your driveway, do it. And it
never hurts to ask for help if you lack the skills or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things we see could be on `America's Funniest Home
Videos.' We have people in the boat house who put chairs out and
judge boaters on 1-to-10 scale. Some days, it's the best ticket in
town.''
</P>
<P>
   And the entertainment isn't limited to Southern California
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Al Golden of Baltimore was calling on a marina in southern
Maryland and waiting for the owner while he described operating
procedures to some people who had just purchased an outboard
runabout from him. They had already launched the boat, and moved
the trailer, and the brand-new station wagon to which it was
hitched, to a parking lot above the ramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began our conversation,'' said Golden, ``while watching the
ladies go out for a little spin. As they came back toward the
launching ramp, we could see the operator trying to the get the
motor to shift, but had apparently forgotten the part about
throttling back before attempting to shift. Her steering was
absolutely perfect though, and she hit the ramp dead-center. The
boat continued up the ramp and impaled her beautiful new wagon
about dead-center.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BALL AND CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   The boat trailer leads a hard life. How to increase its
longevity: &QL; 
__ Repack wheel bearings and check break linings. &QL; 
__ Shake frame for loose hardware. &QL; 
__ Inspect hitch cup and ball contact. &QL; 
__ Test trailer lights and turn signals, check tires for dry rot
and bald spots, inflate tires to recommended pressure. &QL; 
__ Apply waterproof grease to winch bearings, gears and lock,
keel-roller assembly, bracket pivots and all other moving parts. &QL; 
__ Check safety chain; replace if it's worn anywhere. &QL; 
__ Follow manufacturer guidelines.

FISHING, RAFTING _ KERN RIVER HAS IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KERNVILLE, Calif. _ The signs are everywhere: ``Caution,
fast-moving rapids. Beware of slippery rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the signs do not stop rafters from tackling rapids such as
Limestone Run with its Class II and III runs. They do not stop
swimmers and anglers. And they certainly do not stop Glendora's
Dale Barber and former Azusa resident Dave Young, who consider the
Kern River their home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so peaceful, so quiet,'' said Barber, who tries to make
the drive to the area above Lake Isabella in Kern and Tulare
counties at least once a month. ``You go here and you think about
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing except fish, that is. Nice, shiny rainbow trout,
delivered from a hatchery just downriver in the Kern Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Rafters and swimmers stop anywhere along the river, which flows
past Kernville and into Lake Isabella. But Barber and Young have
their favorite spots along the river, which can become treacherous
in the spring, when the Sierra melt-off breaches the river's banks
and creates fast-flowing rapids that have claimed the lives of
several rafters in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every month, Barber's family fishes next to the Fairview
Campground, 15 miles north of Kernville in the Sequoia National
Forest. There are small pools, few rapids, a tiny motel and market,
a hamburger stand and a popular restaurant that draws almost a full
house on fall weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love it here,'' Young said. ``I just have to have water
nearby when I camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Children ride their bikes along the nearby trails. The Whiskey
Flats, Flynn Canyon, Tobias Creek and Rimdale trails are all found
within a quarter-mile of the campground. Parents target trout and
often release them as soon as they are landed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the campground is situated at about 3,500 feet
elevation, it rarely has snow and remains open year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Many anglers marry light tackle and 4-pound line with salmon
eggs or Panther Martin lures. The river also is renowned for
fly-anglers, as the trout sample such standard patterns as black
wooly buggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We catch things right away,'' Young said. ``If we don't have
anything on our first walk up the river, we're disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anglers also make trips just north of the campground to the
Fairview Dam, which is undergoing renovations. They fish a spot
called the Wall, a cliff face just above the dam. The water usually
is chest-deep there, but on this trip it barely covered an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   For outdoors enthusiasts looking for an escape, the Kern River
presents a lively option. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING . . .
</P>
<P>
   To reach the Kern River, travel the Golden State Freeway (5)
north to the Antelope Valley Freeway (14) north past Mojave to
Highway 178 west. Drive some 35 miles to Sierra Way and continue
north to Kernville. The Kern also can be accessed via I-5 and
Highway 178 through Bakersfield, but that section of 178 has many
more curves.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight spaces are $24 at Fairview Campground or $12 to picnic
for the day. Unlike our local forests, no other day-use parking
permits are required in the Sequoia National Forest. There is ample
parking in front of the Fairview Lodge _ (760) 376-2430 _ and it's
a one-minute walk to reach the river.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in more deluxe accommodations might consider
staying at several hotels and bed-and-breakfast facilities in
Kernville. Information: (760) 376-2629. &QL;

DOLE PAVED WAY TO HER OWN EXIT _ REAL CAMPAIGN NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Elizabeth Dole added a lot more than a skirt and two X
chromosomes to the 2000 presidential free-for-all. Females from 8
to 80 cheered when she got into the ring. But Wednesday, the first
female candidate with a serious shot at the title announced she was
quitting.
<P>
   And it was no surprise: For weeks, there were hints of what was
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said Wednesday that money made the presidential version of
the ``Fight Club'' too rough. But for weeks, maybe months, she has
been perceived as taking the equivalent of a political fall _
failing to run an all-out campaign that aggressively showcased her
strengths and played to her advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she didn't know how: Liddy Dole was the feisty woman
who amassed a truckload of goodwill and a lot of admirers when she
trekked up and down the state on behalf of her husband, Bob, in
1996. She hit the Central Valley in 100-degree heat and wowed them
from the back of pickup trucks, remaining cool as a cuke as she
argued to anyone and everyone about the importance of the Bob Dole
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   She donned leather and straddled the back of a Harley with Jay
Leno to poke fun at her own buttoned-down image.
</P>
<P>
   And when the former Red Cross president made herself candidate,
schoolgirls wrote essays and grandmothers smiled. It was: You go,
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, when it came time to use that gutsy talk on her own
behalf, Dole clammed up. There were too few spontaneous moments.
She gave serious speeches on foreign policy, gun control and
education, but too often, the candidate seemed frozen, her message
stilted.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, she usually appeared to be running, literally running,
from the media. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   __ Dole's last trip to the San Francisco Bay Area two weeks ago,
a visit that looked, like many before it, more like a campaign for
school board president than for the presidency of the United
States: minimal publicity with last-minute media, no in-depth
interviews allowed, no visits to editorial boards to make her case.
She instead offered a brief, 10-minute meeting with reporters in
suburban Burlingame _ the kind of quickie that doesn't allow for
depth or details. Dole mostly took questions about when she was
dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dole's appearance at the California GOP convention in Anaheim
at the end of September, where dozens of reporters sought in vain
to find someone,  &UR; anyone,  &LR; in her campaign to advocate her views
for Sunday stories going to press. Rumors ran rampant that she was
about to quit the race. The candidate was holed up in the hotel and
MIA to the press; when she finally surfaced late at night for her
speech, she took only a few questions before running off. Bad
press.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dole's last major Silicon Valley appearance in June, where
she promised to hold a press conference for reporters and take
their questions on issues like education, taxes and crime. Instead,
she showed up early, answered a few questions and literally tried
to run out on her press conference. Reporters blew up; Dole did
damage control.
</P>
<P>
   The irony: When Dole actually agreed to a rare one-on-one
interviews _ as she did with The Chronicle _ she was substantive
and serious.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded voters about her experience as transportation
secretary and labor secretary _ and how her work in those jobs
affected the lives of average consumers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   And long before George W. Bush made news by suggesting that the
GOP shouldn't support tax cuts ``on the backs of the poor,''
Elizabeth Dole had the guts to be at odds with the right wing of
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those, certainly within my party, who are going to
disagree. But I don't think there should be any special interests
that dominate the party,'' she told The Chronicle. ``Why would any
family need an Uzi or an AK-47 to defend themselves? To me, that's
just common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   When the reaction to Dole's withdrawal came Wednesday, her
former competitors were complimentary, calling her a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   And she was.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole can't blame only money for her failure. The
presidential ``Fight Club'' is tough stuff _ but the knockout
punches are usually self-inflicted.

 VINTNERS MAKE LAST STAND IN FIGHT FOR NET SALES  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the Napa Valley Vintners Association
issued a ``declaration of war'' Wednesday against the alcohol
distribution system, escalating the already pitched battle between
liquor wholesalers and California wineries seeking to ship wine
directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shelton, the chief executive officer of Joseph Phelps
Vineyards and president of the winemakers group, warned wine
wholesalers at a Washington press conference that direct sales over
the Internet are ``a fact of life ... because consumers demand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's comments underscored the winemakers' furious uphill
lobbying campaign against pending legislation that would
significantly strengthen the Prohibition-era system requiring wine,
beer and spirits to be sold through state-licensed wholesalers and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wine wholesalers were quick to lash back, accusing Napa wineries
of fattening their own profits at the expense of wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've hidden behind the guise of small winery access (to
consumers) for years, and at this press conference they made it
clear that this is not about small winery access,'' said David
Dickerson, spokesman for Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America.
``It's about protecting the profits they make on direct
shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for both sides are enormous, as the Internet
threatens to breach traditional commercial barriers between
producers and consumers. Nowhere is that more visible than in the
wine industry, where the barriers are buttressed by state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers contend that the legislation, called the ``21st
Amendment Protection Act,'' is needed to prevent teenagers from
buying alcohol over the Internet and to allow states to enforce
their liquor regulations. Five states have made it a felony to ship
wine directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers charge that the bill, which has passed both the House
and Senate but must be consolidated in its final form, is nothing
but an effort to shield state-protected wholesaler monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton railed against the system Wednesday, likening it to
something ``out of a banana republic.'' He said small wineries
often cannot get their boutique labels on store shelves, and even
when they find a willing wholesaler, some state laws require that
the winery enter a contract to continue doing business with that
wholesaler indefinitely, regardless of performance or even whether
the wholesaler pays its bills.
</P>
<P>
   States that by law ``shackle you to a distributor for life,''
Shelton declared, ``must disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the system archaic and said it ``should not survive
the evolution of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson retorted, ``We believe that following the law will
never be outmoded, and the law says there are specific ways to sell
and distribute alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet still accounts for only a tiny fraction of wine
sales _ under 2 percent at Joseph Phelps, Shelton said. (Limited
direct sales are permitted to some states that have entered into a
mutual pact with California.)
</P>
<P>
   But Shelton said non-Internet direct sales _ from winery tasting
rooms, wine clubs and direct mail, all of which are also sharply
limited by state liquor regulations _ represent a significant
percentage of winery sales, as much as 12 percent at Joseph Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very profitable percentage, I might add,'' Shelton
said, ``and one that's very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineries that sell directly can capture the entire markup on a
bottle of wine rather than sharing it with wholesalers and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, which represents all California vintners, said the
entire industry agrees that the more stringent felony laws and
state-enforced wholesale monopolies need to be combatted.
</P>
<P>
   But in toned-down criticism of the existing distribution system,
he said it needs reform, ``but we're not out to eliminate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any threat to tear down _ as opposed to reform _ the liquor
distribution system is sure to meet with powerful resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor wholesalers are a potent lobbying force, much more widely
represented than wineries on Capitol Hill and in state
legislatures. They also enjoy a close relationship with the House
GOP leadership through David Rehr, the top lobbyist for the
National Beer Wholesalers Association, and a member of the
exclusive ``kitchen cabinet'' that meets regularly with GOP Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley vintners also are seeking to protect their
geographic ``brand'' from large wineries that label their wines
Napa when in fact they come from places such as Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 federal regulation prohibited the practice but
grandfathered in an exception for wineries that were using the Napa
label at the time. Shelton said mass-production wineries can buy a
small label that owns the exemption and then slap the Napa Valley
name on wines that come from more pedestrian regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer finds a $5 bottle of Chardonnay and thinks it's
got to be good because it's from Napa,'' Shelton said. ``We believe
it's consumer fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the chances of getting federal regulators to
lift the exemption are ``a long shot,'' but said vintners are
working on a voluntary ``seal of authenticity'' that vintners could
use to assure consumers that their wines really come from Napa.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``geographic brand'' issue can work both ways. For
years, California vintners have borrowed place names such as
Champagne, Burgundy, Port and even Johannisberg Riesling from
Europe, much to the consternation of vintners in France, Portugal
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Treaties governing the issue will be revisited in the upcoming
World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. The Wine Institute, a
larger trade group that represents all California vintners, is
about to release a white paper exploring the trademark issues to
help determine what position the group will adopt.

BRUINS TIE KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So close, but so far away. The Bruins' first nine
games have been a series of close calls, bad luck, spotty
execution, and acute disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   As coach Pat Burns put it, the Bruins have been mighty close.
But as he said, ``We have to get away from close. Close only counts
in horseshoes, dancing, and hand grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now nine games without a win (0-5-4), tying their mark of
futility from 1964-65. After Wednesday night's 2-2 tie with the Los
Angeles Kings, the club is asking itself what in the world it has
to do to get a win.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like it was over with 2:23 left in regulation. Bruins
left wing Sergei Samsonov, who had his best game of the season,
picked an opportune time to score his first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov skated the puck through the right circle and backhanded
a shot on Kings goalie Stephane Fiset, who made the initial save.
But Samsonov picked up his own rebound, skated across the slot, and
backhanded another shot high over Fiset that the goalie couldn't
get to.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings weren't done. With 1:08 left, former Bruins center
Jozef Stumpel came back to haunt them as he scored with a shot from
the left circle to pull Los Angeles even at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came out of the blocks much better than they had
Saturday against the Phoenix Coyotes. Steve Heinze, who played with
Jason Allison and Anson Carter, tried to redirect an Allison pass
in the game's early moments but it went just wide.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took the lead on a Carter goal at 4:12, his first of the
season. Heinze fired a shot on Fiset that the netminder kicked out.
Allison backhanded the rebound on net, but Fiset stopped that, too.
The Kings tried to clear it, but it ended up right on the stick of
defenseman Jonathan Girard at the left point. Girard took the shot
and Carter tipped it in for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a chance for more during a two-man advantage that
lasted 32 seconds, but they couldn't break through.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the power play, when it was 5 on 4, Samsonov set
up defenseman Kyle McLaren in the left circle after skating right
to left around the net, but it went for naught as Fiset was there.
</P>
<P>
   Boston nearly went up, 2-0, during a shorthanded 2 on 1.
Allison, rushing up the left side, fed a pass across the slot to
Dave Andreychuk, who stuck his stick out and one-handed a shot on
net. But Fiset stopped it with his left pad as Andreychuk barreled
into him in the crease, his stick hitting the goalie in the head.
Fiset was shaken up briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tallas (38 saves) was doing a tremendous job of
holding the fort despite taking a shot off the right ankle from Ken
Belanger during warmups. Tallas could barely walk after the game.
</P>
<P>
   One of his better saves in the first was on defenseman Mattias
Norstrom, whose low shot from the left point just 1:24 into the
game was snared by Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   The second period, especially the last half of it, was entirely
too much of an adventure for Boston, which found itself scrambling
as the Kings' offense began to get fired up.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles tied the game at 1 at 10:32 on a power-play goal by
defensemen Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who had several good opportunities prior to the score,
took a pass at the left point from forward Ziggy Palffy, who
chipped the puck over from the right point. Blake teed it up and
Luc Robitaille set the screen on Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas robbed forward Donald Audette of a goal at 11:59. Glen
Murray, one of several ex-Bruins on the Kings' roster, skated
behind the net and centered a pass to Audette. Audette, off to the
goalie's left, tried to put the puck over Tallas, who was sprawled
on his belly. But somehow, Tallas got his glove up high enough to
snag it.
</P>
<P>
   He had another big test at 13:12 when he faced Palffy on a
shorthanded breakaway, but Palffy made his move first and Tallas
was ready. The save kept the Bruins from getting in a hole as the
Kings outshot them, 6-1, in the last 7:15 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, both teams had chances, with the Kings having more
but Tallas was immense. The Bruins had an opportunity at 5:55 when
Andreychuk backhanded an attempt through the legs of defenseman
Garry Galley, but Fiset made the stop.
</P>
<P>
   Blake hit the post during the power play at 9:19 and Bryan
Smolinski had a point-blank shot at 10:10 that Tallas saved.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a golden opportunity to go ahead at 10:30 when
Samsonov had an open top of the net to shoot at on a rebound and it
went off the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Landon Wilson got to the carom and his shot went off
the crossbar.

NICE PLACE TO CALL HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is a little known fact that they had luxury
suites at the Colosseum in Rome. Ask Chick Hearn if you don't
believe me. They weren't very close to the playing field, either,
for perfectly good reasons having to do with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   They have 160 of them at the new Staples Center, which the Los
Angeles Kings inaugurated sports-wise Wednesday night, along with
hundreds of other amenities humidors, wine cellar, even fireplaces
that the Romans undoubtedly would have given thumbs ups.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not sure whether any of them matter to rank-and-file
hockey fans, who are notoriously easy to please. Give a puckhead a
seat with a view, the freedom to yell, a couple of beers _ OK,
several beers _ and a few good cross-checks, and they're perfectly
content. Throw in a good team and you have a fan for life.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, it's hard to get a true first impression on the
viability of the Staples Center. We may need a Laker game or two,
or a mid-season Kings game against Calgary, to see if it is a stand
alone attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It is without question attractive. I'm not an architectural
critic, but I'll play one here and say that the Staples Center is
the most impressive looking building in downtown Los Angeles south
of the Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   If Staples had been open during the NFL's recent
expansion-city-rape sweepstakes, Houston businessman Robert McNair
might have $700 million burning a hole in his pocket. It shows you
what a little initiative and $375 in PRIVATE money can do.
</P>
<P>
   With cool contours that dominate the eye, it's a terrific
addition to the landscape. The atmosphere outside Staples was a
reminder of how vibrant a downtown arena can be. There are few
feelings as electric as a walk-up crowd milling round a stadium in
the hours before or after a game.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is as much a part of the ambiance at Wrigley Field,
Fenway Park or Camden Yards in Baltimore as the game inside. It's
amazing how energizing it can be to see people walking and
communing. Once the retail area around Staples is built up, it will
be a true destination stop.
</P>
<P>
   You could actually find patrons Wednesday night who had set up a
tailgate in a parking lot a few hundreds yards away from Staples. I
once thought I saw a tailgate party in the Forum parking lot, but
it turned out to be an old couch that someone had dumped and set on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Inside also gives one pause but in both positive and negative
ways. There is more concourse room at Staples than at some
airports, and it works to everyone's advantage. It's nice to be in
a crowd and not necessarily feel like you're in one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forum wasn't particularly intimate for hockey games, and
neither is Staples. The triple deck of luxury suites that ring the
arena serves as a separation between church (the real hockey fans)
and state (those rich enough to afford the real good seats).
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a good look. There should never be seats higher than a
scoreboard, and that's the case for one-third of all seats at
Staples. Disney's renovation of Anaheim Stadium succeeded in adding
suites subtly, but baseball stadiums have advantages that arenas do
not. There may simply not be a good way to put 160 suites in an
arena, and the Kings owners, Ed Roski and Phil Anshutz, needed 160
to build it.
</P>
<P>
   To the credit of the owners and developers, they went the extra
mile in putting a face on the players even if the seats were a
quarter-mile high.
</P>
<P>
   The audio system along the boards was crackling good for those
in the last rows. You could hear checks along the boards, the puck
whizzing along the boards behind the goaltenders, and even the
schuss (SP??) of skates on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Avendano of Whittier has been attending Kings games since
1992, usually sitting in the upper reaches of the Forum colonnade.
His seat Wednesday was in the last row of Section 320, and it cost
his $25. But he liked it more than his old seats at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually better than the Forum,'' he said. ``I can see
the player's faces and hear everything. It's steeper, but I have a
better view.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the true Kings zealot will sit, those who have the
new Kings crest jersey, but also never threw away their old
silver-and-black and purple-and-gold outfits. The true loyalist
moved to the colonnade once the Gretzky era priced them out of the
Forum loge, and has stayed there A.G. (after Gretzky) since the
ticket prices stayed exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, you could scan the lower level and find patches of
empty purple seats. But every seat upstairs was filled, and by the
fans with the loudest lungs. New arena, old habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember about the Forum,'' said legendary Kings
goalie Rogie Vachon, ``was the shape. I had never seen a round
arena before. I look at this, and I don't see anyone topping
Staples for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Can an arena help a team win? ``No,'' said Rogie. ``In the old
days, you could play in a barn and it didn't matter. But it can
definitely be more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Staples is, whether or not you have access to the humidor.

FLEISHER NOT BAD FOR A ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; From amateur whiz to forgettable pro to senior sensation, it
has been a memorable golf career for Bruce Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. Amateur champion, often lost in the crowd during
his two decades on the PGA Tour, is holding off none other than
senior superstar Hale Irwin in a stretch run that could make
Fleisher a triple-crown winner in his first season on the Senior
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year, money champion and Player of the Year _ it's
all within reach for Fleisher, who entered this week No. 1 in
earnings and tied for first in wins _ six _ with Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, who will play in next week's Pacific Bell Senior
Classic at Wilshire Country Club, credits his senior success to a
fast start that eluded him on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``My early years on the PGA Tour were difficult,'' said the 1968
U.S. Amateur champion, who was low amateur in the '69 Masters as a
contemporary of Ben Crenshaw, Lanny Wadkins and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher had high expectations and felt he couldn't miss, but. .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour at that time had Monday qualifying and the guys who
came out of the box fast, like Ben and Lanny, they never looked
back. I came out and struggled trying to make it on Mondays. If you
get beat up early, unless you are strong mentally, it's very
difficult to get back to the other side of the fence. It was very
difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Tour has been a whole different story for the fit
51-year-old, who won two of this year's first three tournaments and
was second in his next two starts. By June, he had four wins and
four other top-five finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, with $1,921,822 in '99, he has eclipsed his career PGA
Tour earnings _ $1.7 million, highlighted by his only win, in the
1991 New England Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher is feeding on his senior momentum, having found success
30 years after he expected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the age of 50, you are on a much more even playing field,''
he said. ``If I live long enough, I might be able to beat Jack
Nicklaus . . . but the point is, I am in the right place at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shark field set: Former Occidental College star Olin Browne,
a 14-year PGA Tour veteran, will make his debut in the Franklin
Templeton Shark Shootout next month, pairing with another notable
newcomer. He and tour Rookie of the Year candidate Carlos Franco
will form one of 12 two-man teams in the Nov. 12-14 Greg
Norman-hosted team competition at Thousand Oaks' Sherwood Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, the most successful Oxy athlete since football speedster
Vance Mueller made the jump from the NCAA Division III Tigers to
the NFL Raiders in 1985, earned the Shark invitation with two wins
in the past 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who had played in just five PGA Tour events before this
year, jump-started his '99 campaign with a strong showing in the
Anderson Consulting World Match Play Championship in February, then
followed with wins in the Compaq Classic of New Orleans and Greater
Milwaukee Open. He entered this week ranked 11th in season earnings
with $1,732,884.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams in the $1.5 million event are defending champions
Norman and Steve Elkington, Fred Couples/David Duval, Ben
Crenshaw/Bruce Lietzke, Peter Jacobsen/John Cook, Chip Beck/John
Daly, Craig Stadler/Tom Kite, Scott McCarron/Scott Hoch, Corey
Pavin/Steve Pate, Duffy Waldorf/Glen Day, Brad Faxon/Jeff Sluman
and Andrew Magee/Jay Haas.
</P>
<P>
   __ Par-3 showdown: Jesper Parnevik will defend his title in the
Sun Microsystems Par-3 challenge Nov. 16 at Four Seasons Aviara
Golf Club in Carlsbad. The made-for-television event, to be
broadcast Thanksgiving Day on Fox Sports Network, includes three
players each from the PGA, LPGA and Senior PGA tours and three
celebrity players.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, Fred Couples and Hal Sutton will represent the PGA and
Nancy Lopez, Kelly Kuehne and Annika Sorenstam the LPGA. Johnny
Miller, Lee Trevino and Chi Chi Rodriguez are expected to be named
as the Senior Tour representatives. Celebrity players have not yet
been selected.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matadors update: Cal State Northridge, which tied for eighth
Tuesday in its Countrywide Invitational at Wood Ranch, continues to
get good play in nearly every match but not by enough individuals
at the same time, according to coach Jim Bracken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't jelled all at the same time,'' Bracken said.
``Every round we've played except for one, we've had at least one
person under par. But it's been different guys every round and we
haven't been consistent. When we're not playing well, we'll shoot
78 or 79. We're going to be good. We still have a lot of
confidence. We've just got to figure out why we're so
inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracken says College of the Desert transfer Paul D'Ambra, who
tied for eighth this week at 5-over-par 221, has been the most
consistent, with a low round of 66 and a stroke average under 73.
The Matadors also have received strong play from freshman Scott
Bashin, the ex-Birmingham High whiz who qualified for this year's
state amateur in his first attempt. He tied for 16th at Wood Ranch
with the help of a second-round 69.

BASSO'S SEASON IS NO CHICKEN FEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About the only thing to stop USC's Allen Basso
this season is bad chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I get,'' Basso said of his bout with salmonella
poisoning last weekend in Stockton. ``No more chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Water polo opponents would be wise to force-feed Basso more
fowl. The Trojans' senior driver has been making everyone else in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation sick. Basso, a returning
All-American, leads the conference with a career-high 36 points (30
goals, six two-point goals), or twice as many points as anyone else
on the team. He also has been named MPSF Player of the Week twice,
including two weekends ago when he scored a two-point goal against
Stanford in overtime to send the Trojans into the NorCal Tournament
final.
</P>
<P>
   USC then beat UCLA to assume the top spot in the U.S. Water Polo
poll. After victories over Pacific and UC Davis last weekend (in
which Basso scored just two goals thanks to the chicken), the
Trojans (14-1, 3-0) remained No. 1 heading into Saturday's home
match with No. 3-ranked Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't like he has come out of nowhere. Basso is a fifth-year
senior who earned All-American honorable mention last year when the
Trojans won the national championship (he scored 25 points despite
a partially torn elbow ligament). He also was voted team captain
his sophomore and junior seasons _ after hardly playing as a
redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   His success stems from USC's depth. The Trojans have five
returning All-Americans, and teams can't guard everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Basso's dominance came at a key time because top scorer Marko
Pintaric graduated. Someone had to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Jovan Vavic) wants someone to seize the
opportunities,'' Basso said. ``I'm a good shooter, so he's given me
the green light more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lonzo wins award: Basso's reign as MPSF Player of the Week
ended when Pepperdine's Greg Lonzo won the award with a six-goal,
eight-point weekend in the Waves' victories over Cal and UC Santa
Barbara. Lonzo has 30 points (24 goals, three 2-point goals),
placing him third in the MPSF behind Basso and Long Beach State's
Cory Dolley.
</P>
<P>
   __ Simmonds honored: Cal soccer player Kendall Simmonds, a Royal
High graduate, earned MPSF Player of the Week honors after he
scored two game-winning goals against Sacramento State and No.
1-ranked Santa Clara to extend his team's unbeaten streak to seven
matches (6-0-1). The Bears returned to the National Soccer Coaches
Association poll with the victories. Simmonds has just three goals
this season, but all are game-winners.
</P>
<P>
   __ Showdown in WCC: Pepperdine's women's volleyball team,
leading the West Coast Conference with a 14-1, 5-0 record, travels
to Santa Clara this weekend for a key conference matchup. Santa
Clara traditionally presents unique challenges to Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Toso Pavilion, where Santa Clara plays, doesn't have a permanent
roof. Instead it's enclosed in a white, air-supported roof similar
to the Metrodome in Minneapolis and the material that encloses
swimming pools in the winter back east. Pepperdine coach Nina
Matthies calls it a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to play in,'' Matthies said. ``We handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Waves have had success there, going 8-6 in 14
matches. Santa Clara swept 15-9, 15-12, 15-11 last season, but with
middle blocker Jamie Hill, setter Melissa Plass and outside hitter
Stacy Rouwenhorst among the conference's hitting leaders, the
chances look better. A victory would give Matthies her 300th career
victory (she's 299-213 now).
</P>
<P>
   Also, San Diego beat Santa Clara last weekend. Pepperdine won at
San Diego Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for it to be the toughest match,'' Matthies said.

FLORIDA LANDS HERALDED QB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Brock Berlin, perhaps the nation's best
high school quarterback, recently announced his decision to play
for Steve Spurrier at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that Spurrier will keep the two-quarterback
system for the next four years?
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Berlin, who plays for nationally
top-ranked Shreveport Evangel Christian, made his announcement at
the First Assembly of God in Shreveport, La., which is custom for
players at the school. He chose the Gators over Kentucky, Georgia,
LSU and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin is the type of quarterback good programs are built
around. He completed 656 of 955 passes for 5,488 yard with 108
touchdowns during his first two seasons and is 144 of 246 for 2,082
yards and 20 touchdowns through seven games this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other happening include:
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will receive a visit from one of the nation's best
receivers -- Charlie Rogers (6-4, 185) from Saginaw, Mich. Rogers,
who has drawn comparisons to Randy Moss because of his size and
speed - also has trips planned to Tennessee and Florida State and
will probably also visit Michigan and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has received a commitment from running back Albert
Tuipulotu (6-1, 250) of San Mateo Community College. He was part of
the Huskies 1997 class but left after three games that year. He'll
have two years of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lost out on one of the state's best offensive linemen
when Eddie Keele (6-4, 285) gave a commitment to BYU. Oregon had
also offered a scholarship to Keele.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Mackey (6-0, 180) of Bakersfield High picked Colorado over
Nebraska, Arizona, Arizona State and Washington. Mackey was a prep
teammate of USC freshman linebacker Aaron Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona received a commitment from running back Anthony Fulcher
(6-1, 180) of Scottsdale Horizon. His father, Mark, was an option
quarterback at Arizona in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's best defensive linemen, Nathan Goodson (6-5,
255) of Temescal Canyon, has his choices narrowed to USC, Arizona,
UCLA, Washington and Cal. He visited Arizona on Sept. 18 and has
trips planned to USC (Dec. 3) and Cal (Dec. 10). USC and Arizona
are the two favorites as of now.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Margarita quarterback Chris Rix and San Diego Mira Mesa
teammates Amon Gordon and Teyo Johnson were among the recruits
visiting Florida State last weekend. Rix, who transferred from
Bishop Amat and helped Santa Margarita beat his old teammates on
Friday, committed to the Seminoles before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Johnson, who both transferred to Mira Mesa from
Everett, Wash., have yet to decide and could end up at the same
school. Gordon, a 6-foot-4, 250-pound running back-linebacker also
has trips planned to USC (Dec. 3) and Michigan (Dec. 10).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 6-foot-6, 242-pound tight end, is highly sought after
in football and basketball. His first love is basketball, but he
wants to play both in college. He visited Houston on Oct. 9 and is
also considering a number of other schools, including USC, UCLA and
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based recruiting analyst Tom Lemming's choices of the
nation's top recruiters in alphabetical order: Tim Cassidy (Texas
A&AMP;M); Jim Collins and Bob Sanders (Florida); Bill Conley (Ohio
State); Ronnie Cottrell (Alabama); Rodney Garner (Georgia); Danny
Hope (Purdue); Rob Ianello (Arizona); Greg Mattison (Notre Dame);
Larry Petroff (USC); Dave Roberts (South Carolina).

NICE PLACE TO CALL HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is a little known fact that they had luxury
suites at the Colosseum in Rome. Ask Chick Hearn if you don't
believe me. They weren't very close to the playing field, either,
for perfectly good reasons having to do with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   They have 160 of them at the new Staples Center, which the Los
Angeles Kings inaugurated sports-wise Wednesday night, along with
hundreds of other amenities humidors, wine cellar, even fireplaces
that the Romans undoubtedly would have given thumbs ups.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not sure whether any of them matter to rank-and-file
hockey fans, who are notoriously easy to please. Give a puckhead a
seat with a view, the freedom to yell, a couple of beers _ OK,
several beers _ and a few good cross-checks, and they're perfectly
content. Throw in a good team and you have a fan for life.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, it's hard to get a true first impression on the
viability of the Staples Center. We may need a Laker game or two,
or a mid-season Kings game against Calgary, to see if it is a stand
alone attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It is without question attractive. I'm not an architectural
critic, but I'll play one here and say that the Staples Center is
the most impressive looking building in downtown Los Angeles south
of the Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   If Staples had been open during the NFL's recent
expansion-city-rape sweepstakes, Houston businessman Robert McNair
might have $700 million burning a hole in his pocket. It shows you
what a little initiative and $375 in PRIVATE money can do.
</P>
<P>
   With cool contours that dominate the eye, it's a terrific
addition to the landscape. The atmosphere outside Staples was a
reminder of how vibrant a downtown arena can be. There are few
feelings as electric as a walk-up crowd milling round a stadium in
the hours before or after a game.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is as much a part of the ambiance at Wrigley Field,
Fenway Park or Camden Yards in Baltimore as the game inside. It's
amazing how energizing it can be to see people walking and
communing. Once the retail area around Staples is built up, it will
be a true destination stop.
</P>
<P>
   You could actually find patrons Wednesday night who had set up a
tailgate in a parking lot a few hundreds yards away from Staples. I
once thought I saw a tailgate party in the Forum parking lot, but
it turned out to be an old couch that someone had dumped and set on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Inside also gives one pause but in both positive and negative
ways. There is more concourse room at Staples than at some
airports, and it works to everyone's advantage. It's nice to be in
a crowd and not necessarily feel like you're in one.
</P>
<P>
   But the Forum wasn't particularly intimate for hockey games, and
neither is Staples. The triple deck of luxury suites that ring the
arena serves as a separation between church (the real hockey fans)
and state (those rich enough to afford the real good seats).
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a good look. There should never be seats higher than a
scoreboard, and that's the case for one-third of all seats at
Staples. Disney's renovation of Anaheim Stadium succeeded in adding
suites subtly, but baseball stadiums have advantages that arenas do
not. There may simply not be a good way to put 160 suites in an
arena, and the Kings owners, Ed Roski and Phil Anshutz, needed 160
to build it.
</P>
<P>
   To the credit of the owners and developers, they went the extra
mile in putting a face on the players even if the seats were a
quarter-mile high.
</P>
<P>
   The audio system along the boards was crackling good for those
in the last rows. You could hear checks along the boards, the puck
whizzing along the boards behind the goaltenders, and even the
schuss (SP??) of skates on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Avendano of Whittier has been attending Kings games since
1992, usually sitting in the upper reaches of the Forum colonnade.
His seat Wednesday was in the last row of Section 320, and it cost
his $25. But he liked it more than his old seats at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually better than the Forum,'' he said. ``I can see
the player's faces and hear everything. It's steeper, but I have a
better view.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the true Kings zealot will sit, those who have the
new Kings crest jersey, but also never threw away their old
silver-and-black and purple-and-gold outfits. The true loyalist
moved to the colonnade once the Gretzky era priced them out of the
Forum loge, and has stayed there A.G. (after Gretzky) since the
ticket prices stayed exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, you could scan the lower level and find patches of
empty purple seats. But every seat upstairs was filled, and by the
fans with the loudest lungs. New arena, old habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember about the Forum,'' said legendary Kings
goalie Rogie Vachon, ``was the shape. I had never seen a round
arena before. I look at this, and I don't see anyone topping
Staples for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Can an arena help a team win? ``No,'' said Rogie. ``In the old
days, you could play in a barn and it didn't matter. But it can
definitely be more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Staples is, whether or not you have access to the humidor.

FIT FOR THE KINGS
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ New Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray knew the
Staples Center would be packed for opening night. But all week he
was a little worried whether his team would show up.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of glitter, plenty of celebrities, plenty of
people wondering Wednesday night if these were the same old Kings
wearing a brand new crown.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's fears came true, but it is not the score that will be
remembered about the first game played in the Kings' new arena.
</P>
<P>
   They admitted they didn't join the fun until the final two
minutes of regulation when Jozef Stumpel scored to give the Kings a
2-2 tie against the Boston Bruins in front of a sellout crowd of
18,111, the largest hockey crowd in California history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were plenty of nerves early in the game, but we settled
ourselves down,'' said captain Rob Blake, who tied the game in the
second period with a power-play goal. ``There was a lot of
excitement tonight and we got caught up in it. But it was a great
to come back and get a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel tied the game with 1:03 left, less than a minute after
Boston's Sergei Samsonov beat Kings goalie Stephane Fiset to give
the Bruins the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Boston (0-5-4) would have its first victory of the
season. But the Kings came back. Could it have been that old
Staples Center magic?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've opened five buildings this year,'' said Bruins winger
Kyle McLaren, whose team also played the first game in Colorado's
Pepsi Center. ``They were going to be nervous. I think in the first
period they were sitting on their heels, warming up. I felt they
came out stronger from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who guided the Kings to a 4-2-1 record on their
seven-game trip to open the season, had to wait until the second
period for his team to catch its breath.
</P>
<P>
   And the downtown arena, the vision of Kings owners Ed Roski and
Phillip Anschutz, was rocking through most of the third period when
Fiset traded big stops with Boston's Rob Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had a half-dozen scoring opportunities late in third
period and finished outshooting the Bruins 40-30. The best chance
came Ian Laperierre nearly trickled a shot past Tallas with seven
minutes left, but at the last second Tallas got a glove on the
puck.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Samsonov fired on a diving Fiset and hit the
post.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of the same in overtime, when both teams had several
scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I will remember about this game was all the chances
we had,'' Stumpel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, Murray spoke openly about concerns that
opening night at the new arena could be a little overwhelming for
his players. The team had just two practices there and spent more
time wooing season-ticket holders at a Tuesday-afternoon luncheon
than actually working out.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has missed the playoffs five of the last six
years, the distractions were significant even if there was plenty
of optimism during the first trip.
</P>
<P>
   Just 4:12 into the game, Bruins right wing Anson Carter took a
pass from Jonathan Girard in front and beat Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Saturday's 5-4 loss to Edmonton, the Kings regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   They regained their composure midway through the period when
they killed off a five-on-three disadvantage for 33 seconds with
Chris Johnson (hooking) and Garry Galley (boarding) in the penalty
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play in a new building you want to do more,''
Donald Audette said. ``A lot of guys were a little nervous. We kind
of told each other to relax and play our game. You want to win it,
you want to win every game, but to come back in the third period,
we'll take that point.''

 YOU DESERVE A BREAK-IN TODAY: McBANDIT SAWS THROUGH ROOFS
OF  McDONALD'S 
 &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He's as slick as a greasy french fry. And after
chopping through the ceilings of at least 35 fast-food restaurants
_ mostly McDonald's _ from coast to coast, the polite young thief
nicknamed ``the Rooftop Robber'' is frying the nerves of police
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Terrifying, he's not. At least so far.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the reactions of frustrated detectives and
bemused victims from the San Francisco Bay Area all the way to
Virginia, this bandit with a taste for guns and saws is pushing for
the title of most original bad guy of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never even heard of anything like it before,'' said one
clerk who was about to start her morning shift at the Chilpancingo
Parkway McDonald's in Pleasant Hill, Calif., in August when the
``Rooftop Robber'' dropped in _ through the ceiling. ``He wiped
himself off when he got to the floor, was real polite the whole
time, and then told us, `Can you please get in the freezer?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't frightened, because he was so soft-spoken,'' said the
clerk, who said company policy prevented her from giving her name.
``It was all pretty weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that having a nickname makes what he does cute, police weary
of the mounting publicity say.
</P>
<P>
   The rooftop ripoff artist has knocked over restaurants in five
states _ always after closing time _ taking anywhere from $200 to
$2,000 each time, and he changes locations so fast he seems
unstoppable. He genteelly hands sweaters to his victims as he herds
them into meat lockers, softly says ``please'' and ``thank you'' as
he scoops the cash into a bag, and saunters away with a cheery
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   At one McDonald's in Benicia, Calif., in July, the prolific
robber even paused his getaway stroll to call police and tell them
he left a pack of people in the freezer. He waves a semiautomatic
pistol, and he gingerly put a bullet in a computer for effect once.
So far, nobody has been injured.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, those who hunt him say. ``This guy is
dangerous, and the nature of what he is doing is very violent,''
said Dan Connelly, a police detective from Pleasant Hill, Calif.
``I wouldn't relax one bit on him. We want him off the streets now
before someone gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly had to acknowledge, however, that the hoodlum has
cooked up a criminal game the detective hasn't seen before: ``I've
been at this a long time, but never seen an M.O. like this. It's
strange, I'll say that.''
</P>
<P>
   The robber began his binge at a McDonald's in Folsom, Calif.,
last Thanksgiving, knocking over restaurants all over the West at
will. From the start, he has had the same pattern: cutting through
the roof, then waiting in the space above the ceiling to strike
when workers come on shift. He headed East two months ago before
popping up again in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest count at the state Department of Justice shows he has
robbed restaurants in at least 18 communities in California, most
in the northern part of the state, and five more in Oregon and
Nevada. That is not counting the jobs he pulled in Virginia and
North and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's alone has been hit at least 23 times _ so many that
the company is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to
his capture. The bandit's other unlucky hosts have included Burger
King restaurants _ plus a couple Toys R Us and Blockbuster Video
stores, as if to vary his thieving appetite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitting so many places so fast in so many areas that
we're having a hard time even keeping count,'' said state
Department of Justice Special Agent Martin Horan. ``We're hoping he
screws up before too long so somebody catches him.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest heist, in Rancho Cordova, was just like the others.
He hacked through the roof of the McDonald's restaurant on Sunrise
Boulevard after closing time, waited for the morning shift, and
descended on the stunned workers as they fired up the grills.
</P>
<P>
   Then he calmly shooed everyone into the meat freezer, cleaned
out the cash registers and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The bandit is described as a white male, 5 feet 10 inches tall,
weighing about 150 pounds, in his early 20s and having brown hair.
He always wears a black ski mask, bandanna or a dust mask over his
face, and he carries a bag filled with saws, drills and ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got us stumped, all right,'' said Sergeant C.M. Mise of
the police department in Raleigh, N.C., where the Rooftop Robber
knocked over a McDonald's in September. ``We were hoping you folks
out there would get lucky and get him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what police in California have in mind. ``We always
get our guy, and somewhere, somehow, this one will make a wrong
move, too,'' said Dublin, Calif., Police Sgt. Greg Ahern, who has
been chasing leads since the bandit hit a McDonald's on Dublin
Boulevard in August. ``A bad guy, even with a funny name, is still
just a bad guy.''

   TOKYO _ The drastic restructuring Nissan Motor Co.'s executives
announced on Oct. 18 is aimed to eliminate excess production
capacity and focus its financial and personnel resources on its
main business: making cars.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called the Nissan Revival Plan in the presentation
by Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief operating officer, will close five
domestic factories and will sell off non-automotive sectors such as
its ship- and aerospace-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the executives said, Nissan will be able to
eliminate 21,000 jobs and trim its operating costs by 1 trillion
yen ($9.5 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Three auto assembly plants are to be closed by March 2001 and
the other two plants, which make engines, will be closed by March
2002.
</P>
<P>
   They include three automobile assembly plants, the Murayama
plant in Musashi-Murayama, Tokyo; Kyoto plant in Uji, Kyoto, and
the Minato plant in Nagoya, and an engine plant at Kurihama, in
Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, and an engine plant at its Kyushu
facilities in Kanda, Fukuoka Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto plant is operated by Nissan Shatai Corp., a Nissan
affiliate, and the Minato plant is operated by Aichi Machine
Industry Co., another affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The closings will reduce the number of automobile assembly
plants in Japan to four, from seven.
</P>
<P>
   Those that remain are the Tochigi plant in Kaminokawa, Tochigi
Prefecture; Oppama plant in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture; the
Kyushu plant; and the Shonan plant in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa
Prefecture. The Shonan plant is also operated by Nissan Shatai.
</P>
<P>
   In the three car assembly plants to be closed, however, some
small-scale production activity will be retained, including a
microbus production line at the Kyoto plant. Some parts
manufacturing and body panel presses will be retained at the
Murayama and Minato plants, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the properties involved in the plant closings will be
sold, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant closings will bring the work force at Nissan and
affiliated companies to about 127,000, a reduction of about 21,000,
or 14 percent of its current work force of 148,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21,000, 4,000 jobs will be cut in the manufacturing
sector while 6,500 will be reduced by the integration of sales
agents and other marketing-related sectors, with 6,000
administrative job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Five thousand jobs will be eliminated through selling off Nissan
businesses not involved in automobile activities. Those businesses
include forklift manufacture, ship-related projects and production
of rockets for the Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the dramatic restructuring will trim 1
trillion yen from Nissan's operating costs by fiscal 2002, and will
bring down the debt on which it pays interest to about 700 billion
yen, from 1.4 trillion yen now.
</P>
<P>
   Katsuhiko Hagiwara, chairman of the Nissan labor union,
responding to the announcement, said, ``There are no other ways
except to deal with our management realistically.'' &QL;

   DHEISHEH, West Bank _ Tapping into the Internet's ability to
abolish distances and knock down frontiers, Palestinian refugees
have begun a virtual gathering of exiles.
</P>
<P>
   A project called Across Borders is trying to bring together the
3.6 million-strong Palestinian diaspora, scattered across the
Middle East for the past 50 years, through a network of computer
centers and World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dheisheh became the first online refugee camp a couple of months
ago, and camps in Gaza, Lebanon and Jordan are expected to hook up
to the Net in the future. Birzeit University is the coordinator for
the project, which is funded by contributions from aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the project _ two West Bank Palestinians who
have spent part of their time in exile in the United States and
Australia, Muna Muhaisen and Adam Hanieh _ say they hope refugees
will use the immediacy of the Internet to let their political
demands be heard loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   But by bringing computer technology to low-tech, run-down camps,
the project may ultimately prove more successful at introducing
Palestinian children to the wonders of the modern world than at
bolstering the Palestinian refugee cause.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Israel, a technologically advanced society with a
per-capita gross domestic product 10 times that of the
Palestinians, the West Bank and Gaza look like technological
wastelands.
</P>
<P>
   There are Internet cafes in most large towns of the West Bank
and Gaza, but only 20 percent of households had telephone lines in
1997, and a mere 4 percent had computers, according to the
Palestinian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dheisheh computer center was inaugurated in July,
only a handful of the camp's 10,000 residents had access to
computers. Now, for 6 shekels ($1.40) an hour, anyone with a bit of
training can surf the Web on one of the center's 14 computers
donated by the Canada Fund and other aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Across Borders encourages people to post news items and essays
and bits of oral history on the camp's Web site. But most of the
activity at the computer center _ where screen savers say
``Palestine'' _ has nothing to do with identity or politics.
</P>
<P>
   Children flock to the computer monitors to play games in which
they destroy imaginary enemies, not to mull over real-life
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of being introduced to the concept of a computer
mouse, boys were visiting the Web site of their favorite soccer
player, Ronaldo, and downloading pictures of National Basketball
Association (NBA) celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Free computer classes for children and adults are intended to
ensure that as many people as possible will use the camp's computer
resources.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a student has done research on cloning, a hairdresser
has surfed the Web for new hairdos, and a carpenter has downloaded
designs, but by and large, ``not many people are aware of all that
there is on the Internet,'' said Jamal Abdulkareem, Dheisheh's
33-year-old Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors and peer pressure in the computer room are supposed
to keep sites that mention sex, drugs and other topics offensive to
the community off limits.
</P>
<P>
   But at the center one recent day, a teenager quietly read an
innocent-looking, all-text Web page devoted to the merits of Viagra
_ seeming to suggest that walls will fall faster than the project's
founders imagine.
</P>
<P>
   To refugees, virtual travel is one of the Internet's most
tangible benefits. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot visit
compatriots in the Gaza Strip 110 kilometers (70 miles) away on the
Mediterranean coast unless they obtain hard-to-get permits from
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're unable to go to picnics, unable to go to the sea,
unable to go to movies in Jerusalem, it's like being in a prison
cell,'' said Mrs. Muhaisen, a 39-year-old Palestinian-American
journalist who is one of the project's main architects. ``Your
world becomes very limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Muhaisen was born in Jerusalem but lost her residency
rights during her parents' time in exile. The Internet provides her
with a ``way out'' of the 1-square-kilometer camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's Web site is geared toward young Palestinians who have
spent all their lives in camps. A section called ``Villages of
1948'' ensures that children know where their family homes were _
even though those villages have mostly been torn down or
incorporated into Israeli cities by now.
</P>
<P>
   A section devoted to ``Martyrs'' commemorates the camp residents
who died during the intifada, the Palestinian uprising that started
in the late 1980s. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web's wealth of information is important to many
Palestinians, with local media still heavily censored by the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not happy about what is happening to them, but they
need information,'' said Mrs. Muhaisen. She hopes alternate sources
of information will help refugees forget daily troubles such as
water shortages, blackouts and unemployment and focus on their
struggle to return to their former homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bookmarks on the Dheisheh computer center's machines link to a
wide range of Arabic newspapers online, representing all sorts of
political opinions _ including opposition to the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority does not tolerate criticism and
frequently shuts down newspapers and arrests journalists who
express dissent. But so far, unlike other authoritarian regimes in
the Middle East, it has not tried to block or filter access to the
Internet. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 950.) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next camp wired is scheduled to be Khan Yunis in the Gaza
Strip at the end of November. The computer center there will be
funded through a $48,000 grant by Oxfam, the British charity
organization, according to Hanieh.
</P>
<P>
   After that will come Shatila camp in Lebanon, perhaps by
December.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's Web site is at: www.dheisheh.acrossborders.org. &QL;

   BANGKOK _ When top executives from stock markets around the
world sat down for a discreet closed-door discussion in Bangkok
this week the most recurrent theme was not recent market turmoil,
but the dangers of unregulated markets springing up on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of alternative systems for on-line electronic
trading kept popping up everywhere,'' said Gerrit de Marez Oyens,
secretary-general of the Federation International des Bourses de
Valeurs, which includes members representing 97 percent of the
world's market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern from traditional markets is that electronic
stock trading networks will dilute the inherent worthiness of stock
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization led by de Marez Oyens, known as FIBV, has a
membership that includes global players like the main markets in
London, Tokyo and New York, along with exchanges in developing
markets such as Lima, Tehran, Bangkok and Ljubljana, Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives from markets around the world expressed
fear that unchecked growth of unlinked, Internet-based markets
could fragment, undermine and dilute the value of stock prices
worldwide, de Marez Oyens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock trading could turn into an experience like shopping for
silk in a Thai market: an individual transaction that is completely
untransparent,'' de Marez Oyens said, referring to Internet stock
trading companies as ``parasitical services'' that exploit
regulatory investments made by traditional stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock markets pay for regulation, so why shouldn't the
parasites?'' de Marez Oyens said, noting that the New York Stock
Exchange employs a full-time staff of 500 regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulations make for a protected and orderly environment that
ensures transparency, fairness and people getting paid in time,''
he said. ``Most of these electronic trading companies probably
don't have a single person looking into regulatory issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So far there is only a fledgling group of U.S.-based electronic
stock trading networks, known as ECNs, whose users trade stock
outside traditional markets. These markets are small and unlinked,
which critics say can result in different prices for the same
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the explosive growth of on-line stock trading _ an
electronic extension of traditional markets, for now _ indicates
that ECNs, too, could prove wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that the discounts offered by on-line trading
services have been a democratizing force that has helped bring many
individual investors into the market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional markets have often failed to exploit opportunities
on the Internet, and in some cases entry costs for investors have
remained high, de Marez Oyens acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not enough to just call on-line companies
parasites,'' he said. ``We need to concentrate on why these
companies have been sprouting up and why their market share is
growing and where the traditional markets missed the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, de Marez Oyens said, nobody benefits if competing
ECNs make users unable to know the real price for a stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a drink at the bar and discover you paid ten bucks
more than your friend who bought the same stock almost at the same
time, you feel ripped off,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quickest solution, he added, is to allow on-line trading
systems to register as stock exchanges. ``If they are regulated
like stock exchanges, then traditional markets can compete with
them fairly for the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Internet, the demutualization under consideration by
44 of the FIBV's 52 members _ with several considering public stock
offerings _ will be a major force pushing for more
consumer-oriented stock markets, de Marez Oyens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users are not bound by membership rules or susceptible to peer
pressure,'' he said. ``It brings in a whole new culture when you
are forced to offer high-quality services at the lowest possible
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased awareness of consumer needs should help traditional
exchanges capture certain aspects of the business currently offered
by electronic trading networks, de Marez Oyens added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently we have left behind our business somewhere because
many of these alternative trading services actually offer the same
things we offered in the past.'' &QL;

 c.1999 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QINGDAO, China _ A hot, sun-drenched summer day. Vines in neat,
disciplined rows climb the hillside behind you, the grapes ready to
be harvested, crushed and fermented in great barrels inside the
sprawling, whitewashed buildings below. Meanwhile, you admire the
wine, clear gold and deep purple, over a simple, delicious local
meal.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a scene anywhere in France, California's Napa
Valley or South Australia. Except that this is the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Years of experiments have led to breakthroughs on the Shandong
Peninsula, whose climate is uniquely suitable in Asia for
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   During China's Tang Dynasty, grape wine was imported from
Central Asia, where small amounts of port-like wine are still made
_ ``rooster's heart'' and ``cow's udder'' being two indigenous
varietals.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's climate, however, is generally inhospitable to
viniculture. Wine grapes need long days to ripen and dryness to
concentrate their juice; they are also very sensitive to cold.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's pervasive humidity and low latitudes present almost
insurmountable challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Shandong. The province stretches to the south of Beijing,
then juts out toward Korea, dividing the Gulf of Bohai from the
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean moderates the Siberian winters, while the northerly
latitude (similar to San Francisco's) and low summer humidity _ a
steady 60 percent _ allows temperate fruits like apples and
peaches, for which Shandong is famous, to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The first to recognize this potential was Zhang Bishi, a Qing
Dynasty official who founded the Chang Yu Winery near Yantai in
1892. Zhang brought vines from Europe and appointed Yantai's
Austrian consul as winemaker, but the winery today mostly makes a
localized kind of vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   The real trailblazer was an Englishman named Michael Parry, who
founded the Huadong Winery. Parry came to Hong Kong in 1973 as an
accountant, and drifted through a series of jobs before ending up
in the wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   As China started opening up after 1978, Parry became consumed
with the dream of producing first-class wine in China. In 1982 he
discovered the Shandong Peninsula, and with his partner Gabriel Tam
started convincing the local farmers to plant grapes where, in
marginal soil conditions, they had been growing sweet potatoes and
peanuts. In 1985, they planted 42,000 cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, a typhoon destroyed the vineyard, but
Parry persisted and replanted. By 1986, he was producing chardonnay
and riesling with the help of winemakers from California and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, having put up $1 million of his own
money, Parry went bankrupt and his stake (the joint-venture partner
was state-owned Tsingtao Winery) went to Hiram Walker, itself soon
bought by the British spirits company Allied-Domecq.
</P>
<P>
   Parry stayed on as adviser but his heart was broken. He died of
cancer two years later at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   His photograph hangs prominently at the winery's office _ a
giant of a man, with the glow of the bon vivant. His ashes are
buried on a hill overlooking the vineyard, and the farmers tend
reverently to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Huadong Winery sits among 14 hectares (35 acres) of a
steep, sun-facing basin in the Laoshan Mountains, 40 kilometers (25
miles) from Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape is sublime _ severe, forbidding crags soaring
above green summer fields. In the Chinese way of looking at things,
it's definitely Northern majesty, not Southern mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use this vineyard as a nursery,'' says George Zhao, the
winery's commercial manager. ``We sell cuttings all over the place
_ even Ningxia, Sichuan. People are planting vineyards all over
China.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also used to experiment with varieties like pinot noir and
gamay. Huadong's white wines, however, come from a larger vineyard,
400 hectares of chardonnay and riesling 120 kilometers to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soil is limy, sandy gravel,'' Zhao says. ``Useless for
most crops, but perfect for white wines.'' He adds that the
microclimate strongly resembles that of the region of France that
produces Beaujolais. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parry built the winery as a family residence, with living
quarters upstairs. They've since added a warehouse and cellar _ and
are building a guesthouse. ``Wine tourism,'' Zhao says, '' is the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about Huadong is how good their best
wines are. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The riesling is refreshing and aromatic, in the Alsatian style,
while the mildly oaked chardonnay is subtle and complex, almost
flinty like a chablis, more Burgundy than California.
</P>
<P>
   The red produced for the domestic market is forgettable, but the
winery is planning to produce a cabernet franc _ used in reds from
Touraine and Anjou in France _ from the 1999 vintage, and samples
from the barrel taste promising. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising because other Chinese wineries barely produce
anything recognizable as wine, much less good wine. Most of it,
anyhow, is drunk with Sprite or other mixers by status-conscious
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Chinese-owned Great Wall, Dragon Seal (a
joint-venture with Pernod-Ricard) and, the best of the lot,
Dynasty, a joint venture with Remy-Cointreau in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in 1980 as only the second joint venture in mainland
China, Dynasty produces small amounts of premium chardonnay that is
at least drinkable. Huadong says it's made with their surplus
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own our own vineyards just for that reason,'' says Lin
Keqiang, Huadong's general manager, ``to control the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, he says, is lack of government regulation.
``There are no AOC laws, no quality control. `Wine' only legally
needs to be 70 percent grape juice!''
</P>
<P>
   Li Peng's 1995 decree replacing baijiu, Chinese grain spirit,
with wine at banquets just led to officials drinking shots of wine
``down the hatch,'' like baijiu. Other obstacles include lack of
refrigerated storage.
</P>
<P>
   However erratic their support, Beijing does back the fledgling
wine industry, which after all produces a high-value product from
impoverished soils, not to mention freeing up scarce grain from
baijiu production and promoting healthier drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Duty on imported wine is 70 percent, clearly helping the locals
(even Huadong's premium wines sell for only 25 yuan or $3 in
China).
</P>
<P>
   But Huadong isn't satisfied with being the big fish in a small
pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the best wine in Asia,'' Lin says. Mellowing a
little after several glasses and some wonderful Shandongese
cooking, watching bees skim wildflowers beneath the surreal Laoshan
peaks, it's hard not to cheer them on. &QL;

   QINGDAO, China _ A hot, sun-drenched summer day. Vines in neat,
disciplined rows climb the hillside behind you, the grapes ready to
be harvested, crushed and fermented in great barrels inside the
sprawling, whitewashed buildings below. Meanwhile, you admire the
wine, clear gold and deep purple, over a simple, delicious local
meal.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a scene anywhere in France, California's Napa
Valley or South Australia. Except that this is the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Years of experiments have led to breakthroughs on the Shandong
Peninsula, whose climate is uniquely suitable in Asia for
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   During China's Tang Dynasty, grape wine was imported from
Central Asia, where small amounts of port-like wine are still made
_ ``rooster's heart'' and ``cow's udder'' being two indigenous
varietals.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's climate, however, is generally inhospitable to
viniculture. Wine grapes need long days to ripen and dryness to
concentrate their juice; they are also very sensitive to cold.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's pervasive humidity and low latitudes present almost
insurmountable challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Shandong. The province stretches to the south of Beijing,
then juts out toward Korea, dividing the Gulf of Bohai from the
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean moderates the Siberian winters, while the northerly
latitude (similar to San Francisco's) and low summer humidity _ a
steady 60 percent _ allows temperate fruits like apples and
peaches, for which Shandong is famous, to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The first to recognize this potential was Zhang Bishi, a Qing
Dynasty official who founded the Chang Yu Winery near Yantai in
1892. Zhang brought vines from Europe and appointed Yantai's
Austrian consul as winemaker, but the winery today mostly makes a
localized kind of vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   The real trailblazer was an Englishman named Michael Parry, who
founded the Huadong Winery. Parry came to Hong Kong in 1973 as an
accountant, and drifted through a series of jobs before ending up
in the wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   As China started opening up after 1978, Parry became consumed
with the dream of producing first-class wine in China. In 1982 he
discovered the Shandong Peninsula, and with his partner Gabriel Tam
started convincing the local farmers to plant grapes where, in
marginal soil conditions, they had been growing sweet potatoes and
peanuts. In 1985, they planted 42,000 cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, a typhoon destroyed the vineyard, but
Parry persisted and replanted. By 1986, he was producing chardonnay
and riesling with the help of winemakers from California and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, having put up $1 million of his own
money, Parry went bankrupt and his stake (the joint-venture partner
was state-owned Tsingtao Winery) went to Hiram Walker, itself soon
bought by the British spirits company Allied-Domecq.
</P>
<P>
   Parry stayed on as adviser but his heart was broken. He died of
cancer two years later at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   His photograph hangs prominently at the winery's office _ a
giant of a man, with the glow of the bon vivant. His ashes are
buried on a hill overlooking the vineyard, and the farmers tend
reverently to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Huadong Winery sits among 14 hectares (35 acres) of a
steep, sun-facing basin in the Laoshan Mountains, 40 kilometers (25
miles) from Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape is sublime _ severe, forbidding crags soaring
above green summer fields. In the Chinese way of looking at things,
it's definitely Northern majesty, not Southern mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use this vineyard as a nursery,'' says George Zhao, the
winery's commercial manager. ``We sell cuttings all over the place
_ even Ningxia, Sichuan. People are planting vineyards all over
China.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also used to experiment with varieties like pinot noir and
gamay. Huadong's white wines, however, come from a larger vineyard,
400 hectares of chardonnay and riesling 120 kilometers to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soil is limy, sandy gravel,'' Zhao says. ``Useless for
most crops, but perfect for white wines.'' He adds that the
microclimate strongly resembles that of the region of France that
produces Beaujolais. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parry built the winery as a family residence, with living
quarters upstairs. They've since added a warehouse and cellar _ and
are building a guesthouse. ``Wine tourism,'' Zhao says, '' is the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about Huadong is how good their best
wines are. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The riesling is refreshing and aromatic, in the Alsatian style,
while the mildly oaked chardonnay is subtle and complex, almost
flinty like a chablis, more Burgundy than California.
</P>
<P>
   The red produced for the domestic market is forgettable, but the
winery is planning to produce a cabernet franc _ used in reds from
Touraine and Anjou in France _ from the 1999 vintage, and samples
from the barrel taste promising. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising because other Chinese wineries barely produce
anything recognizable as wine, much less good wine. Most of it,
anyhow, is drunk with Sprite or other mixers by status-conscious
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Chinese-owned Great Wall, Dragon Seal (a
joint-venture with Pernod-Ricard) and, the best of the lot,
Dynasty, a joint venture with Remy-Cointreau in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in 1980 as only the second joint venture in mainland
China, Dynasty produces small amounts of premium chardonnay that is
at least drinkable. Huadong says it's made with their surplus
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own our own vineyards just for that reason,'' says Lin
Keqiang, Huadong's general manager, ``to control the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, he says, is lack of government regulation.
``There are no AOC laws, no quality control. `Wine' only legally
needs to be 70 percent grape juice!''
</P>
<P>
   Li Peng's 1995 decree replacing baijiu, Chinese grain spirit,
with wine at banquets just led to officials drinking shots of wine
``down the hatch,'' like baijiu. Other obstacles include lack of
refrigerated storage.
</P>
<P>
   However erratic their support, Beijing does back the fledgling
wine industry, which after all produces a high-value product from
impoverished soils, not to mention freeing up scarce grain from
baijiu production and promoting healthier drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Duty on imported wine is 70 percent, clearly helping the locals
(even Huadong's premium wines sell for only 25 yuan or $3 in
China).
</P>
<P>
   But Huadong isn't satisfied with being the big fish in a small
pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the best wine in Asia,'' Lin says. Mellowing a
little after several glasses and some wonderful Shandongese
cooking, watching bees skim wildflowers beneath the surreal Laoshan
peaks, it's hard not to cheer them on. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decade's time there will be no more than six big car makers
left in the world, if the predictions of the auto industry pundits
prove correct.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic surgery being carried out at Nissan by its new
French masters is designed to ensure they are one of them.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecasters are correct _ and they include some eminent
industry figures such as Sir Alex Trotman, the former chairman of
Ford _ then early in the next millennium the car market will be
carved up between two American, two European and two Asian
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The process of consolidation is gathering speed. Most of the
minnows of the automotive world have already been absorbed into
larger, more financially robust, companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo are now part of Ford while
General Motors owns Saab, and Volkswagen of Germany owns Audi,
Seat, Skoda and Bentley. BMW, meanwhile, owns Rover, and in three
years' time will take control of the Rolls-Royce marque. Fiat owns
Lancia and Alfa Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only the smaller players that have been scooped
up. Eighteen months ago, Daimler-Benz of Germany and Chrysler of
the U.S. stunned the auto industry by unveiling a $40 billion
merger.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, creating the world's fourth biggest car maker behind
General Motors, Ford and Toyota, confounded conventional wisdom in
that it was a European car maker buying a competitor in another
continent. The Renault-Nissan deal is in the same mould.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is now waiting to see who will merge next. The
world car industry has the capacity to produce 40 percent more cars
than it sells each year while each new model can cost up to (pounds
sterling)600 million to develop. The cost savings that a successful
merger can bring are therefore enormous.
</P>
<P>
   But so are the political headaches because any combination of
two volume car makers in Europe or Asia would spell tens of
thousands of job losses.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are frequent suggestions that Renault and Citroen
will ultimately merge, the most likely pairing in Europe may turn
out to be a merger between Fiat and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the two French car makers, their contrasting model ranges
and geographic markets would probably mean limited job and plant
closures - perhaps none at all.
</P>
<P>
   The real prize comes in reducing the cost of future model
production by building a series of vehicles on what is known as a
single platform -- engine, gearbox, transmission, axle and
floorpan.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Nissan, Renault intends to reduce the number of
different platforms from 24 to 15. In the future, Renault cars
might by built on Nissan platforms and vice versa in Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a smaller scale the cost savings are significant. The
new baby Jaguar, which will emerge from Ford's Halewood plant in
two years, will be constructed around the platform of the Mondeo. &QL;

   In a decade's time there will be no more than six big car makers
left in the world, if the predictions of the auto industry pundits
prove correct.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic surgery being carried out at Nissan by its new
French masters is designed to ensure they are one of them.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecasters are correct _ and they include some eminent
industry figures such as Sir Alex Trotman, the former chairman of
Ford _ then early in the next millennium the car market will be
carved up between two American, two European and two Asian
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The process of consolidation is gathering speed. Most of the
minnows of the automotive world have already been absorbed into
larger, more financially robust, companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo are now part of Ford while
General Motors owns Saab, and Volkswagen of Germany owns Audi,
Seat, Skoda and Bentley. BMW, meanwhile, owns Rover, and in three
years' time will take control of the Rolls-Royce marque. Fiat owns
Lancia and Alfa Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only the smaller players that have been scooped
up. Eighteen months ago, Daimler-Benz of Germany and Chrysler of
the U.S. stunned the auto industry by unveiling a $40 billion
merger.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, creating the world's fourth biggest car maker behind
General Motors, Ford and Toyota, confounded conventional wisdom in
that it was a European car maker buying a competitor in another
continent. The Renault-Nissan deal is in the same mould.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is now waiting to see who will merge next. The
world car industry has the capacity to produce 40 percent more cars
than it sells each year while each new model can cost up to (pounds
sterling)600 million to develop. The cost savings that a successful
merger can bring are therefore enormous.
</P>
<P>
   But so are the political headaches because any combination of
two volume car makers in Europe or Asia would spell tens of
thousands of job losses.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are frequent suggestions that Renault and Citroen
will ultimately merge, the most likely pairing in Europe may turn
out to be a merger between Fiat and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the two French car makers, their contrasting model ranges
and geographic markets would probably mean limited job and plant
closures - perhaps none at all.
</P>
<P>
   The real prize comes in reducing the cost of future model
production by building a series of vehicles on what is known as a
single platform -- engine, gearbox, transmission, axle and
floorpan.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Nissan, Renault intends to reduce the number of
different platforms from 24 to 15. In the future, Renault cars
might by built on Nissan platforms and vice versa in Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a smaller scale the cost savings are significant. The
new baby Jaguar, which will emerge from Ford's Halewood plant in
two years, will be constructed around the platform of the Mondeo. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Wall Street opened for business Monday morning
it was not only investors, big and small, who waited in trepidation
to see which way the markets would move.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls who are already battling to succeed
President Bill Clinton were on tenterhooks, too, because a
sustained downturn in the longest peacetime boom the United States
has ever known could fundamentally change the political arithmetic
for next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been a prevailing consensus, fueled by the
innate optimism of the current generation of Americans, that the
boom could only continue.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, however, the mood started to change.
The previous five days had seen the steepest fall in share prices
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a veiled warning to the banks from the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, about market volatility
combined with an unexpectedly sharp increase in wholesale prices in
September to send the Dow Jones plunging more than 250 points in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   It even dipped briefly below the symbolic 10,000 points for the
first time since April, registering a fall of a full 12 percent
from the record 11,326 struck in August.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Wall Street Journal was awash with cautious
pessimism. ``Return to 10,000 _ Is this bear territory?'' read the
main headline of the investment section.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside, the second headline was even more worrying: ``Fed's
credibility as inflation foe may be weakening.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a very long time, doubts were being raised
about the judgment of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve and hero of the Clinton economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as six weeks ago, next year's presidential
candidates were pleading with Clinton to reappoint Greenspan early
for another term.
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted to avoid the chairmanship of the Fed becoming a
political issue on the eve of the election and worried that
attendant uncertainty could upset the markets. Now, they could be
overtaken by events.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who has most to lose from a serious downturn in
the economy would undoubtedly be Vice-President Al Gore. The
prosperity in which America has basked through Bill Clinton's
presidency is one of his strongest suits, and the one that Clinton
cites first when he campaigns on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling off a string of statistics: economic growth, income,
unemployment, he invites his audience to compare America now with
America when he came to office. ``Do you want more of the same?''
his implied message runs, ``Just vote for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the economy could outweigh much of the negative
baggage from the Clinton presidency that drags down Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Remove that advantage, though, and the Gore campaign looks much
weaker; the candidate will be left having to explain how he would
set about reviving an economic boom amid falling expectations, and
a far more pessimistic national mood.
</P>
<P>
   He would also be left _ as would all the other candidates _
explaining to voters how he would pay for his string of election
promises if it suddenly looked as though the much-heralded domestic
budget surplus was not going to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, economic bad news could provide a
windfall for Bill Bradley. Not only is he not associated with the
White House _ a distinct plus if Clinton bequeaths an ailing
economy as well as the integrity issue to his vice-president _ he
has also positioned himself politically to the left of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's unashamed recognition of the have-nots and his
promises of a more ``inclusive'' America could have more resonance
if the number of have-nots _ and those who perceived themselves as
such _ increases.
</P>
<P>
   Falling share prices would leave America's new generation of
private investors downcast (and out of pocket); it could also
depress wages, increase joblessness and endanger welfare reform
(which has succeeded so far largely because of the number of jobs
available).
</P>
<P>
   Job insecurity could also revive pressure for universal health
insurance, bringing Clinton's presidency full circle on health
policy. Bradley has already had something to say on all these
issues, and would need to change little in his campaign pitch to
appear a man for his times.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading Republican contender, George W. Bush, is also
neatly positioned to capitalize on Clinton-Gore economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks he has separated himself from Congressional
Republicans, accusing them of being unduly hardhearted towards the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   And only last week, he told New Yorkers: ``Too often my party
has focused on the national economy to the exclusion of all else _
speaking a sterile language of rates and numbers, of CBO/Central
Budget Office/this and GNP that...''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the economy thrives, such words convey the message to
voters that the prosperity of the Clinton presidency is not
everything. They could be easily adapted to leaner economic times,
however, offering reassurance to those who have lost out
economically and competing with Bradley's appeal to the newly
insecure.
</P>
<P>
   A further winner could be Pat Buchanan, the conservative
Republican who is on the verge of defecting to the Reform Party in
the hope of becoming that party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is the candidate of the right who is most forcefully
protectionist, a message that will fall on fertile ground if
unemployment rises.
</P>
<P>
   Any gain in votes for Buchanan, however, is likely to be Bush's
loss, harming his chances and making it more likely that a Democrat
returns to the White House. &QL;

   BEIJING _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin had no shortage of party

did back in 1996 when he visited Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jiang may have shown off his knowledge of
Western culture for the Queen with off-the-cuff recitals from
Shelly and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Oct. 1, he was stony-faced, inspecting troops in
a dour Mao suit for Beijing's 50th anniversary parade. But his
message for London and the Queen is that China means business, so
an immaculate Western business suit is the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was propelled from Shanghai party chief into the hot seat
of Communist Party boss back in 1989 by the political purges that
surrounded the army massacre of pro-democracy students in Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   At that time he was derided as ``the flower pot'' _ for being
decorative but ineffectual _ and many predicted he would not stay
atop the Chinese dragon for long.
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang's chameleon tendencies have served him well, and he is
looking to this European tour to put the finishing touches on his
ascendancy to the ranks of his two communist predecessors, Mao
Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind those Buddy Holly glasses, Jiang is a very intelligent
and shrewd politician,'' said William Ward, a U.S. academic who
lived in China in the 1980s and often played bridge with Jiang when
he was the mayor and party secretary of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a communist revolutionary martyr, Jiang was born in
the southeastern coastal province of Jiangsu in the year of the
tiger 1926, making him an exact contemporary of the Queen In 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a year in Russia at the labyrinthine Stalin Autoworks,
where he picked up a good knowledge of Russian _ he can still
recite the opening lines of ``Anna Karenina.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang hovered around the edges of the momentous political
events of his youth, surviving Maoist purges by keeping his head
down, and using his training as an electrical engineer to plod up
through China's heavy industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   His political career did not take off until 1986 when he became
Shanghai mayor. In the same year, he had his first encounter with
the Queen, hosting her in China's financial center during her state
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But his next brush with British royalty did not come until 1997
when he met Prince Charles during the handover of Hong Kong. By
that time, he was fully installed in Beijing as the undisputed heir
to Deng, who had died earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   His nation had recorded its fastest period of economic growth of
this century, and Western imports, from McDonalds to the Spice
Girls, abounded.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes that the third generation of Communist leadership in
China would lead to political reforms have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jiang's frequent use of the word ``democracy,''
political dissidents are regularly imprisoned for expressing their
views. In July, Jiang outlawed the Falun Gong meditation group as a
threat to state security.
</P>
<P>
   Cadres have spent much of the summer bogged down in the ``Three
Stresses'' political campaign, which is designed to shore up an
awkward amalgam of socialist and traditional Chinese values.
</P>
<P>
   Amongst Jiang's performance repertoire is the Western church
organ. Maybe during his visit to Cambridge he will be permitted to
repeat the Chinese ``Ode to the Yellow River,'' which he bashed out
on Dutch and Finnish organs in the past, making an equally quirky
mixture of East and West. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian navy is to sell off dolphins who were
specially trained to blow up enemy ships as part of the rundown of
its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins were taught to approach a vessel from below and rub
its back, to which a mine was attached, against the keel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine that those dolphins could even distinguish
between the sound of the propellor of a foreign submarine and a
Soviet one?'' Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the
General Head Quarters of the Soviet armed forces told the
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Training of some ten dolphins started 30 years ago on the Black
Sea at a base at Balaclava near Sebastopol in the Crimea. It is not
clear how many dolphins were taught to attack enemy vessels, but
some half dozen survive today.
</P>
<P>
   They were kept in a military laboratory, but further development
of the project stopped with the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dolphins are to be sold off, under a decree signed by
Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their sale is part of a general disposal of surplus military
equipment, such as old trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers
and bulldozers, which the impoverished Russian army no longer needs
or can afford to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have only pitiful remains of what we used to have in
the Black Sea dolphinarium,'' said Baranets. ``Only five or six
dolphins survived. They tried to keep couples _ male and female.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Kozir, a correspondent of the military newspaper,
Krasnaya Zvezda, says that the Soviet plan to train dolphins to
attack ships started as a response to information that the U.S. was
investigating the use of sea animals for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Soviet and American navies were impressed with the
ability of dolphins to perform complex tricks in circuses.
</P>
<P>
   Kozir says: ``They were trained to approach the ship from below
and to rub their backs against the bottom of the ship. The mine was
on the back of the dolphin.'' He added that some dolphins were
released into the Black Sea at the time of the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The naval department of the Russian Defense Ministry said
Tuesday that it could not confirm or deny accounts of the training
of dolphins to sink enemy ships, but it was opposed to their sale.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Dygalo, the navy spokesman, said: ``I just don't know
anything about dolphins, but even if we had such dolphins how can
we sell them?''
</P>
<P>
   His reason for opposing the sale of the dolphins is rooted in
the violence of Russian business rivalries and the possible use of
dolphins as an assassination weapon against businessmen who have
bought boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine selling dolphins, which have had special
training, to a businessman who has enemies?'' asks Dygalo. ``He can
attach a bomb to a dolphin and direct him to anyone or anything he
wants to get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact the dolphins, trained for so long to carry out their
lone kamikaze missions, may have a more prosaic fate.
</P>
<P>
   Baranets says that he suspects that at the end of the day the
dolphins may not be sold to murderous businessmen but presented to
water circuses. He says: ``There is one at Sochi (on the Black Sea
coast) where you drop your wedding ring into the water and the
dolphins easily find it.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another star, another traffic jam. They get used to
it in New York. The President is in town? Stay away from The
Waldorf. Ricky Martin is stopping in Times Square? Don't go near
the place.
</P>
<P>
   But how many New Yorkers would have thought to dodge Fifth
Avenue because of a box of bones?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a number, in fact, especially if they were Catholics. They
would not have been surprised by the circus that erupted with the
casket's arrival just after dusk at the steps of St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The weeping women, reaching out to touch. The devoted followers
gripping candles in their hands. It got so crazy, they had to close
Fifth Avenue for half an hour. That never happened to The Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest stop on the world tour not of a rock star
_ St. Patrick's, after all, is hardly Madison Square Garden _ but
of a saint, or rather the remains of a saint.
</P>
<P>
   This box was, more accurately, a reliquary of polished jacaranda
decorated with exquisite gold and silver filigree. And it contained
bones from the body of St. Therese of Lisieux, also known as the
``little flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything you will ever need to know about St. Therese is on
her website _ www.littleflower.org.
</P>
<P>
   You will see how she joined a Carmelite Convent at 16, how she
wrote a memoir, ``The Story of a Soul,'' and how, after a simple
life of devotion, she died from tuberculosis at 24 in 1897. The
book has become one of the most widely read works of Catholic
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   You will also learn about her gruelling global pilgrimage that
is already three years old. So far, St. Therese _ or at least half
her bones, the remaining half are in France _ has toured Russia,
most of western Europe, Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to hurtle across the United States and Canada,
making appearances at 114 churches and monasteries, before heading
to the Philippines in January.
</P>
<P>
   Therese of Lisieux was canonized back in 1925. It was for the
normal pre-canonization investigative process that her body was
disinterred, which has ensured the continuing availability of her
bones today.
</P>
<P>
   But her status in the Catholic firmament was boosted further in
1997, the centenary of her death, when Pope John Paul II proclaimed
her to be a Doctor of the Church. She is the youngest of 33 saints
who have the title, which denotes a special holiness. And she is
one of only three women Doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, she has pulling power. At every stop, the
crowds of faithful come to venerate her. The lucky ones get to
touch the Perspex dome that surrounds the reliquary or to press
their lips against it.
</P>
<P>
   Her draw is not hard to explain. There was the simplicity of her
life _ there were no great deeds or miracles to her name _ and she
is accessible to worshippers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not often that we get to see a saint, or at least the
relics of a saint,'' said Gerry Olsen as she stepped out from St.
Patrick's Monday. With her husband, Bill, she had come just to be
able to look at the reliquary in front of the altar. ``You feel
close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   There are the photographs of St. Therese that fellow nuns took
of her at the Lisieux Convent. The saint doing the laundry and the
saint lying in bed, stricken by the disease that killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can really feel her presence,'' said Roz Romero, a Wall
Street broker who had come to the cathedral. ``She tells us that
anybody is capable of being a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's was well prepared for the surge of visitors that
was sure to come for the 40 hours that the reliquary was to remain
within its walls.
</P>
<P>
   There is an exhibition of her pictures down one transept, with
testimonials from famous devotees of St. Therese. Among them was
Edith Piaf who was blind until three, when she was taken to visit
Lisieux. For the rest of her life she thanked St. Therese for her
sight.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the demand, services and liturgies were planned
right through until 5 a.m. when St. Therese was due to leave for
another parish in Brooklyn. At least at that hour, her departure
should cause only the minimum of traffic gridlock. &QL;

   MACAU _ The checkered history of this indolent 446-year-old
Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are weeping as China
prepares to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Macau is where the Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn tried to
recoup his gambling losses by introducing cock-fighting in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   It is where spies and mercenaries flocked to swap stories over
vinho verde during World War II when the rest of the world honored
Portugal's neutrality and transformed Macau into the Casablanca of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred years ago Macau was far richer. Portuguese traders
dined on plates of gold, enjoying the fruits a century-long world
monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and silver with Japan
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was always a seamy side to Macau's wealth. The
Portuguese imported slaves from Africa to heave bales onto sailing
schooners. Some of the slaves would escape on boats and turn into
the legendary pirates of the South China Sea. Macau also had its
share of the opium trade.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Macau's shallow seaport evaporated when Britain
seized the deep-water port of Hong Kong in 1841 and it became the
linchpin of the region's commerce. About 20 years later, Portuguese
Gov. Isidoro Francisco Guimaraes saved Macau from ruin by granting
the first gambling licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all this, Macau has grown into one of the oldest, most
lucrative gambling resorts in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With casinos have come wide-open prostitution and police
corruption, along with recurrent battles between Chinese Triad
criminal syndicates in which 35 people have died just this year.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, China and Portugal had no trouble agreeing
that the Portuguese should end their occupation, setting a deadline
just before the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have stuck to this pact with little friction. And so
on the evening of December 19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau
and China are due to dine here in a temporary steel-and-glass
banquet hall that will look like a giant Chinese lantern
overlooking the Pearl River estuary.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight they will toast the end of nearly 450 years
of Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral
strikes 12:00, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and oldest
Western enclave in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   At one instant after midnight on December 20, the flag of the
People's Republic of China will rise over Macau. An assemblage of
Chinese communist dignitaries, including President Jiang Zemin,
will smile with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks will light the sky and this 8-square-mile territory
will become part of China under a guarantee of 50 years of
self-rule under Chinese sovereignty, in a form of self-government
similar to Hong Kong's.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly to be sworn in as the new Macau governor is one of
Macau's richest businessmen, 44-year-old Canadian-educated banker
Edmund Ho Hau-wah. Already a member of the Beijing communist
establishment, Ho is a Macau delegate on China's powerful standing
committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prominent and powerful participants in the
evening will be billionaire gambling proprietor Stanley Ho, 77,
whose corporation operates all of Macau's 10 gambling casinos under
a monopoly franchise he was granted by Portuguese authorities when
he submitted the highest bid 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new governor and the gambling proprietor are not
blood relatives, they are friends and fellow shareholders in
Macau's television network. The casino proprietor was one of the
most influential backers of the governor's selection.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the most important decision confronting Gov. Ho is
whether to renew Stanley Ho's gambling monopoly when the current
Macau casino license expires in 2001. Ho's company has reportedly
been paying the Macau treasury 31.8 percent of the calculated net
profits of the casinos, or about $750 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is waiting to see whether the new governor splits up
the franchise, issuing 10 new licenses for each of the 10 casinos,
or lets Stanley Ho keep his Macau gambling monopoly. Not content to
rely on chance, Stanley Ho has been busily developing a new
gambling venture in the
</P>
<P>
   Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in the first few weeks, this will be a far less
contentious, emotion-packed handover than when the British somewhat
reluctantly pulled out of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chinese takeover approaches, almost no public dissent has
arisen among the 96 percent of 440,000 Macau residents who speak
Chinese as a first language. Even among Macau's 1.8 percent of
native Portuguese-speakers, acquiescence has been widespread.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that Portugal has been eager for two decades
to liquidate this last remnant of its empire, so long as it can do
so with a modicum of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Portugal never encouraged strong Hong Kong-style
democratic institutions either in Macau or any of its colonies. So
Macau has no real focal point for anti-Beijing protests of the kind
that broke out in Hong Kong before the British colony's handover.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Macau are not so concerned about democratic
protections, or even about human rights protections, as they are in
Hong Kong,'' said Macau legislative assembly delegate Ng Kuok
Cheong, one of Macau's few vocal democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese who settled in this sunwashed enclave were largely
farmers looking for a better living, he said, while Hong Kong
tended to draw educated Chinese looking for intellectual freedom or
hard-charging business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the flag, the handover probably won't change much for
the 7 million tourists who annually contribute 40 percent of
Macau's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this will be a big historic moment,'' says Maria Helena
de Senna Fernandes, deputy head of the Macau Tourist Office. ``But
for tourism, it is business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's puritanical streak, Chinese leaders have made
clear that they are not going to interfere with the prevailing
atmosphere of hedonism-for-profit.
</P>
<P>
   Next year in Macau, visitors can still eat African chicken and
drink soft Douro wine at languid bars until they imagine they're in
Portuguese Mozambique 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be nubile hookers in four-inch platform shoes
who approach men in the elevators of the five-star Hotel Lisboa,
offering themselves for 500 patacas (US$66).
</P>
<P>
   There will still be casinos as busy as stock exchanges where it
isn't hard to lose US$250,000 in baccarat in half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be the murderous loan sharks called ``chip
boys'' who lurk near the cashier's window, offering to let losers
keep on gambling by taking out a high-interest loan from one of the
Triad criminal mobs.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this will still be Macau.

   MACAU _ Here is a capsule history of Macau, the last and oldest
Western enclave on the Asian continent that is about to return to
Chinese rule:
</P>
<P>
   1535 _ Imperial bureaucrats of China's Ming Dynasty allow
Portuguese vessels to dock and conduct trade in Macau port.
</P>
<P>
   1543-1639 _ Portugal enjoys a de facto monopoly on trade between
China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   1553 _ Portuguese sailors set up their first permanent
settlement on Macau, telling the Chinese they needed a place to dry
goods damaged by water.
</P>
<P>
   1557 _ Portuguese establish a walled village begin paying ground
rents for the right to live on the Macau peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   1622 _ Dutch vessels attack Macau in an effort to break
Portugal's century-long monopoly of trade with China and Japan. The
attack is repelled, but Dutch and British renew efforts to cut into
Portugal's trade.
</P>
<P>
   1700s _ Macau declines economically as China crimps trade and
rejects Portuguese envoys.
</P>
<P>
   1845 _ Portugal expels Chinese customs officials and declares
the Macau peninsula a free port, then expands its territory by
seizing nearby Taipa and Coloane islands a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   About 1860 - The Portuguese governor issues the first gambling
licences in Macau.
</P>
<P>
   1887 _ China's weak Qing imperial dynasty signs a ``Treaty of
Commerce and Friendship'' recognizing Portuguese sovereignty over
Macau and allowing it ``perpetual occupation'' of the territory.
Today's Chinese historians say the treaty was never ratified by
China.
</P>
<P>
   1939-1945 _ Macau escapes ravages of World War II and flourishes
as a free port because the belligerents recognize Portugal's
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   1955 _ Portugal passes an ``organic law'' declaring Macau one of
its overseas colonies.
</P>
<P>
   1966 _ Portuguese installations are attacked by Red Guards
during China's Cultural Revolution, and a few are killed by
Portuguese troops.
</P>
<P>
   1974 _ After a coup in Portugal, the new anti-colonial
government declares it no longer has sovereignty over Macau but
continues administering it as ``a Chinese territory under
Portuguese administration.''
</P>
<P>
   1987 _ Portugal and China declare that China will ``resume'' the
administration of Macau on December 20, 1999, and that Macau's laws
and way of life would continue for at least 50 years.

   MARCOVIA, Honduras _ Maritza Espinar spent four terrifying days
clinging to the high branches of a tree last year after Hurricane
Mitch flattened her home in a village near here.
</P>
<P>
   When new floods in September sent a tributary of the Choluteca
River once again rising toward the place she lived, she didn't
waste any time evacuating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get scared now when I see even a little bit of high water,''
said the soft-spoken mother of seven, who was plucked by a
helicopter from her tree-top perch after Mitch. ``It's something
you can never erase from your mind. I never thought I would make it
out alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stories are not uncommon around this poor, mountainous
nation of 5 million. Mitch was the worst disaster in more than a
century, killing some 9,000 people and leveling or damaging more
than 50,000 homes. Floodwaters severed roads, destroyed bridges and
wiped out crops _ bananas, sugar, cantaloupes and pond-raised
shrimp _ that provide employment for much of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
   The people of this Central American region had hoped that by
now, a year after Mitch blew ashore on Oct. 25, the storm would be
nothing more than a frightful memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent floods are evidence that Mitch is still having an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, raging waters have knocked down bridges,
washed out roads, toppled houses and killed more than 20 people in
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing fact is that the new floods have come not from a
hurricane, but from the normal rains that fall every year during
the wet season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still so much debris and sediment in the riverbeds
from Mitch that it doesn't take as much water as before to come
over the banks,'' said Phil Gelman, coordinator of emergency
services for Atlanta-based CARE, one of many international aid
groups here. ``The new floods have been very damaging
psychologically. People had just begun putting some distance
between themselves and Mitch, and now some of them are finding
themselves flooded out for the second time in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, aid groups are pushing a program to help identify
and protect watersheds _ an idea backed by the Honduran government.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch's floods were exacerbated because much of the country has
been deforested by timber companies and people cutting wood for
fuel. Protecting upland areas will prevent erosion and lessen the
impact of future floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch has made us aware of these things,'' said Moises
Starkman, head of the Honduran government's recovery efforts.
``Still, none of this can be done overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new floods are fresh proof that a full recovery from
Mitch will take years. While many areas _ including the Caribbean
resorts that cater to foreign tourists _ are back to normal,
Mitch's damage was so severe that officials had to draw up a new
map of Honduras, showing the new river channels left by the floods.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 people are still without permanent housing,
with 13,000 living in temporary shelters set up by the government
and relief organizations, according to Honduran officials. The rest
are crowded in with friends or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   While main roads have been passable for months, there are dozens
of temporary bridges and countless hastily-repaired wash-outs on
dangerous, winding mountain highways that remain vulnerable to new
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments have pledged $2.7 billion in aid to
Honduras, with much of that intended for infrastructure like roads
and bridges. In most cases the work hasn't yet begun because the
process of obtaining funds and drawing up plans is only now being
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The permanent repairs on the bridges and roads will begin
soon,'' Starkman said. ``The good news is that we have been moving
forward on housing and sanitation. There were predictions that
after Mitch we would have widespread famine and outbreaks of
disease, and we managed to avoid that. What we have now is not
paradise, but it's much better than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of international aid groups _ including CARE, Ox-Fam and
the Red Cross _ have pitched in, building hundreds of new homes.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the poor are receiving better-built houses than
they've ever known _ usually small, cement-block structures of a
few hundred square feet with tin roofs and no electricity or
in-door plumbing. But for people who lived in dirt-floor adobe
huts, the improvement is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house was taken by the river, along with everything we
owned,'' said Nettie Roosevelt, 17, who recently moved to a new
house in a community being funded by CARE. ``This new house is very
nice. Our old one was rented and it leaked every time it rained.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Marcovia, several international relief agencies are
building an entire new town, relocating people from six rural
villages that were flooded. The municipal government helped obtain
land on high ground, and local sugar growers provided machinery to
clear roads and truck in materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we told the people they would have to build the houses
themselves, many of them sat down and cried,'' said Carolina
Gamero, an architect who, working with CARE, designed the new town
and has overseen its construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had never done construction before, but they learned,''
Gamero said. ``At first many people were reluctant to say they
wanted to move here. But now that the houses are up, I get new
people every day saying they want to move here.''
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to wait until the town's sewer and water systems were
complete before moving the residents in, but the recent floods
created a new emergency. Temporary latrines have been set up, and
water is being trucked in.
</P>
<P>
   With the construction site suddenly transformed into a town, aid
workers are facing new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building the houses was the easy part,'' Gamero said. ``What
we have to do now is get the residents to make it a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents are being asked to set up committees to plan how they
will deal with sanitation, rubbish disposal, employment and other
issues. Many lived in rural isolation previously, and now must
adjust to being in close quarters with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one man say he had never used a latrine before,'' Gamero
said, ``and ask why should he start using one now.''

   MARCOVIA, Honduras _ The walls are unadorned cement blocks, the
floor is poured concrete, the roof made from plain sheets of metal.
The kitchen is a lean-to out back with a small, smoky cooking fire.
</P>
<P>
   But Rita Galvez proudly sits inside the tiny structure, holding
her breath. To her, this diminutive house _ the size of a typical
two-car American garage _ may as well be a millionaire's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I would have a house like this,'' she says,
gazing with wide eyes at her 400-square-foot, four-room bungalow.
``Sometimes I talk with friends from my old village and I still
can't believe I am living here.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America, life
is getting better for thousands of the killer storm's victims.
Although new flooding this fall has brought more misery to many of
those left homeless by Mitch, a massive rebuilding program
spearheaded by aid groups from around the world has made
significant progress.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic example is here in Marcovia, a low-lying village in
south Honduras, a few miles from the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific
coast. Mitch's torrential rains turned the normally placid
Choluteca River into a raging force that inundated miles of the
flat coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
   Small villages were swept away or covered with mud to the
rooftops, and dozens of people drowned. Prized farm animals were
lost, along with the sugar cane, cantaloupe and pond-raised shrimp
that provided most of the work in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CARE, Ox-Fam, the Red Cross and other
international aid agencies joined forces to build a whole new town
on high ground a few miles outside flood-prone Marcovia. The new
village is called ``Renacer Marcovia,'' or ``Reborn Marcovia.''
</P>
<P>
   It spreads across 70 acres of pasture, row upon row of small,
square houses. The streets are still muddy in places, and children
bath in a stream that winds through the property. Sewer and water
lines have yet to be installed, but temporary latrines and
trucked-in water are an improvement over what many of the poor
residents lived with previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old house had a dirt floor,'' said Galvez, who now sweeps
her new home's cement floor several times a day, stepping carefully
over a threshold poured in the doorway that is inscribed with the
family's name. ``It only had two rooms and no windows. We had nine
people living there.''
</P>
<P>
   The new town was designed by Carolina Gamero, a Honduran
architect. In an exhausting year of work, she has seen the town
rise before her eyes, an accomplishment that many residents never
believed would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them didn't want to leave the places where they lived
before,'' she said. ``At first, they didn't like this place because
it was hot and had few trees. But as the houses have come up, they
are starting to see what we envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents were required to build the houses themselves, with
aid workers teaching them how to lay block, square up walls and mix
cement. Some 600 homes are now finished, with another 600 to go.
The town will eventually house about 8,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gamero, 35, now walks around town, overseeing construction
crews, pushing for faster work, resolving small conflicts. She is
constantly praised and hugged, often by proud new homeowners with
tears in their eyes. She is also begged by doubters who didn't
commit to work on the new town but now want in.
</P>
<P>
   ``For months we came here and it was some new problem every
day,'' she said. ``It was 120 degrees at times and people didn't
want to work. They didn't believe we could do it. Now we walk
around and see children playing and it's becoming a real town.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: BERLIN UNDERGOES RADICAL CHANGE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ It has been noted that a third of the world's
construction cranes are now at work in Shanghai. If that's so,
Berlin must be running a close second as the Germans strive to
restore some stately Prussian grandeur to their reclaimed capital,
along with a fresh topping of high-tech gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, the German parliament voted, 337 to 320, to
move from Bonn, its snug postwar seat by the Rhine, back into the
historic Reichstag in the heart of town. The British architect,
Norman Foster, left in place some of the Red Army's graffiti from
1945 while raising an airy ceiling that invokes the next century.
</P>
<P>
   As seen from the newly opened dome, bright yellow cranes rise
high above the scarred earth in virtually all directions _ but
mainly to the east, where the Wall came tumbling down on the
bankrupt Communist regime a decade ago. Huge water-bearing steel
pipes, painted in pastel shades, line the building sites to bar
them from being flooded by Berlin's porous soil.
</P>
<P>
   As in the legendary era of Marlene Dietrich after World War I,
Berlin has emerged once more as a lively metropolis. The government
has already spent some $17 billion on official construction
projects. Outlays for private developments are eight times as much.
Fully a tenth of the city's 1.1 million workers are engaged in the
rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike London or Paris, Berlin seems to have been wrenched from
the sandy soil by some random force. There are no mighty rivers or
harbors here, nor any natural wealth. But even if Berlin's 3.5
million residents ``play in the second league,'' as one official
here put it, Germany, the top power in Europe, has made a clear
commitment to Berlin of the kind never extended to Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   That's because before World War II, Berlin served not only as
the political seat of government, as it does once more today, but
also as the core of the nation's economic, industrial, and military
life. Amid the Cold War, as a divided Germany rose from the ruins
imposed on the Nazis, the Western part opted for a decentralized,
federated structure.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the powerful Bundesbank, or central bank, was placed not
in Bonn but in Frankfurt. Similarly, the Federal Constitutional
Court, the supreme judicial arbiter, met in Karlsruhe, while the
Federal Crime Agency, the German counterpart of the FBI, sat in
Wiesbaden.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Hamburg emerged as the editorial headquarters for many
national news outlets, while vital national cultural institutions
arose in such cities as Munich, the Bavarian capital, and
Dusseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   Not all goes well, however, as consolidation proceeds at a rapid
pace. The U.S. State Department remains in a stew over Berlin's
refusal to shift two streets near the Brandenburg Gate by nearly
100 feet. Without such a move, says American ambassador John
Kornblum, security concerns won't make it possible to build a new
embassy in the now open field where it last stood in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Kornblum: ``The overall German view of things is, 'We have
a way of life here. We would like to find a way to deal with the
high-tech revolution and still preserve that way of life.' ``

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Feeling the loss of Jean Shepherd
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Shepherd helped to rear me during a couple of pivotal years
in my early adolescence, but don't blame him for the outcome. He
didn't know he was implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd was, I guess you would have to say, a radio
personality, but without the connotations of vacuity, political
demagoguery or social loutishness that now so often adhere to the
term. He was instead creative and engagingly cultured in a causal
Midwestern way, and he carried a quiet, refracted wit familiarly,
like a valise that had been around.
</P>
<P>
   I listened to Shepherd on WSAI in Cincinnati in _ oh, I'm not
sure: around 1950. Within a few years he was in the big time in New
York City, where the big time is.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doing his radio shows, Shepherd wrote books with
whimsical titles like ``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and
Other Disasters.'' He wrote movies, too. One, ``A Christmas
Story,'' seemed to catch up my own Ohio boyhood uncannily, right
down to the forlorn yearning I had shared with its 9-year-old
Ralphie Parker for a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall McLuhan once characterized Shepherd as a radio
novelist. Maybe so. He was a storyteller certainly but at his best
he was more. A fabulist, say.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, Shepherd disc-jockeyed an afternoon program of
offbeat pop, jazz and classical recordings that would never get
anywhere near the Hit Parade. He led me to the Bunny Berrigan
trumpet solo that blows up like a sudden heat storm midway through
the vocal goo of Tommy Dorsey's ``Marie.'' To hear that flash of
brass lightning at just exactly the moment you are ready for it is
. . . well, I don't want to make too much of this, but I still
listen to the solo every few months. It is my true north.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his late-night show, with room for his improvised
musings, that Shepherd came most tellingly into his own. I was
supposed to be asleep but I would turn my bedside table radio low
and pull the blanket up over it, and over me, to dampen the sound
and I would listen into the small hours.
</P>
<P>
   There were wistful monologues, and meditations on music. And
Shepherd would imagine surreal scenes in careful detail _ Toscanini
conducting a symphony orchestra in a flat Kansas cornfield beside a
lone railroad track. As a Kurt Weill song sensibly counsels, ``O,
don't ask why.''
</P>
<P>
   He broadcast for a while, improbably, from a restaurant called
Shuller's Wigwam. Every night a fellow would come in, or so
Shepherd said, dressed in a three-button charcoal suit and carrying
a black umbrella. He would order onion soup. Shepherd would imagine
the diner's thoughts as he methodically spooned his way through the
soup. The man in the three-button charcoal suit never spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd had a taste for words. He savored them like
butterballs. There was a sweetness to his rambles around the human
condition, saved from surfeit by a ready sense of irony and a
distancing bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd died a few days ago, long since replaced as a tutor to
today's adolescents by MTV. Their loss.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ``If It's Noon, We're In ... Where?''
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 24, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ In the farcical 1969 film ``If It's
Tuesday, It Must Be Belgium,'' the principals _ tourists _ were
moving around Europe at a breakneck pace: something like Holland on
Sunday, France on Monday, and, on Tuesday, it must be Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The premise wasn't quite far from wrong. The stereotypical
American tourist tends to rush through Europe, much as he would a
Taco Bell lunch. Maybe dashing from Frankfurt to Vienna and then on
to Budapest in just three days is a bit much, but sometimes there
is little reason to stay any longer.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded of a classic Art Buchwald column from his Paris
days. In it, he wrote that only three things are worth seeing in
the Louvre: Venus de Milo, the Winged Victory, and the Mona Lisa.
``Everything else is junk,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he continued, there grew a competition to see how
fast one could whiz through the Louvre to gaze upon those three
objects. Thus was born ``The Six-Minute Louvre,'' a feat Buchwald
says was accomplished by an American student sometime around 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, a new entrance has been built to the Louvre
(a considerable hurdle) and new sections opened to further impede
the path. As a result, any improvement on the ``Six-Minute Louvre''
has become inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   That was on my mind the other day when my wife and I zipped
through portions of this little country. Armed with a SwissRail
ticket that allows unlimited transportation on trains, boats, buses
and trams, it wasn't so much a case of ``If It's Tuesday, It Must
Be Belgium''; it was more like ``If It's 1 p.m., It Must Be
Interlaken.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending the night in Thun, we planned to take a boat ride
across Lake Thun to Interlaken. But when I arrived at the dock
shortly after 10 a.m., the boat already had left and another wasn't
due until two hours later. Too long to wait. So we walked across
the street and hopped a train _ not to Interlaken but to Bern,
about 25 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Bern is not an exciting time but we managed to find
open an art museum featuring Swiss artist Paul Klee. It was not an
extensive collection so the Kunstmuseum, three blocks from the
train station, was behind us in less than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Bern train station, and it approaching the
lunch hour, we were off again _ this time to Interlaken for still
another quick zip. (This can easily be done in Interlaken, as it
offers the careening tourist little more than souvenir shops.)
Lunch was a 30-minute exercise and we were back on the train to
Thun where we rushed to a nearby museum that was showing the work
of Japanese modern artists _ a huge cardboard shed on blocks; a
bunch of candles on the floor _ before spending time watching swans
on the Aare River in front of our hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The day was beginning to be a blur to us, much as it must have
been when that young man raced past Winged Victory in search of the
Mona Lisa. But what straightened our senses was when we inquired
about the prix fixe dinner being offered by our hotel. The maitre
d' informed us we had a choice of veal kidneys, venison or
``pferdefleish,'' which translates to horse meat!
</P>
<P>
   As so we were afoot again. If it's 8 p.m., it must be dinner
time but, hopefully, not at any place serving up horse meat. This
was not a restriction easily met. Ultimately, we found a place
that, while offering up a dish called ``Mustang-Teller'' _
translates on the menu as ``air-dried horse meat'' _ there were
significant other choices. And, besides, we just wanted to sit
down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a somewhat exhausting day and I'm certain others have
whizzed through myriad Swiss cities in equal or less time, but we
felt we had accomplished something.
</P>
<P>
   What that is, I do not know.

 &HT;    Mysteries by Grimes, Hillerman feature quirky, fun plots
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Please don't tell my lovely wife, but I fear I've fallen in love
with Martha Grimes, author of the Richard Jury mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   I've never met Ms. Grimes, but I've read 10 of her novels
featuring Scotland Yard Superintendent Jury and his eccentric crew
of friends. Funny thing is _ one of many funny thins _ Ms. Grimes'
stories are set mostly in jolly ol' England and named for English
pubs, but Ms. Grimes herself is American and lives in Washington,
D.C, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that makes sense, the improbability of it, once you've
read a couple of her books. She tells her stories with the
quizzicalness of an outsider who is, somehow, yet an insider.
</P>
<P>
   In the one I just finished reading _ ``Stargazey,'' named, as
usual, for an English pub _ Jury and his pal, and sometimes
unofficial assistant on murder cases, Melrose Plant, investigate
the murder of a woman who at first seems to be the woman Jury saw
on a double-decker London bus. It turns out to be someone else, but
she is found wearing a sable coat like the woman Jury saw was
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   I realize the above effort to summarize the outset of this
Grimes mystery is no doubt confusing, but what can I say? That's
the way it begins. It isn't the confusing situations, or unusual
situations, that have caused me to fall for Ms. Grimes. That has
grown from reading her books and involving myself in her characters
and unique humor.
</P>
<P>
   I must point out that, although her stories are, indeed,
``murder mysteries,'' they are never gory or filled with details
that cause the reader to grimace from distaste. As in the stories
of, say, Agatha Christie and that ilk, the fun is in trying to
solve the mysteries rather than ride a roller coaster emotionally.
But these are very up-to-date, hip stories and atmospheres, both in
time and attitude, and much funnier than Ms. Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it would be difficult to explain the reasons I have
fallen for Ms. Grimes and her stories, and it is. It defies my
ability to express myself. You'll just have to try one or two
yourself and see if you don't find that her stories make you
chuckle from cover to cover as you wrestle with the puzzles she
presents.
</P>
<P>
   Another series author whose books always make me grab them from
the library and paperback shelves is Tony Hillerman, the writer who
once taught journalism at the University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman's books almost always feature the adventures of Navajo
Tribal policeman Jim Chee and his now retired boss Joe Leaphorn. In
the earlier stories, Leaphorn has not yet retired and the tension
between these two extremely intelligent and intuitive rural cops is
a large part of each story's suspense. Chee, the younger, is as
stubborn as his boss and they clash silently from start to finish.
A large part of the conflict is complicated by the high respect
each stubborn man has for the other.
</P>
<P>
   Hillerman's widespread popularity has put his books in most
bookstores as a paperback, and at all libraries in hardback. I
sometimes run across one I had somehow skipped and I am always glad
to discover it because it gives me another good one to get into.
Hillerman has written a couple of novels that do not involve his
Navajo heroes. One I recommend is ``A Fly on the Wall,'' which is
about newspaper reporters and their trials and tribulations in
covering crime and politics. Although it was written some time ago,
the current U.S. political condition makes it timely, except the
fact that nowadays reporters rarely use typewriters, which may seem
ancient to some, but bring back pleasant memories to others.

 &HT;    Another tough loss
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ It's October, and my heart has been broken
once again. The Red Sox lost to the Yankees in the league
Championship Series. Once again, they're home for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Red Sox fan teaches one the true meaning of that
hackneyed phrase, ``the agony of defeat.'' Sure, there are other
teams with long losing legacies: the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland
Indians come to mind, and both the Astros and the Rangers are vying
to become the playoff pansies of the new millennium. I will match
my pain against fans of those teams anytime, because the Sox have
actually managed to get to the World Series three times in my life:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1967, as I watched in the Allenstown, N.H., elementary
school cafeteria along with the entire school, the ``Impossible
Dream'' team, led by Carl Yastrzemski and Rico Petrocelli along
with Cy Young award-winning pitcher Jim Lonborg, made it to the
October Classic _ only to lose in seven games to the Cardinals and
fastballer Bob Gibson. It was the first time the team had made it
to the series since 1946, an event deemed momentous enough to
warrant school-wide viewing of the game. Of course, it was an
awfully small school. My seventh grade had 12 people in it.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1975, as I watched on a black-and-white TV in our tiny
duplex on Mitchell Street in Nacogdoches, Carlton Fisk frantically
waved his long ball fair to give the Red Sox the win in
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 of their Series against the Cincinatti Reds. The Reds won
Game 7, and I haven't liked Pete Rose or Johnny Bench since.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1986, I watched from my weekly newspaper office in San
Augustine, deep in the woods of East Texas, as Bill Buckner let a
ground ball roll through his legs that my grandmother could have
fielded cleanly, and the Mets won Game 6 and then Game 7 to take
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's 1999. Their loss to those damn Yankees means the
century likely will end without them having another World
Championship. They have only more chance, next fall in 2000. The
Red Sox have not won a World Series since Babe Ruth was pitching
for them and Woodrow Wilson was president _ 1918 to be exact.
They're 0-for-5 in the Series in the past 80 years. Four
generations of my French-Canadian family have waited futilely for
the Red Sox to win the World Series. We're still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox did better than I thought they would, eternal pessimist
that I am. Ace reliever Tom Gordon, who achieved a certain
immortality when Stephen King earlier this year wrote a book called
``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' went down for the season with a
bum arm. Batting title champ Nomar Garciaparra went on the disabled
list, and Brett Saberhagen, a previous Cy Young winner, is a shadow
of his fomer self.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's Pedro Martinez, with his preternaturally long
fingers, who went 23-4. Then the Sox swept the Yankees in New York
in August during the regular season. Hope floats.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, the Sox's first playoff opponent, quickly
dashed those hopes by winning the first two games of the
best-of-five series, and I went into my ``Wait 'til next year''
mode. A man could have made a pile in Las Vegas taking the Sox to
win the next three by scoring 44 runs against what is arguably the
most-solid team in the majors, to advance to the next level and
play the Yankees. Of course, they didn't last long _ out in five
games _ bumbling balls, leaving a few dozen stranded, and being
victimized by some of the worst calls made by umpires I've ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   I take back what I've said about the Aggies. Truth be known, I
root for the Aggies if they get to a bowl game and aren't playing
Texas. I'm not sure I would root for the Yankees if they were
playing the Iraqi Olympic team. The Yankees stole Babe Ruth,
beginning an eight-decade tradition of the Red Sox trading their
best players to their most-hated rivals. More recently, the Yankees
traded for Wade Boggs, a lock for the Hall of Fame, and now Roger
Clemens, a fellow UT grad who spent two seasons in Toronto before
arriving in the Big Apple. I will be rooting for Atlanta in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are a hard team to keep the faith in, sort of like
trying to love a philandering husband who can't keep a job, but I
have managed to do so, though it will be sorely tested when Fenway
Park is torn down, sometime in the near future. There are few
better places to be on a cool summer night than Fenway. If the
baseball gods are listening, maybe they'll grant us gray-headed
fans one last World Series in the shadow of the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bet on it.

 &HT;    Recalling life in the slow lane
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Those who grew up in a small town and couldn't
wait to get out and make it big in the big city often find after a
few years a wave of nostalgia has washed away most of the bad
memories of life in the slow lane.
</P>
<P>
   This e-mail from is from a friend,who couldn't wait for the
bright lights and big city. She now looks on her days growing up in
a little town as a badge of honor. Here's her list of ways to know
if you might be from a small town:
</P>
<P>
   You can name everyone you graduated with.
</P>
<P>
   You get a whiff of manure and think of home.
</P>
<P>
   You know what 4-H is.
</P>
<P>
   You ever went to ``headlight parties.''
</P>
<P>
   You used to drag ``main.''
</P>
<P>
   You schedule parties around the schedule of different police
officers, since you know which ones will bust you and which ones
won't.
</P>
<P>
   You ever went cow-tipping.
</P>
<P>
   You have ever partied with a guy who is 25, has no job, but is
the `buyer' for all of the best parties.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone in your school also has a cousin in your school.
</P>
<P>
   School gets canceled for state sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The town's social events are their childrens'.
</P>
<P>
   You could never buy cigarettes because all the store clerks knew
how old you were (and if you were old enough they'd tell your
parents anyway).
</P>
<P>
   You were ever in the homecoming parade.
</P>
<P>
   You have ever gone home for homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   You run to the store for milk and it takes you an hour.
</P>
<P>
   No place sells gas on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night fun consisted of standing in line for the one
screen theater to see a movie that came out six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was cool to date someone from the neighboring town.
</P>
<P>
   You have ever gone for a walk in the cemetery, on a date.
</P>
<P>
   You ordered your wardrobe out of a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   You had senior skip day.
</P>
<P>
   The whole school went to the same party after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   You had to drive an hour to buy a pair of socks.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you decided to walk to school for exercise, 20 cars
pulled over and offered you a lift.
</P>
<P>
   You could set your bookbag out in the hall at lunchtime and it
would still be there when you came out of the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   There were three generations of your family in the same bleacher
row at every home game.
</P>
<P>
   You know everybody in the Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   Your only newspaper was a weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The minimall you now shop at has more stores than your entire
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Loitering isn't a bad thing; it's the only thing.
</P>
<P>
   You refer to THE stop light.
</P>
<P>
   You don't give directions by street names or house numbers, but
by references (''Turn right by Harold's Hardware, go two blocks
past Andersons', and it's the fourth house on the left past the
football field.)
</P>
<P>
   You call lunch dinner, and dinner supper.

 &HT;    For actor Diggs, `Best' roles are those that inspire
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Taye Diggs is showing the effects of a long night in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It's not in the 28-year-old actor's clean-cut look. He could be
an ad for Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch: the smooth, bright green shirt
topping a deep-blue, long-sleeved pullover, the perfectly pressed
tan carpenter pants (the long legs pulled up into nearly
4-inch-high cuffs), the unscuffed coal-black Doc Martens. They
easily help mask all the late-night partying.
</P>
<P>
   It's in his voice where reality creeps through. Didn't he get
any sleep?
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure enough didn't,'' he admits, the words coming slowly as
he sits on a couch in a downtown Ritz-Carlton Hotel suite, hugging
two small accent pillows while talking.
</P>
<P>
   In his first trip to Atlanta recently, Diggs spent most of the
night on the town. The Atlanta Fish Market. A bar or two. Drinks.
Music. The clock struck 3 a.m. _ or, really, sometime after. His
wake-up call came at 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know the name of where we went,'' Diggs confides.
``It was a little bar that played a little music and we had a
couple of drinks. It's a nice town. I'd love to come back. No, I
definitely want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs is here to talk about ``The Best Man,'' his new movie
written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee, cousin of Spike Lee,
opening Friday in metro Atlanta and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Best Man'' in a nutshell: Diggs plays Harper Stewart, a
young writer who reunites with his old college friends for a
wedding, considers rekindling a relationship with his former flame
(Nia Long) and, through his latest book, reveals intimacies that
set his friends reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for things that inspire me, that's got great images,''
Diggs says. ``And especially if it's working with great actors and
great directors. This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of images: Diggs was already known for his infamous
butt shot in ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' In this summer's
``The Wood,'' one scene displayed his chiseled abs. In ``The Best
Man,'' the camera pans slowly up his body as Diggs reclines in a
bathtub full of floating rose petals. Co-star Sanaa Lathan takes
one petal and strokes his chest. At a recent early screening in
Atlanta, the scene made several female moviegoers gasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't lie to you. I go to the gym,'' Diggs says. ``I'm aware
of what you need to be to survive in Hollywood. I'm vain. I take
pride in the way I look. It's all part of the game. And I haven't
reached the point where it's gotten in the way of pure acting.''
</P>
<P>
   _ One of his favorite ``Best Man'' scenes: Diggs, Morris
Chestnut, Harold Perrineau and Terrence Howard do some male bonding
while playing cards. Things unravel after the subject of fidelity
comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intense,'' he says. ``We ran the gamut of emotions. We
were like guffawing on the floor and other times were were really
kind of frightened because Morris' intensity was something none of
us were expecting. None of that was scripted where he knocks over
the table and grabs Terrence. He got up and the table was flying
and there go the beer cans and chips and money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Acting with ghosts in the remake of ``The House on Haunted
Hill,'' opening Oct. 29: ``It was like me and (actress) Ali Larter
acting against ourselves,'' he says. ``We were running and being
chased by this horrible, monstrous thing _ a manifestation of evil
_ that was added in later with a computer. You have to use your
imagination. A lot of times we were just screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The career: In addition to ``Haunted Hill,'' Diggs will
co-star with James Caan and Benicio Del Toro in next year's crime
thriller ``Way of the Gun.'' Previous movies include this year's
``Go,'' ``Mary Jane's Last Dance'' and ``The Wood.'' He co-starred
opposite Angela Bassett in 1998's ``How Stella Got Her Groove
Back.'' On TV, he played Adrian ``Sugar'' Hill on ``The Guiding
Light'' and had guest appearances on ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``New York
Undercover.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The vital stats: Height: 5'8''. State of birth: New Jersey.
Where he grew up: Rochester, N.Y. Siblings: He's the oldest of five
(two brothers are musicians, one sister is a dancer and another
sister is studying to be a veterinarian). School: Graduated with a
bachelor's degree in musical theater from Syracuse University.
Showbiz start: Was a member of the ensemble cast in Broadway's
revival of ``Carousel.'' Also on stage: played Benny, the evil
landlord in ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The daily ab workout: ``It's a general going to the gym and
working out your whole body kind of thing. Reps vary by day.
Sometimes it's machines. I'm a dancer so sometimes it's dance
class. I really work on the lower regions. A lot of it is genetics
_ I thank my mom and dad. I do just the amount I need to do so I
can scrape by.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Why abs aren't really his obsession: ``I'll eat a cupcake as
soon as the next guy. You look in the mirror and you go, 'Well,
that's fine.' I'm not some crazy fanatic that's like every day, I
gotta work out. I do read those magazines. 'What Brad Pitt Does To
Keep In Shape.' It's interesting.
</P>
<P>
   _ The role not taken: ``I won't say the movie, but my agent
wanted me to do this really big budget action movie,'' he says.
``And I was going to get a lot of money to do it. My team is very
well aware that I always want to take care of my family and am
looking for ways to support them. So this opportunity came into my
lap. But I read the script for 'The Best Man' and needless to say
the writing for the action-adventure was nowhere near the writing
for 'Best Man.' So, uh, something in my heart told me to do what I
would have more fun doing.''

 &HT;    Sweets lure public schools into private hands
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ One perusing the wires couldn't pass up this entry
from the Independent of London: ``The Whoring of American
Education.''
</P>
<P>
   It focused on an increasingly common presence in American
schools: corporate advertising. Businesses and products are getting
unlimited access to schools for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A is the increasingly popular notion of selling
multimillion-dollar exclusive vending contracts to companies like
Pepsi or Coke, or essential advertising packages to corporations to
kick in for athletic structures or other hard goods.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B is Channel One, which delivers a morning news
broadcast to 8 million schoolchildren daily, including two minutes
each day of advertising, which helps pay for the free TVs and
satellite dishes schools get.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the Independent didn't get around to Exhibit C, which
is the most glaring example of corporate encroachment: whole
schools being contracted to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   This is most prevalently modeled by the Edison Project, a
private firm which manages 51 schools in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Channel One and the Edison Project were
founded by the same entrepreneur, Chris Whittle. He knows erogenous
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Don't titillate with chocolates. Bring TVs. Don't bring flowers.
Bring computers, in the case of the Edison Project. And watch the
doors open to you.
</P>
<P>
   That would appear to be the case with the Dallas Independent
School District, where new Superintendent Bill Rojas proposes
contracting with the Edison Project to run up to 10 schools. Rojas,
former school superintendent in San Francisco, contracted with
Edison to run an elementary school there.
</P>
<P>
   The success of privatized schools is decidedly mixed, as is the
case with all of the ``wonder drugs'' for education, including
charter schools and vouchers. The major inducement Edison offers
school districts is computers _ home computers for students and
laptops for teachers. Edison also offers classroom phones for
teachers to be in better contact with parents.
</P>
<P>
   This provides an irresistible lure. Teachers groups in Dallas
see their schools underfunded. Understandably and rightfully, they
are suspicious of privatizing schools. But leaders admit it's hard
to resist the candy offered by these strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Taste-tempting gadgets aside, Edison appears to do nothing that
public schools couldn't already do. Supporters say one reason
Edison succeeds is longer school days and longer school years _ 20
more school days on average. But no Texas school district is
prohibited from lengthening classroom time if it thinks that's the
miracle cure.
</P>
<P>
   Note to subscribers: Edison, which has been in existence for
eight years, has yet to make a profit. That's understandable based
on the pricey inducements it offers to get its foot in the door.
Some day Edison will have to make money or it will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   But public schools will remain. The notion of turning to a
private company to run our schools presumes that we as a people
cannot find the will to invest properly in them, that we must find
venture capitalists to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent is alarmed by the wrong commercial venture.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive contracts with Pepsi or Coke are hardly a problem if
they'll help pay for stuff like stadiums and band uniforms. But
signing exclusive contracts with Acme Bros. Educational Concepts to
run our public schools is a troubling one.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, how can educators resist when their communities
can't find the will to act responsibly on public schools' behalf?
</P>
<P>
   So, nice candy. Nice big car. Hop in, children.

   BED-AND-BREAKFAST _ CLEARWATER, Fla. _ ``Now, how would you like
your eggs?'' Eggs? The guests at the Green Gables' table had not
considered such a thing. Already there had been warm banana

   TRAVEL-PICKETTS-MILL _ PICKETT'S MILL, Ga. _ In this leafy
corner of north Georgia, on the fringes of the city men died to
capture and defend in 1864, lies what is probably the single most
unspoiled, most authentic, most evocatively pristine battlefield in
the whole long, fiery struggle during the ``War Of the Rebellion,''
as the victorious North called it. Among Civil War enthusiasts,
Pickett's Mill is unique. It is, in its way, perfect. ``I'm wary of
using the word most or best, but Pickett's Mill is probably the
best-preserved small battlefield for 1864-65, when the soldiers
marched with one hand on the rifle and the other hand on the
shovel,'' said Edwin Bearss, historian emeritus for the National
Park Service and one of the authorities of Civil War
studies.(Browning, Palm Beach Post). MOVED.

   COXNET TRAVEL 1019 -- For any hike into the Black Canyon of the

   TAYEDIGGS _ Interview with Taye Diggs, 28, who stars in the new
comedy/drama ``The Best Man'' about friends who occassionally flash
back to college years before one of the pals gets married. It's a
far different film from this summer's ``The Wood'' (also starring
Diggs). ``Best Man'' is sort of ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' with a
distinct gender-switch. Diggs, earlier seen in ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back,'' has been in Atlanta promoting the film with director
Malcolm Lee (cousin of Spike Lee). Diggs will star later this month
in the new horror remake of ``The House on Haunted Hill.''

GORE URGES BAN ON NEW OIL DRILLING IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, going beyond Clinton
administration policy on the environment, called Thursday for a
total ban on new oil drilling in federal waters off the coasts of
California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposal would enable a Gore administration to
make ``dramatic progress'' toward a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is much more than a policy position to me _ it
is a profoundly moral obligation,'' Gore said in remarks prepared
for delivery via satellite to environmentalists meeting in Los
Angeles. Gore spoke from Rye, N.H., during a campaign swing for his
2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one earth. And if we do not keep it healthy and
safe, every other gift we leave our children will be meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has imposed a 10-year extension of a
moratorium on leasing offshore oil tracts and a permanent ban on
leasing in national marine sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign position goes beyond this policy to halt ``all
new drilling'' in federal waters off California and Florida and to
prohibit drilling new wells in existing oil tract leases held by
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect
our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,'' Gore
said. ``I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the
coast of California and Florida. ... I will do everything in my
power to make sure that there is no new drilling off these
sensitive coasts _ even in areas already leased for drilling by
previous administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rubin, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
Gore's proposed ban would force American oil companies to shift
their new drilling abroad. This would make the United States more
dependent on foreign sources of oil and gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that because we are limited in our
access to federal lands, the companies are forced to spend their
exploration budgets overseas and this is going to simply further
that,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by Gore's campaign noted that the state of
California, led by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, has raised concerns
about proposed new drilling off the coast. The Interior Department
has requested additional information from the oil companies
proposing new exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida, led by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a GOP candidate for president in
2000, has determined that proposed drilling off the Florida coast
``would be inconsistent with its coastal zone management plan,''
the Gore statement said. Chevron has appealed Florida's decision to
Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am placing environmental protection at the very heart of my
campaign for the presidency,'' Gore said. ``I will have no higher
priority as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.H., in
his bid to succeed Clinton as president. Gore's announcement may
help energize his natural constituency among environmentalists in
California, a key battleground with a presidential primary on March
7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey conducted for Cable News Network and USA
Today by the Gallup Poll that concluded on Oct. 10 showed Gore's
lead over Bradley shrinking to 12 percentage points, 51 percent to
39 percent. A survey in September showed Gore leading Bradley by 33
percentage points, 63 percent to 30 percent.

<P>
   Clinton announced a 10-year extension of the federal ban on new
oil and gas drilling off the nation's East and West coasts during a
visit to Monterey, Calif., on June 13, 1998. Clinton's compromise
position, seeking to balance environmental protection with the
economic interests of energy companies, disappointed some
environmental activists who had been seeking a permanent ban on oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., expressed disappointment at the
time. ``Our coastline deserves protection forever,'' said Boxer,
noting that Clinton's announcement moved the nation down ``the path
toward permanent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium on new offshore drilling initially had been
imposed in 1990 by President George Bush, for 10 years ending in
2000.

`BOYS DON'T CRY' TELLS SORDID BUT MESMERIZING TALE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The story of Brandon Teena, a young Nebraska woman
who was convinced _ and convinced many people around her _ that she
was really a boy, has been gone over in numerous articles and a
television documentary. There has been something missing from most
of this coverage, something ``Boys Don't Cry'' seeks to supply.
</P>
<P>
   The movie comes within spitting distance of illuminating the
whole, sordidly fascinating story, or at least shrewdly speculating
on it. In the process, director and co-writer Kimberly Peirce
proves herself an astonishingly gifted filmmaker, already in full
command of performance and picture on her first feature.
</P>
<P>
   But even played by an actress as emotionally free and
chameleonlike as Hilary Swank, Brandon remains a bit of an enigma.
Inevitable, perhaps; how can we ever explain a person whose need to
deceive was so intimately and inexplicably intertwined with her
need for love? Still, something's lacking in the portrayal of
Brandon _ call it a conscience _ that most reports have overlooked
due to her status as a hate crime casualty.
</P>
<P>
   But that's something that nags you after the film is over. While
it's playing, the movie is all but mesmerizing, so thoroughly does
it detail dead-end heartland life and dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the story, Brandon Teena was really
Teena Brandon, a congenital liar with a whopping case of gender
confusion. She'd cut her hair, bind her breasts, stick a sock in
her jeans and pick up girls in Lincoln bars. This generally
resulted in getting chased by angry brothers, and the cops were no
kinder when they'd catch her vandalizing cars or forging checks.
</P>
<P>
   One night, she escaped to tiny Falls City, about 75 miles down a
flat, empty highway. There, in her Brandon persona, she quickly
made friends with two young ex-cons, John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard)
and Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III), and somehow convinced half
the teen-age girls in town that she was their dream boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how crude and violent the indigenous male population
was, the delusions made a kind of sense. The film limits Brandon's
romantic escapades pretty much to one girl, Lana Tisdell, who is
beautifully played here by Chloe Sevigny with all the headstrong
longing and guarded vulnerability a teen-ager in love can possess.
The real-life Tisdale _ and you may want to skip the rest of this
paragraph if you're unfamiliar with the case and wish to be
surprised _ is reportedly considering legal action against the
filmmakers, who place her at the scene of Teena's murder, among
other acts of artistic license.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brandon-Lana relationship forms the film's heart,
there is abundant life in every corner of ``Boys Don't Cry.''
Peirce and her actors capture the wayward existence of smalltown
outcasts with uncanny perception. With the help of cinematographer
Jim Denault, she also displays an uncanny instinct for when and how
to place a camera in the midst of volatile groups, where the
dynamic can turn violent in the blink of an eye and no one _
especially if they're pretending to be something they're not _ can
relax.
</P>
<P>
   As good as everyone is here, Swank inevitably steals the show. A
former ``Beverly Hills 90210'' regular, of all things, she not only
makes us forget that Brandon is a woman, Swank turns us into
co-conspirators in her gleeful, dangerous masquerade. We feel what
Brandon feels, from paranoia to exhilaration to devastation and
terror.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing we don't feel is a real sense of guilt. Sure,
Brandon apologizes when she's confronted with the truth and
threatened with grievous harm, but it hardly seems heartfelt.
Brandon was clearly no sociopath _ she was too emotionally needy _
and as long as Peirce and company were changing facts and inventing
some behavior, they should have addressed the most obvious conflict
in Brandon's confused life.
</P>
<P>
   Victim of narrowmindedness, homophobia and identity crisis she
inarguably was. But just because that will be enough to jerk
sympathy from all enlightened, right-thinking people, it's still a
shame to rob Brandon Teena of a soul. &QL;

SCORSESE, ACTORS TALK ABOUT `BRINGING OUT THE DEAD'

because I discovered that he really allows the actors to create,''
says Nicolas Cage of his work making ``Bringing Out the Dead'' with

By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Martin Scorsese has developed a top-signature
ensemble in his films over the years, represented by such
pyrotechnic New York types as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Harvey
Keitel.
</P>
<P>
   But for his latest feature, ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' the
legendary director opted to work with a set of different faces.
Some, such as intense and unpredictable Nicolas Cage and
Harlem-bred tough guy Ving Rhames, seem as if they should have been
making Scorsese films for years instead of for the first time.
Others, including the very California Patricia Arquette, affable
and easygoing John Goodman and salsa/pop superstar Marc Anthony,
you wouldn't immediately connect with the director's edgy nightmare
vision.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Bringing Out the Dead'' is certainly that. Based on Joe
Connelly's fact-based novel of his early '90s stint as a Manhattan
paramedic, the film is already being called ``Ambulance Driver'' in
reference to Scorsese's and screenwriter Paul Schrader's '70s
classic of urban dysfunction, ``Taxi Driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Cage plays another one of the artist's cracked Christ figures,
Frank, a Hell's Kitchen emergency medical technician who learns
it's hard to be a saint in the city. Too many of his charges have
died, and the guilt is driving him over the edge during a weekend
of all-night runs. Goodman and Rhames are fellow ambulance
attendants who deal with their own near-breakdowns by,
respectively, hiding behind cynicism and exuberantly embracing
faith and the nearest available female.
</P>
<P>
   Arquette's Mary, the daughter of a dying man, is a former drug
addict who could slip back into oblivion if she can't be saved by _
or save _ somebody, hopefully Frank. Or, perhaps, Anthony's Noel, a
brain-damaged street casualty whom Mary grew up with and Frank
constantly tries to help, but whose near-hopeless dementia is
symbolized by a mop of unruly dreadlocks and the bizarre coat of
cables he wears for protection.
</P>
<P>
   For all of these actors, working for the man generally
considered the best director of his time was more heavenly than
hellish. And Scorsese, too, seems to have been charged by the
experience, as proven by the energetic, funny, outrageous and even
transcendent takes on his favorite themes that breathe exciting
life into ``Bringing Out the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following conversations, Scorsese and the actors discuss
the happy collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   NICOLAS CAGE &QC; 
``Nic was the first person I thought of to do the piece, because of
his face and his eyes,'' Scorsese reveals, ``and the chances that
he takes and the sense that he could give me of the feeling of the
world being weighed on his shoulders _ though it shouldn't be, but
he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was somebody to really learn from, I felt, because I admire
so many of his films, and I recognize him as a master of cinema,''
says Cage, himself the nephew of master filmmaker Francis Ford
Coppola. ``But he's also got, very much, the spirit of a student.
He's passionate about film in every aspect and will be happy to
talk to you, on any level, about every kind of movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual director-actor experience was interesting, because
I discovered that he really allows the actors to create, and if
it's working, he will not call attention to it. If it isn't, then
he'll say something, but he doesn't want you to become
self-conscious. He'll say, `Action,' and we'll try it six times in
a row before a cut. He did that because _ and, I guess, what I
really learned from him is that _ you don't want to overthink
things. You don't want the thought process to constipate the flow
of the acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like this rapid-fire, spontaneous run, and I think
that's one of the reasons why his performances have that
electricity to them that seems so fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   PATRICIA ARQUETTE &QC; 
``She had just gone through medical crises with her parents, so we
had all that there to touch upon,'' Scorsese says. ``It was very
delicate and a little upsetting. The way she delivers lines was
very interesting to me, because she knew what was going on _ you
didn't have to tell her much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In moments like that, I go into the rescuer mode,'' explains
Arquette, whose mother died six months before production started,
and whose father was hospitalized through the early part of the
shoot. ``I go into the control, take-care-of-business mode. So it's
not easy for me to feel my feelings in emergency situations in my
life. But this was like a gift for me to express the way I was
really feeling _ how trapped and powerless and frustrated I felt _
a luxury I don't give myself in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, I didn't want to leave my dressing room. I was
terrified, like performance anxiety. There are certain people in
life that you think maybe won't notice you're a big fraud, but you
think somebody great like Marty is going to see through you. It was
like trying to make a painting in front of Van Gogh, but he was
very kind and generous. When I'd get frustrated, he'd say, `You
know what? We're here, we're ready, we have all day. If you want to
go walk around for an hour ... whatever you need to do.' That's
what he gives to his actors _ whatever you need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   VING RHAMES &QC; 
``Ving told me that he saw this guy as kind of being retro,''
Scorsese recalls. ``I said OK, and then he sent me some pictures of
guys like Joe Louis, Nat King Cole, the Ink Spots. I said, `Hey,
Joe Louis!' And he says, `Yeah, that's what I was thinking. But I
also see him with a little paunch.' So I said, `Go ahead, put it
on, don't worry about it.' And I think he patterned the accent
after some old person he knew from a barbershop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty is an actor's dream,'' says Rhames, known for memorable
turns in ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Rosewood'' and as Don King on HBO.
``He sets up a very creative environment, but I call it a
structured freedom that he gives you. He allowed me to flesh out
the character, add nuances and a lot of things that were not in the
script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with this whole, church kind of healing thing that
happens in a Goth club. The scene was written that they go and
revive this guy who OD'd, but all the, well, whatever I said, that
definitely wasn't in there. Anything religious-related was put in
by me.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN GOODMAN &QC; 
``John just comes on the set and lights it up, people love him,''
Scorsese says, slightly awestruck. ``He's just one of those people,
I don't know what it is _ has a great sense of humor. Perfect to
pair with Nic in the scenes, improvising with Nic but lightening it
up while they're both getting a little cabin fever. It was so
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a talent for judging people, knows who to blend
together, who is going to work together and how to push their
buttons to get the performances that he needs,'' confirms Goodman,
whose film appearances have been nonstop since the hit ``Roseanne''
sitcom ran its course. ``He's an artist. It was a career goal to
work for him, and it was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he knows everything. He knows EVERYTHING, rock n' roll
stuff, everything. He has such a joy and passion for what he does
that he brings it to everyone else. Just enthusiasm. And he's one
of the lucky people who can visualize what they want and then
capture it exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   MARC ANTHONY &QC; 
``His character was originally written as an African-American, but
my casting director brought this guy in,'' Scorsese reveals. ``He
had a great face, eyes beautiful, very small build, vulnerable ...
The guy started reading, and he was great. He had never done
anything quite like that before, so it was really physically
demanding for him.'' ``It was, physically, the most challenging
thing I've ever done,'' says the hit recording artist, whose acting
experience includes small roles in the films ``Big Night'' and
``The Substitute,'' and the lead in Paul Simon's aborted Broadway
musical ``The Capeman.'' ``Think about it; the character walked
around in body armor he made of electrical cable, and it weighs 40
pounds. I don't weigh that much!
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was up for the challenge. One thing that Marty told me
that stood out was that Noel was the soul of the movie. So I knew
that he had to be quirky but harmless. He was scary, but there was
a soft side to him. I was aware the whole time of how important the
character was supposed to be. It was scary, but Marty has a way of
making you feel that you wouldn't be there if you weren't capable
of doing it. He had just this soft touch about him that banished
all doubt.''

A NEW LEE CROSSES FILMMAKING THRESHOLD WITH `THE BEST MAN'

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A mature romantic comedy about people behaving
immaturely, ``The Best Man'' boasts an irrepressible sense of fun
and an even sharper instinct for when to get serious.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble piece marks the feature directing debut of Malcolm
D. Lee, who also wrote its script. He's the cousin of Spike Lee,
who produced the picture and upon whose films Malcolm has often
worked. Their styles could hardly be more different: Malcolm's is
relaxed and reflective, as opposed to his cousin's agitated and
incendiary approach. But they both go in for intelligent
characterizations, and a strong narrative desires to get down to
the truth of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' sports elements of both ``The Big Chill'' and
the recent ``The Wood,'' but only superficially in that it's an
upscale college reunion story built around an African-American
wedding. Similarities end there, as a number of intriguing people
find their relationships with one another gradually _ then more
rapidly _ spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The central character is Taye Diggs' Harper Stewart, a Chicago
writer whose first novel _ which is a thinly veiled recollection of
university days _ is about to be published. He's in New York for
the marriage of best friend Lance (``Boyz N the Hood's'' Morris
Chestnut), now a professional football star, and Monica Calhoun's
Mia, who used to work with him on the school newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's not-quite-committed-to girlfriend, Robin (Sanaa
Lathan), will arrive in two days for the wedding. Complications
have been pre-initiated by Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long of ``Hood,''
``Soul Food'' and ``Love Jones'' acclaim), Harper's old study
partner and almost flame. Now a driven talk-show producer, she has
obtained an advance copy of the novel, which has somehow gotten
passed around to two other college chums: Murch (Harold Perrineau),
who doesn't know what to do with either his law degree or his
manipulative, high-maintenance girlfriend Shelby (Melissa DeSousa),
and Quentin (Terrence Howard), a talented, trash-talking ladies'
man who can't seem to settle on any career path at all.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the book contains revelations _ fictionalized but
revelatory nonetheless about true feelings and secret betrayals
from back in the day. The last thing Harper wanted was for Lance to
read any of it before the ceremony. One guess how Lance chooses to
take his mind off prewedding jitters. It's the trick with these
kinds of stories to orchestrate people's desires and
misunderstandings into ever higher-stakes confrontations and
ultimatums, and Lee whips up some doozies on that front.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Best Man'' is also very much about confronting painful
truths, both about one's intimates and oneself. Rarely has such a
wide range of individuals genuinely grown as much in one movie as
the folks in this one do _ or fire off as much sassy, uproarious
dialogue in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Lee takes his time building up characters and their
relationships, which is admirable but a tricky task he's not quite
mastered yet. A few scenes early on go nowhere and do very little
in the way of developing the story. And while the
Harper-Jordan-Lance trajectories are rich in complex connections
and funny incidents, other characters, though often vivid, are
sometimes limited to caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Overall though, Lee has made a very impressive first feature and
revitalized a tired story structure with style and personality
distinctively his own.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Show Me Love'' shares with a dozen or so films
of recent vintage the archetypal gay teen fantasy: young person
comfortable with his/her sexuality, if not much else, ultimately
brings around cutest classmate of the same gender. The difference
here is that it's small-town Swedish girls, and their behavior is
as credible as the fantasy is cliched.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes (Rebecca Liljeberg) has lived in Amal, a Scandinavian
Nowheresville, for about a year, and in that time has made exactly
one friend, a girl in a wheelchair whom she really doesn't like.
That doesn't stop her mom from planning a big sweet 16 party; Agnes
is mortified when Mother insists she pass out invitations to the
disinterested kids at school. Rumor has already spread that Agnes,
though still a virgin, leans the lesbian way.
</P>
<P>
   And it's true; the diary she keeps on her home computer is
filled with pinings for Elin (Alexandra Dahlstrom), a beautiful
blond 14-year-old with her own exaggerated reputation for sexual
adventurousness. Neither girl has a very happy home life, although
Agnes' sensitive dad tries to understand her (without really
understanding anything), and Elin and her contentious sister
Jessica (Erica Carlson) would maybe get along better if their
overworked, single mom could give them more quality time.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Elin and Jessica wind up at Agnes' on their way to the
evening's real party, and Elin kisses Agnes on a dare. Feeling
guilty _ and maybe something else _ Elin returns late that night,
drunk and disgusted with the boys she's just messed with, to
apologize. There's a spark that Elin spends most of the movie
trying to convince herself meant nothing. Confused, Agnes just gets
angrier.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the most memorable aspect of ``Show Me Love'' is
indeed the quicksilver rage both girls express. Elin is bored and
jaded and just smart enough not to want to end up like her mother
or older sister _ and secretly terrified by any real chance to get
away from Amal, or at least from its soul-deadening conventions.
Agnes, naturally, sees nothing fair about her existence, and of
course she's right. Then again, they may just be two petulant,
self-dramatizing teen-agers, a possibility that the movie wisely
keeps in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Less wise was writer-director Lukas Moodysson's decision to
shoot the film on grainy, reversal film stock, with a lot of
cheesy, TV-style zoom-lens antics. While this is not exactly the
same filming philosophy as the Dogme '95 school that's taken hold
in nearby Denmark, it nonetheless seems to be part of a perverse
Scandinavian movement to make movies that look unnecessarily ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he felt that was a better way to underscore the
emptiness that surrounds these two troubled, though hardly hopeless
girls. Moodysson builds their small, constricted world with the
same detailed efficiency (the witless guys who date the sisters
and, tellingly and amusingly, like to brag about which has the
smallest, thinnest cell phone) that the actresses employ to flesh
out their difficult characters. All this makes ``Show Me Love'' a
cut above your average gay teen romance. A more imaginative plot
line would have made it really remarkable.

CANNED PUMPKIN MAKES BAKING AS EASY AS PIE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you want pumpkin puree, you can buy a pumpkin,
wash it, cut it in half, scrape out the seeds and fiberous strings,
place the halves in a roasting pan and bake for about an hour at
325 degrees and then scrape the pulp out of the shell.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you can open a can.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs advise taking the easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm a firm believer in using everything fresh, but
for the home cook, canned pumpkin isn't a bad product,'' says
Patrick Lofton, executive chef at Longfellows in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you buy a quality name-brand, packed pumpkin, and as
long as the can is in good shape, the pumpkin should be just fine,
Lofton says.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Plummer, chef and owner of the Allegro Cafe in Troy, also
uses canned pumpkin, but he reads the labels carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself like to use the plain canned pumpkin,'' says Plummer,
``not the seasoned canned mix. I want to be responsible for doing
the seasonings. Use your own head to flavor it, the way you want it
to be flavored.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs suggest looking for cans labeled ``100 percent
pumpkin'' so you know that you're getting. Other than that, buying
pumpkin is as easy as, well, pie.

DOSE OF COMPETITION KEEPS LIVE OPERA ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How often can I forget that times change and
``market forces'' dictate when and how?
</P>
<P>
   When San Francisco radio station KDFC-FM announced it would not
carry the 1999-2000 ``Live from the Met'' opera season, I was as
mad as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, from early December to late
April, my Saturdays have been synonymous with Texaco's full-length
Metropolitan Opera broadcasts. Whether I was cleaning house,
running errands or just running (with radio headphones), I listened
to the opera from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Always during the broadcast, when I'd hear the scrape of stage
furniture, a prolonged pause between musical sections or just a
cough in the audience, a delicious thrill would run through me.
</P>
<P>
   This was LIVE. The real thing. Happening 3,000 miles away in
Lincoln Center. No retakes. No dubbing, no mixing, no digital
enhancing. Just the raw, exciting, scary, no-net leap that is a
live opera performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mess with that magic? I was ready to picket the radio station's
offices and boycott all of their annoying and noisy commercial
sponsors. And I wasn't alone. KDFC program director Bill Lueth said
that since the station announced it could not come to terms with
the Met, he has been ``harangued by listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are threatening to call the FCC to try and have our
license lifted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, the FCC lifts licenses for malfeasance or
irresponsibility; neither is at work in the KDFC-Met divorce. If
anything, Lueth _ a former operatic bass-baritone with graduate
degrees in opera _ probably tried harder than most radio executives
would have to cut a deal with the Met.
</P>
<P>
   You want to blame somebody for no more live Met on KDFC? Blame
Alan Greenspan or anyone who has contributed to our highly
competitive, market-driven economy. Blame capitalism and free
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, when Bonneville International Corp. bought KDFC
and promised it would retain the station's classical music format,
the Salt Lake City company was a hero. The big money in radio was
not in Bach or Mahler, but in talk or all-news. For music stations,
the bucks were in lite rock.
</P>
<P>
   Bonneville may be Mormon-owned, but it's no nonprofit. For
commercial radio stations to ``stay competitive'' (or just
survive), they must hold their own in the ad wars. Sponsors don't
care what you air, just so long as your audience consists mostly of
money-spending 24- to 54-year-olds who can be blasted with 10
commercial spots per hour.
</P>
<P>
   When your format is van Halen or Tony Orlando and Dawn, you have
no problem. When it's symphonies in four movements or operas in
four acts, something's gotta give.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for sponsors with rock stations and easy listening,
KDFC transformed its format from serious classical into what some
of us derisively call ``classical lite.'' A cut here from
``Romantic Adagio,'' a Chopin nocturne there, the 25th rendition in
a week of ``The Moldau.''
</P>
<P>
   This format has hooked 100,000 new listeners into the 102.7 FM
spot, according to Lueth, and thus achieved something almost no
commercial classical station has these days: financial viability.
(The fact that no public, nonprofit station has rushed to fill the
Bay Area's classical music void speaks volumes about how few
programmers are courting the purist classical music audience.)
</P>
<P>
   The rub with the Met: Classical lite and the nation's premiere
opera company are not a great mix.
</P>
<P>
   The Met, which pays stations to air its shows, not the other way
around, is committed to live broadcasts; Texaco has sponsored them
since 1940. Steeped in power and tradition, the company will not
permit tape-delayed broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Like WCRB in Boston, which also dropped the Met operas this
season, KDFC's marketing surveys tell them that opera fans are a
small part of their audience. Saturdays, between 10 a.m. and 3
p.m., when ``Live from the Met'' airs, is prime time in the world
of classical lite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio has changed,'' Lueth said. ``The old idea of different
four-hour formats doesn't work anymore. You have to be consistent
and give listeners what they expect, 24 hours a day. You certainly
have to give it to them in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, for us opera niche types, free-market forces
sometimes give as well as take away. Saturdays, between 10 and 3,
are not prime time for everyone. Palo Alto station KBZS-AM (1220)
announced this week that it is only too happy to take the Met's
money and air ``Live from the Met.'' The first broadcast is ``The
Marriage of Figaro,'' Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The irony: KBZS's usual format is financial and business news.

NOW SHOWING: THE GREAT ESCAPE FROM REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first rule of the Flight Club is you don't
talk about the Flight Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Flight Club meets in the middle of the day at the Sony
Metreon's 11-screen cineplex, within walking distance of most of
the office buildings in San Francisco. I'm sitting with a few dozen
escapee office workers, mostly male, watching Brad Pitt and Ed
Norton kick some yuppie butt in ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   We're kicking some butt, too. We fled work for a couple of hours
on some excuse or another, like being on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, my editor did recommend ``Fight Club'' over ``American
Beauty,'' which I'd seen already anyway. I took that as an order to
get right on it.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``American Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' are the
same movie, with different titrations of testosterone. In both
movies, a submissive white male office worker rebels against the
middle-class world instead of, say, slipping out of work to watch a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' both tell the age-old
American story of boy meets inner boy, tells boss to take that job
and shove it, then lights out for the territories of the mind and
ends up with his brains blown out by a semiautomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to give away the plot of both movies, but the movies do it
themselves at the beginning anyway. It's all in the acting, the
nuances, the writing and the great escapist choice between sex and
violence or violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-ish office worker played by Kevin Spacey in ``American
Beauty'' drools over a teen-age cheerleader, while the 30-ish
office worker played by Ed Norton in ``Fight Club'' favors
homoerotic bloody fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who's more mature? That's right. It's us, the members of
the Flight Club, certified R-rated mature audiences in darkened
rooms having popcorn and wish-fulfillment for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, if you tell your boss to shove it, you need a better
blackmail scheme than either Spacey or Norton concoct to get a
golden parachute.
</P>
<P>
   If you make time with an underage cheerleader, you should be
ready to do the time. And only in movies would she look at a
balding old guy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I liked the first half of ``Fight Club'' for
its sick humor about testicular cancer support groups. I enjoyed
``American Beauty'' mainly for the conversation that followed.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any conversation after ``Fight Club.'' All the guys
walked silently out of the theater, surreptitiously checking each
other out for scars or tell-tale signs of wimphood.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' on the other hand, is this year's talker
movie.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked about it with a leather-clad Harley rider I see some
mornings at Peet's coffeehouse. I've talked about it with
stockbrokers, writers and my wife _ who didn't especially like the
movie except for its acting and as something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   People have their favorite Kevin Spacey lines, like when he
raises his fist in the air and says, ``I rule!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's the ultimate boy line, and it's all in how he says it.
He's a great actor and he was at the peak of his form.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who like to talk about the moral lessons of
the movie. Just for starters, the high school kid next door is the
only thoroughly grounded character with a job he likes _ being a
drug peddler.
</P>
<P>
   All right, there aren't any moral lessons.
</P>
<P>
   As one African-American woman put it, ```American Beauty' is
about white men's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but white men's problems have such a rich tradition in the
movies, from talkers like ``American Beauty'' to grunters like
``Fight Club,'' back to such masterpieces of white male alienation
as ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Five Easy Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   I loved both movies. I also liked ``Fight Club,'' until the
fight clubbers went completely fascist, trying to undermine
American society by destroying public art, trashing franchise
coffeehouses and smashing BMWs with baseball bats.
</P>
<P>
   When I flee work for the Flight Club, I don't want to see
anything that looks remotely like real life in San Francisco.

   LOS ANGELES _  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most things about Vegas superstars Siegfried &AMP; Roy, their
new IMAX 3-D movie is as dazzling as it is hokey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy: The Magic Box'' is tricked up with all kinds
of comin'-at-ya, computer-generated effects that are supposed to
evoke a sense of magic being all around us in life. Sometimes they
do, but more often they remind you of those old ``Monty Python''
collage interludes, only more expensive and not as witty.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the movie, as is the case with S&AMP;R's stage
spectaculars, is any of it that involves big cats. The white tigers
and lions that the showmen have been so instrumental in preserving
are magnificent, even more so in gargantu-o 3-D _ and even more
captivating in footage showing them at home with the guys,
frolicking amid the whacky splendor of S&AMP;R's tropical
paradise-themed estate.
</P>
<P>
   Also like the stage act, there's not enough time spent with the
cats. The main thrust of this movie, I think, is to tell the story
of two unhappy German boys who found escape in magic tricks
(Siegfried) and communing with animals (Roy), and then found each
other. It's hard to tell, though, since the narrative keeps jumping
around in time and focus, with snippets of biographical
re-creation, bits from the stage show, those weird mechanistic
effects and portentous narration by Anthony Hopkins all intermixed
and flashed around in an over-edited jumble.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Brett Leonard, played similar games with coherence
in his feature films, ``Virtuosity'' and ``The Lawnmower Man.''
Anyway, the legend goes that Siegfried and Roy grew up in families
that were emotionally shattered by the war, met on a cruise ship
where Siegfried was pulling rabbits out of hats and Roy had stowed
away his pet cheetah, and by combining their two interests into one
unusual act started down the magical road to living their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Nice for them, nice for the animals, nice to look at. A little
superficial and pretty darn corny? You bet. But hey, it's big and
it's dazzling, and Leonard at least films the magic acts in
360-degree uninterrupted shots, which makes them more impressive
than anything David Copperfield has done in his fixed-camera
specials. ``Magic Box'' will have its pointers and detractors, but
this trick has worked so well for so long, how could anyone really
want to spoil it? &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the face of it, ``Crazy in Alabama'' looks like
a vanity project on the order of ``Ishtar'' and ``Hudson Hawk,''
only less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Banderas directs wife Melanie Griffith in a period piece
for Columbia Pictures, the studio that wants Banderas to don a
black mask again for a ``Zorro'' sequel. Banderas has never
directed, and the movie's Southern setting would seem a bit of a
reach for him. Factor in Griffith's recent spotty track record, and
you've got a sure-fire stinker, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. It turns out Banderas has a pretty good eye, both for
American mores and for framing a movie. ``Crazy in Alabama'' isn't
a monumental film by any means, but it's a winning work of small
charms and praise-worthy performances, including another fine turn
from young actor Lucas Black (``Sling Bade'').
</P>
<P>
   Set in the summer of 1965, the movie interweaves two stories
revolving around the issue of freedom. First there's Lucille
(Griffith), a glamorous Southern belle who murders her abusive
husband so she can go to Hollywood (with her spouse's head in a
Tupperware container) and become a TV star. Back home in backwoods
Alabama, Lucille's nephew, Peejoe (Black), confronts racial
prejudice personified in the form of a bigoted sheriff
(singer-actor Meat Loaf Aday). Lucille's radical act seems to
inspire various family members, including her brother, Dove (David
Morse), a mortuary owner who has spent his life conforming to his
town's intolerant practices. ``That's just the way things are,''
Dove tells Peejoe when the boy asks about segregation. Soon,
however, both Dove and Peejoe must decide if such unmindful
acceptance comes with a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting his own lauded novel for the screen, Mark Childress
achieves a fairly successful blend of social history, biting humor
and Southern Gothic seasonings. Banderas isn't always successful in
moving between the parallel plotlines (we often want to stay with
the Griffith story), but he shows some promise _ when not resorting
to film school tricks. (Go easy on the slow motion next time,
Antonio.)
</P>
<P>
   The film sputters a bit at the end, dragged down by a
standard-issue courtroom scene. ``Crazy'' goes a little far, too,
in excusing murder in the name of personal freedom and a TV career.
(Latest film trend: bad husband killings.) It's also difficult to
buy Griffith as a mother of seven _ her relationship with that
brood never seems remotely believable because the script rarely
bothers much with the young'uns.
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``Crazy in Alabama'' does manage to get some things
right. So, as vanity goes, it's pretty fair. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Crazy in Alabama'' (PG-13; some violence, thematic
material, language and a scene of sensuality). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Melanie Griffith, Lucas Black, David Morse, Meat Loaf
Aday. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Antonio Banderas. Screenplay by
Mark Childress, based on his novel. Released by Columbia
Pictures. &UR;  &QL; 
Running time: &LR;  One hour, 48 minutes. &UR;  &QL;

COMPANY TO PROVIDE EVENTS, E-MAIL AT FREE TERMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ An Internet company hopes to tap the
technology-savvy residents of this university town by providing 62
free electronic mail terminals that will be unveiled Friday at
restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace will ply customers with 10 minutes of free e-mail
and an on-line magazine featuring local events and entertainment
from a terminal that resembles a futuristic parking meter. Instead
of reaching the Web when users log on, ``Street Lincs'' will
connect them to a private network providing entertainment articles
and access to any e-mail address in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want quick and speedy access when they are out on the
street and looking for things to do,'' said Lisa Joss, spokeswoman
for the San Francisco-based company. ``They don't want to spend a
lot of time doing research on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Joss said the magazine, which will supply video and text, was
geared toward the college-dominated demographics of Berkeley, home
to a University of California campus. She said the Canadian-born
founder of Streetspace, Tom Mathai, had chosen Berkeley as the
launch site for the company because of its small, creative, urban
atmosphere and its population's familiarity with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber cafes, where patrons can send e-mail or log on to the Web
from a coffeehouse computer, have been around since the commercial
inception of the Internet several years ago, but they typically
charge for Internet access. With Streetspace, customer will use
passes that look like phone cards. The passes are available from
businesses that offer the Web terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Street Linc idea has potential, but is not
without precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all surprised by it; recently, we've seen more and
more of the giving away of free PCs or e-mail or a phone in return
for enduring some kind of advertising,'' said Florian Zettelmeyer,
a marketing professor who teachers an Internet strategy course at
UC-Berkeley's Haas School of Business. ``They (the companies)
reduce the hurdle of using the service and then impose some cost on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Joss said Street Lincs would eventually be supported by
advertising and would use its e-mail system to learn about users'
interests and the kind of consumer information they desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do surveys and questionnaires, and if people want
information about a topic like ski wear or snow boards, we'll give
it to them,'' Joss said. ``But we will never give advertisers names
and information about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ross, owner of Berkeley landmark Cody's Books, agreed to
harbor a terminal, but reserved judgment about the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a good idea, but so much of this stuff is going
around these days, it's hard to know what will pan out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he did not believe Street Lincs or other on-line media
would infringe on the printed page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real magazines and books are a tenacious medium,'' Ross said.
``It is a technology that has been unsurpassed in many ways.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Three to Tango'' relies on story devices as old
as literature itself _ a love triangle and a case of mistaken
identity, for example _ but it is packaged so cleverly and
presented by such a talented cast that those cliches can be
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the romantic comedy is ``In &AMP; Out'' stood on its
ear: A truly straight man, for a time, allows the public to
perceive him as gay until he ``comes out of the closet'' and
unashamedly admits his heterosexuality in the interest of truth.
</P>
<P>
   And it contains a dollop of ``Some Like It Hot,'' with a
desirable young woman pouring her heart out to that ``gay'' man
because she sees him as only a friend, not another man who wants
her body.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Perry plays Oscar Novak, a professionally insecure
architect in business with Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), who
happens to be homosexual. Steinberg and Novak decide to shoot for
big game by pitching Chicago tycoon Charles Newman (Dylan
McDermott) for the privilege of designing a multimillion-dollar
cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, the kind of sleek scoundrel who probably pulled wings
off insects as a boy, decides to pit Steinberg and Novak against
their mega-successful rivals, Decker and Strauss (John C. McGinley
and Bob Balaban) for the job in a well-publicized contest.
</P>
<P>
   Based on innocent shows of affection, miscommunication (``well,
you know'') and malicious disinformation from Decker and Strauss,
Newman mistakenly concludes that Oscar Novak is gay. Newman
capitalizes on Oscar's puppyish eager-to-please attitude by
assigning him the task of keeping his mistress, Amy Post (Neve
Campbell), out of another man's arms while the tycoon is being a
dutiful husband.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Santostefano, in his feature directing debut, has given
the gender-bender notion a fresh treatment by letting his cast find
humor within their characters and specific situations rather than
in exaggerated buffoonery.
</P>
<P>
   One might presume that the responsibility for delivering laughs
rests on comic veterans Perry and Platt. However, McDermott and
Campbell, both famous for their dramatic TV work (his on ``The
Practice,'' hers on ``Party of Five''), show surprising gifts for
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's Oscar is a nicer, less cynical version of Chandler Bing,
his ``Friends'' role, and there's nothing wrong with that. His
history of failed relationships, handled as back story, and his
klutzy physical comedy make Oscar endearing, even while he is
carrying on the big ruse.
</P>
<P>
   Perry wisely avoids the caricature that many other straight
characters pretending to be gay have lapsed into: the stereotypical
raging queen. The homosexuality is handled with plain dialogue, not
with affected mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and Perry have great chemistry from the night the
characters meet and have their first ill-fated date. One of their
best scenes together is when Campbell's Amy, mid-bubble bath,
divulges a sexual secret, and Oscar feigns casual interest while
he's really somewhere between rapture and agony. Perry doesn't need
to whimper ``I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay,'' a la Jack Lemmon; you
know he's thinking it, and that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's laugh, which in ``Three to Tango'' comes as easily as
the tears flow on ``Party of Five,'' is infectious. She plays the
young glass artist as wounded but not self-pitying, a woman who
accepts love-'em-and-leave-'em men as a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott plays the self-absorbed tycoon to a T, throwing his
weight around with a confident strut and at the same time
displaying a catalog of phobias. Despite that strong, angular jaw
and piercing gaze used so effectively for both roles, Newman
couldn't possibly be any further from Bobby Donnell of ``The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt, a master of broad comedy, is every bit as funny when he
lets his eyes do the talking. His reactions often come in a subtle
but telling shrug or twitch of an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   The playful yet sophisticated tone of the movie is set in the
opening titles, with three silhouetted swing dancers jumping and
jiving through a storytelling (BEGIN ITAL)pas de trois(END ITAL). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Three to Tango'' (PG-13; sex-related situations,
language). &UR;  &QL;

   &UR; TRUE LOVE MAY LAST FOREVER, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG

</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world has come to mean, in the popular
imagination, romantic love almost exclusively. But it may come as a
surprise to learn that the very concept of ``love'' based on
emotion as a high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is
relatively new in the history of mankind. In the ancient world,
romantic love would seem to have been virtually unknown, and rarely
celebrated. Our generic term ``love'' didn't exist. The sentiment
of romantic love as we know it was the homoerotic love of older
Greek men for boys. Marital love, which surely existed, seems oddly
not to have been much honored, at least in surviving literature.

   Why does Heloise, a reluctant, heartbroken nun, stand out among

shameless intelligence, which won her the right to be treated as a

her gifts as a classical logician. It is because of her lifelong
refusal to condemn or forget the pleasures of a passion that ruined
her life.

   Richard Strauss knew that love triangles make the best music,
and proved it in ``Der Rosenkavalier.'' At the opera's penultimate
moment, the older woman (the Marschallin) elegantly gives up her
young lover (Octavian) upon glimpsing him newly in love with
someone his own age (Sophie). Love is simultaneously embraced and
selflessly surrendered in a song that has the melodic depths and
passion of Wagner but the libretto and spirit of Mozart. The clock
has run out on the Marschallin's romantic life. She has had her
chance, her time, and now she must bow out _ how suited to the
close of this last thousand years.

<P>
   The sex scandal of the millennium didn't involve Clintons or
Windsors, although it did involve an English king. This one changed
the laws of God and man, created a saint and destroyed a courtier
of Machiavellian brilliance. It was Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. How
could such a passion ever die? Perhaps, as has been said, ``only
the little loves last.''

   &UR; TRUE LOVE MAY LAST FOREVER, BUT IT HASN'T BEEN AROUND THAT LONG
 &UR; (1,100 words)
 &UR; By JOYCE CAROL OATES
</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world has come to mean, in the popular
imagination, romantic love almost exclusively. But it may come as a
surprise to learn that the very concept of ``love'' based on
emotion as a high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is
relatively new in the history of mankind. In the ancient world,
romantic love would seem to have been virtually unknown, and rarely
celebrated. Our generic term ``love'' didn't exist. The sentiment
of romantic love as we know it was the homoerotic love of older
Greek men for boys. Marital love, which surely existed, seems oddly
not to have been much honored, at least in surviving literature.

   &UR; HELOISE, THE MILLENNIUM'S ULTIMATE LOVER
 &UR; (500 words)
 &UR; By JEFFREY EUGENIDES
</P>
<P>
   Why does Heloise, a reluctant, heartbroken nun, stand out among
the millennium's romantic figures? Not simply because of her
shameless intelligence, which won her the right to be treated as a
thinking self at a time when most women were not. Nor because of
her gifts as a classical logician. It is because of her lifelong
refusal to condemn or forget the pleasures of a passion that ruined
her life.

   &UR; THE BEST LOVESONG OF THE MILLENNIUM
 &UR; (750 words)
 &UR; By LORRIE MOORE
</P>
<P>
   Richard Strauss knew that love triangles make the best music,
and proved it in ``Der Rosenkavalier.'' At the opera's penultimate
moment, the older woman (the Marschallin) elegantly gives up her
young lover (Octavian) upon glimpsing him newly in love with
someone his own age (Sophie). Love is simultaneously embraced and
selflessly surrendered in a song that has the melodic depths and
passion of Wagner but the libretto and spirit of Mozart. The clock
has run out on the Marschallin's romantic life. She has had her
chance, her time, and now she must bow out _ how suited to the
close of this last thousand years.

 a return to comfort and nostalgia  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 HIGH POINT, N.C. _  Something looks familiar about the season's new
home furnishings. It's the '40s line of a chair arm, '60s
light-wood finishes, '70s deep upholstery _ the touches we came
home to, but abandoned, over the decades.
 &HT;    In fact, the fall International Home Furnishings Market, an
eight-day industry bazaar closing Friday in High Point, N.C., nods
to the past, but with distinctively year 2000 visual lines,
proportions and materials.
 &HT;    Futurist Faith Popcorn, in High Point to unveil her collection,
``Faith Popcorn's Home Office Cocoon,'' says furniture design
reflects consumers' desire to burrow deeper into their homes, away
from a chaotic world.
 &HT;    ``As people go into 2000, they are looking for comfort,''
Popcorn said.
 &HT;    Last year, Popcorn advised the furniture industry to step beyond
providing physical comfort _ to listen harder to customers about
making furniture easier to live with. And the industry did.
 &HT;    Consumer-driven features abound at the market, including
multiple-use furniture pieces and easy-care finishes. Pure physical
comfort is there, too, in frames that hug, upholstery that softly
caresses, colors that soothe.
 &HT;    In fact, some furniture makers introduced only new fabrics and
colors, not new pieces. ``You can transform a piece just by
changing the finish and color,'' designer John Mascheroni said as
he wound among suedes and tapestries in the Swaim showroom.
 &HT;    Nearly 2,500 exhibitors attend the market in High Point,
bringing with them enough home furnishings to fill Chicago's Sears
Tower twice. It's open only to industry professionals and
journalists.
 &HT;    We'll give you a peek at some of the furnishings you'll start
seeing in showrooms by the new year.
 &HT;     The Consumer Speaks 
 &HT;    Popcorn's home office collection for Hooker Furniture includes
all the accoutrements _ computer armoires, mobile files, credenzas,
bookcases and writing desks. But it steps beyond in details that
were developed after interviews with 4,000 women who work at home.
 &HT;    ``My favorite part is the built-in bud vase in the desk,'' she
said. In addition, the desktop is slightly higher than usual,
``because a woman, when she works, crosses her legs,'' and one
drawer includes velvet-lined jewelry compartments because, ``when
she works, she takes off her earrings.''
 &HT;    A baker's rack-style computer shelf accommodates small spaces,
and smaller-scale chairs fit women's smaller frames.
 &HT;    ``I want women to call me, because I want to know what else they
want,'' Popcorn said. ``We have one secret compartment (in the
desk), but is it secret enough? Would they like a little hot button
under the desk that's hooked up to a home alarm? If they have kids,
would they like a child's desk that swings out beside their own
desk?''
 &HT;    At Lexington Home Furnishings, consumer input played into the
design of `California Legacy,' a 55-piece collection blending
Spanish, Mediterranean and English influences. The scale is
generally large to help fill new homes.
 &HT;    Lexington is building a 50-member consumer board to offer ideas
and feedback.
 &HT;    ``It's so logical, you don't have to sell people on it,''
executive vice president Robert S. Stec said. ``Until now, the
process of buying furniture has been very intimidating. People
think there's a secret society on this side of the fence.''
 &HT;     British Accents 
 &HT;    Lexington also introduced ``Bob Timberlake Riverwood,'' a
collection of English and Irish cottage designs finished in natural
antique spruce or white crackled glaze with light distressing. The
scale is generally for a spacious cottage. Timberlake, a North
Carolina artist encouraged by Andrew Wyeth, has designed furniture
for Lexington since 1990.
 &HT;    At Vanguard Furniture Co., supermodel Kathy Ireland asked
Britain's Prince Edward for advice while developing the ``Kathy
Ireland Home Collection.'' The prince flew to California to meet
with her and her designers about the colors, woods and styles used
in Windsor Castle.
 &HT;    The result is smaller-scale furniture Ireland describes as
family friendly, with features such as easy-to-open toy drawers in
dressers and coloring-book storage in coffee tables. While the
collection pays homage to her English-born father, it also reflects
her upbringing in Santa Barbara, with light finishes, rattan and
iron accents.
 &HT;    ``You can't have an appreciation for things that are new without
the proper respect for things of the past,'' she said.
 &HT;    The Forbes Collection, launched at the market, is all about
respecting things past. The elegant collection is based on
furnishings in the Forbes family's Chateau de Balleroy in Normandy,
France, and Old Battersea House in London.
 &HT;    Seven companies are licensed to produce the items: Harden
Furniture; Chelsea House Inc. (pillows and lighting); Couristan
Inc. (rugs); Austin Horn Collection (bedding); O'Brien Ironworks
(outdoor furniture); Paragon Picture Gallery (framed prints); and
Interior Indulgences Inc. (candles and accessories).
 &HT;    There's one concession to Malcolm Forbes' rebellious side: a
sofa with tall turned legs and black leather upholstery, reflecting
his passion for motorcycles.
 &HT;    While the name of the ``British Open Collection'' might evoke
images of golf, Century Furniture had in mind the casual elegance
of the Royal &AMP; cq  Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews when designing
it. Examples: the 60-inch round, eight-legged ``Turnberry''
cocktail table with maple veneer top and the three-shelf ``Colfax''
chairside table, evoking an antique English library table.
 &HT;     Make Mine Modern 
 &HT;    The clean lines and curves of Art Deco get a rebirth in
Bernhardt Furniture Co.'s ``Manhattan.'' A bowed-front buffet
features beaded, shaped feet with a green granite top; a master
chest with horizontal scooping on the door fronts offers
up-to-the-century hardware finished in brushed nickel.
 &HT;    Not quite modern enough? Take a look at Milo Baughman's
``Limited Edition'' day chaise, for Thayer Coggin Inc. The dramatic
white chaise features a curving, chrome-outlined underside.
 &HT;    ``My objective was to give my `Limited Edition' collection the
glamour and comfort of the late '30s and '40s moderne, but not in a
retro fashion,'' Baughman said. ``I hoped to achieve a synthesis
that would reflect the truly innovative spirit that I expect will
come in the new century.''
 &HT;     Outdoors Chic 
 &HT;    Outdoor furniture you could use indoors: That's how several
companies describe their new offerings.
 &HT;    Larry Laslo's ``Lyre Lyre'' pieces for Veneman Collections
feature lyre backs in aluminum and footed legs. It's based on a
garden chair he found at a Sotheby's auction in New York.
 &HT;    His ``La Couer,'' also for Veneman, offers wide seats and a back
pattern of entwined hearts found in a French bistro set from the
'40s. Designers in the '40s were looking back to the more
substantial shapes of the 18th century.
 &HT;    Brown Jordan's new releases actually are intended for indoors or
outdoors. Tubular vinyl plays the supporting role in
``Streamline,'' wrapped around a gently curving, brushed metal
frame. ``Fusion,'' of blond-colored resin strips woven tightly over
an aluminum frame, evokes the blond furniture finishes of the '40s
and '50s.
 &HT;    For a collection so new it barely made it to High Point, San
Francisco designer Michael Vanderbyl of McGuire Furniture looked to
Shaker designs, midcentury modernism and his own sailboat. The
result, ``Archetype by McGuire,'' combines aluminum frames with
teak grids and nylon webbing for 14 easy-going pieces.
 &HT;     Upscale Animals 
 &HT;    Animal motifs turn up all over the market, mostly in fabrics.
Leopard remains strong, but zebra and pony prints are catching up.
 &HT;    Swaim and Pennsylvania House are showing new upholstery
collections including a monkey motif.
 &HT;    But animals sneak into furniture in other ways, too. At Palecek,
based in Richmond, natural, brown and black wicker creates the
stripes on the ``Zebra'' chair.
 &HT;    Garcia Imports in Hayward is showing its ``Safari'' carved-wood
bench with hand-painted zebra side panels and a black muslin seat.
 &HT;     Really Retro 
 &HT;    Perhaps the most retrospective piece at the High Point market is
actually an intact oldie: the original La-Z-Boy recliner. Each
limited-edition reproduction La-Z-Boy comes with a certificate of
authorization, but it looks nothing like its upholstered progeny.
 &HT;    This recliner was a lawn chair made of wood slats in 1928 in
Monroe, Mich. Its popularity grew _ and grew _ until today, through
mergers and acquisitions, La-Z-Boy is the nation's biggest
furniture company.
 &HT;    What a long way La-Z-Boy _ and the 90-year-old High Point home
furnishings market _ have come.
 &HT;     
 
 
BEGIN OPTIONAL SIDEBARS: 
 
HOME FURNISHINGS TRENDS AT A GLANCE &HT;      
 Multiple uses.  Look for more coffee tables with drawers for kids'
crayons and coloring books, and drop leaves for extra entertaining
space; also, more sectional sofas to form seating arrangements
convenient for the moment.
 &HT;     Red.  It will be the next hot color, from stop-sign to burgundy
shades.
 &HT;     Metal on wood.  Metal tops headboards, holds up tabletops, puts
a gleam on corners. Go for the silver. Better yet, make it pewter.
And don't forget silver-leaf-on-wood accents for bedroom and living
room.
 &HT;     Expanded world influences.  The world of furniture is moving
beyond China, Australia and France to Africa, India and South
America, especially in hardware, upholstery and decorative
accessories. The English estate look crops up in entire
collections.
 &HT;     Animal influence.  The leopard look maintains its hold on lamp
shades and throw pillows, but zebra and pony patterns come on
strong in upholstery, area rugs and even in rattan weaves _ all
reflecting women's fashion trends. Ultra hot: monkey motifs.
 &HT;     Pastel leathers.  Think pink, peach, mint and butter.
 &HT;     Shimmering fabrics.  We'll see throw pillows and bedspreads
that sparkle subtly, a mother lode of gold and silver satin sheets,
and upholstery with a hint of sheen.
 &HT;     Instant age.  Expect painted finishes with corners and edges
worn to the wood; crackled color glazes; rustlike patinas on metal.
 &HT;     Easy-care surfaces.  Satin finishes, less likely to show
fingerprints, are the last word for wood. On top, several companies
are using Corian for tables and kitchen islands.
 &HT;     
 
 Big Names in the Furniture Biz

 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; HIGH POINT, N.C. _  &LR; You, too, could own a leather couch like the
one Jack Palance sat on last week at the International Home
Furnishings Market, drawing dozens of people to see the spectacle.
<P>
   Palance was one of several celebrities who visited High Point to
drum up business _ furniture business. Their names mean cash and
cachet for furniture makers _ names like Alexander Julian,
Christopher Forbes, Kathy Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a celebrity,'' supermodel Ireland said Friday as she
unveiled the Kathy Ireland Collection for Vanguard Furniture. Her
bodyguard stood nearby, and her limo waited outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a working mom. I've worked hard over the years on the
quality of my brand.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Indeed, as crows' feet crept onto her face, Ireland turned &LR; 
from modeling  &LR;  to design and marketing. &LR;  She keeps in touch with
consumers through her Web site,  &LR; www.kathyireland.com &LR; , she says,
and hopes to gather their feedback about her English-inspired
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing designer Alexander Julian drew inspiration closer to
home for his ``Colourscapes,'' accent chairs and five new
upholstery groups made by BenchCraft. His new fabrics reflect U.S.
landscapes in typically soft-hued Julian fashion, including
blue-and-purple-tinged ``Misty Vineyards of Napa.''
</P>
<P>
   Folk artist Warren Kimble, known for his American primitive
style, told a private luncheon about his 30-year rise from a
blue-collar Vermont home to a licensing bonanza that includes
miniature furniture, hooked rugs and flags introduced at High
Point.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Christopher Forbes. The son of media magnate Malcolm held
his photo op just a little too far from the furniture-market action
to attract many foot-weary walkers. The launch of a
Faberge-egg-shaped balloon at the edge of downtown High Point
officially unveiled a 30-piece art-and-furnishings collection
inspired by his family's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Action Lane showroom (a division of Lane furniture),
actor Palance moseyed onto a Western set featuring a brown sofa
with tack trim. Wearing a chambray shirt, red bandanna, jeans and
dust-free brown boots and chaps, he looked a bit confused about his
role as a sofa spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But his part soon became clear as he accepted a furniture
industry award for best television commercial of 1999, for a
national advertising campaign to be rolled out in November. As a
photographer set up a camera for all those who wanted their
pictures taken with the leather-faced star, Palance whipped out a
pen to sign autographs for adoring furniture buyers and sales
representatives.

 &HT;       
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; HIGH POINT, N.C. _  &LR; Furniture stores call them ``dot commies,''
fearing they'll destroy retailing as we know it. But online
furniture sites, still in their infancy, captivate consumers _ and
the industry is preparing for the inevitable.
<P>
   How-to workshops and seminars about online selling and services
dot the agenda for the International Home Furnishings Market, which
ends Friday in High Point.
</P>
<P>
   For furniture customers, online sites offer a variety of
services, including complete home decor planning, links to
manufacturers' Web sites and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our case, consumers are using the channel to get
information,'' says Steve Antisdel, president of FurnitureFind.com,
based in Niles, Mich. FurnitureFind.com provides product
information and sells online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our buyers are the working soccer mom who's found a way to
extend her day with this; the distance-confined, who live too far
from a store to shop; and retail refugees who've been pounced on or
ignored by furniture salespeople,'' Antisdel adds.
</P>
<P>
   Customers seem poised for online furniture shopping; San
Francisco-based Jupiter Communications, a market-research firm,
projects online sales in home-related categories to leap to $3.6
billion in 2003 from $100 million in 1998. Granted, that's a blip
in the $250 billion home-design industry.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Making the Leap Online
</P>
<P>
   Jay Busey is a skeptic-turned-optimist when it comes to Internet
furniture sales.
</P>
<P>
   When Busey's 27-year-old son, Andrew, an Internet pioneer, asked
whether they could sell online together, ``I said, `No way. You
have to touch furniture, feel it, smell it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Busey gauged the reactions of ordinary people to the idea,
and in July, the father-son duo took Shaw Furniture Galleries, a
living.com company, to the Internet at  &LR; www.shawgalleries.com &LR; . It
ships via specialty carrier anywhere in the continental United
States and is building a call center and warehouse in Greensboro,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Busey says he needs to offer exceptionally high quality and
customer service to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to provide the `wow!' factor,'' Busey says.
``When the customer opens it up, it had better be better than they
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics within the industry point out the impersonal nature of
e-commerce customer service and the possibility that online sellers
will undercut the prices of neighborhood furniture retailers,
driving them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Both Busey and Antisdel stressed the need for e-tailers to offer
customers reliable advice and to handle their complaints quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is like a very big small town,'' Antisdel says.
``Word gets out quickly, so you have to take care of the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows price is not the driving issue for our
customers,'' he adds. ``It's convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   To mollify angry retailers, one online company, San
Francisco-based GoodHome.com, plans eventually to sell only
furniture bearing its own label, chief executive officer Douglas
Mack says.
</P>
<P>
   How easy can shopping get?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site is organized around making it easy for consumers to
find products,'' says Linda Lewi of homeportfolio.com, based in
Newton, Mass. ``Consumers can archive pictures of products or
e-mail them to a friend or relative. They can get a referral to a
retailer for any product.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, homeportfolio.com is expected to display
more than 100,000 products from 750 manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several manufacturers recently moved online or said
they will do so.
</P>
<P>
   S.E.E. Imports of Hayward announced in High Point that it has
created a site,  &LR; www.seeimports.com &LR; , to show consumers its line
and tell them which retailers carry it.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  LifeStyle Furnishings International launched sites for its
divisions, including BenchCraft, Henredon, Lexington and Drexel
Heritage.
</P>

   &UR; `HAMLET' IS THE BEST `POEM' OF THE MILLENIUM
 &UR; (700 words)
 &UR; By HELEN VENDLER
</P>
<P>
   It is no betrayal of the form to proclaim ``Hamlet'' the
greatest poem of the millennium. Its lyric structure gives us
Hamlet's high consciousness, tragic and mocking, arching like a
glittering spider web over the dramatic action. Hamlet is always at
the center: All the other figures in the play are there to provoke,
to repudiate, to interrupt his brilliant cascades of language.

   &UR; BYRON AND THE LOST ART OF IMMORTALITY
 &UR; (1,500 words)
 &UR; By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN
</P>
<P>
   By age 36, Lord Byron, the original bad boy of English
literature, had made a nation of repressed women swoon despite his
escapades. Notwithstanding a malformed foot, he was as famous for
his athletic prowess as for his brand of cynicism. He lacked only
one thing to insure his immortality: a really good death. And this
came about with perfect filmic melodrama in 1824. Byron and his era
gave us the cliche of the artist gladly outraging society,
asserting the primacy of his opinion and claiming absolute
indifference to public reaction. These became essential aspects of
Romanticism, and 200 years later they are still entwined in our
definition of creative genius.

</P>
<P>
   ``The Thousand and One Nights'' has everything a tale should
have. Sex, death, treachery, humor, surprise and a happy ending.
Though it appears to be a story against women, it actually marks
the creation of one of the strongest and cleverest heroines in
world literature. Scheherazade triumphs because she is endlessly
inventive. Her stories deal with love and life and death and money
and food and all the other human necessities.

   Seven major images of the millennium have shaped our

but also in the lives of all of us. They tell us what human beings
will do to other human beings. Some of it is encouraging. Some of

<P>
   Traditionally, in high art, men were the image shapers, and it's
not hard to notice that their pictures of women differ from women's
pictures of women. This is significant when we consider how deeply
our cultural reflexes, and our sexual politics, have been
influenced by images of women: woman as mother, as goddess, as muse
or sex object. Now after centuries of conforming to men's views and
stereotypes, female artists are taking control of their own images.

</P>
<P>
   The signal art work of the millennium (let's narrow it down and
stick to the West) no longer exists, and is only mentioned in a
text from the 1480s, a biography of Filippo Brunelleschi. The
Florentine architect is credited with inventing perspective, the
system for representing three dimensions in two, so that, in a
painting or drawing, a beautiful lady's string of pearls would look
closer than the map on the wall. Perspective works by having a
vanishing point, or single spot at which all parallel lines going
from near to far theoretically converge, the effect of which
creates an illusion of depth.

LIVE FINDS FOCUS ON FOURTH ALBUM, `THE DISTANCE TO HERE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ed Kowalczyk, singer of the multimillion-selling
rock quartet Live, likes to tell how he made personal politics
universal in the current radio hit ``The Dolphin's Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The song, taken from Live's fourth and latest album ``The
Distance to Here,'' opens with a restrained vocal and poetic
lyrics: ``The way you're bathed in light, reminds me of that
night/God laid me down into your rose garden of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an uplifting number that takes the listener on a
roller-coaster ride via a wall of guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Kowalczyk, who is in his mid-20s, says the song came while he
was camping in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing the chords and an hour later I had an idea
of the melody,'' he recalled. ``The lyrics came after. It starts
out in a very intimate setting. When I talk about the dolphins,
it's an invitation to a kind of dreamscape. The real guts of the
message is, life is like a shooting star, and the song builds to a
realization of a universal love, starting with two people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a standard message for Pennsylvania's Live, which rose to
success five years ago on the strength of anthemic music and
idealistic songwriting, two elements that drew frequent comparisons
to U2.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing their 1991 debut album, ``Mental Jewelry,''
Kowalczyk and company spent three years honing their second effort,
``Throwing Copper,'' the album that would spawn the crossover hits
``I Alone,'' ``Selling the Drama'' and ``Lightning Crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc made Live stars, but the self-conscious ``Secret
Samadhi'' that followed in 1997 fell flat, especially compared to
the direct arena-oriented rock of the previous effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Distance to Here'' (Radioactive), produced like other Live
albums by ex-Talking Head Jerry Harrison, is a return to what Live
does best, while the first single, ``The Dolphin's Cry,'' chalks up
spins on rock and alt-rock radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious `Dolphin's Cry' was going to be the
first single,'' Kowalczyk said. ``It has a dynamic and an emotion
that announces what we're about. The song is almost like a call to
arms not only for us but for where we're headed. It just felt like
the right song to announce the new record.''
</P>
<P>
   The new record zoomed into the charts upon release, debuting at
No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able, nor have I wanted, to separate my desire
for truth and passion from my lyrics,'' Kowalczyk said. ``I've
always been into asking the big questions. I'm always the last guy
out the door at closing time 'cause I'm sitting around till the wee
hours with the others asking the same things. That's what it's all
about for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalczyk said Harrison, who essentially discovered the band 15
years ago while they were still in high school and shepherded them
through the recording of each of the four albums, ``is an expert
producer of bands. He understands the dynamic and chemistry of four
or five guys working toward a single goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kowalczyk admits, that single goal isn't always easy to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pitfalls,'' he says. ``Anytime you have several
different visions, it's a challenge. But we've been able to keep
focused in a positive direction.'' &QL;

The Clash/``The Clash Live: From Here to Eternity'' (Epic) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What should have been one of the greatest live albums of all
time falls short due to spotty song choice and less than thrilling
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In their incendiary heyday of the late '70s and early '80s, the
Clash inspired on many levels. In concert, issuing powerful songs
that mixed punk, reggae and rockabilly with politically charged
us-against-them ferver, the quartet could change lives.
</P>
<P>
   This 17-track collection _ the only authorized Clash live album
_ delivers the goods about half the time, specifically on knockout
readings of ``London's Burning,'' ``City of the Dead,'' ``Clash
City Rockers,'' ``Career Opportunities,'' ``(White Man) In
Hammersmith Palais,'' ``London Calling'' and ``Armagideon Time.''
Sadly, ``Complete Control'' which opens the disc _ with its
dub-reggae elements, the song is perhaps the most remarkable Clash
anthem _ lacks the dynamics of other versions readily available on
bootleg.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, we could have done without such mediocrities as
``Know Your Rights,'' ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``Straight to
Hell'' and the obnoxious ``Should I Stay or Should I Go.'' Yet, the
good moments on the absurdly titled ``From Here to Eternity'' (in
stores Tuesday) far outshine the dross. 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Live/``The Distance to Here'' (Radioactive) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year hiatus, Pennsylvania's Live return to the
dynamic tension that sparked the U2-inspired 1994 hits ``Selling
the Drama'' and ``Lightning Crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisely bypassing the fuzzy focus of 1997's ``Secret Samadhi,''
singer-lyricist Ed Kowalczyk nails some marvelously accessible pop
hooks, although there's nothing silly in the slightest about such
well-written material as the glorious radio smash ``The Dolphin's
Cry'' or the equally satisfying ``Sun.'' 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tom Rush/``The Very Best of Tom Rush: No Regrets 1962-99'' (Sony
Legacy) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Singer and sometime songwriter Rush worked the Cambridge folk
scene of the early '60s, carving a niche as an eclectic interpreter
of songs. On his 1968 concept album, ``The Circle Game'' (cover art
by Paul McCartney's future wife Linda Eastman), he covered Joni
Mitchell, James Taylor and Jackson Browne before any of them were
well known.
</P>
<P>
   With his rich, deep voice, Rush could take a delicate melody
like Mitchell's ``Urge for Going,'' or Bukka White's Delta blues
``Panama Limited'' _ both included here _ and make them his own.
</P>
<P>
   Rush never stopped uncovering great songs and there are plenty
on ``No Regrets,'' notably David Wiffen's ``Driving Wheel,'' Murray
McLaughlin's poignant ``Child's Song,'' and Eric Kaz's prescient
ecology ballad ``Mother Earth.'' Rush appears Nov. 20 at McCabe's.
4 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rob Lowman &QR; 
 &QL; 
Tony Bennett/``Bennett Sings Ellington: Hot &AMP; Cool'' (Columbia) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This decade, Bennett has tipped his hat to Sinatra, Fred Astaire
and Billie Holiday with terrific tribute albums, but ``Hot &AMP; Cool''
takes his artistry one step further. Collaborating as usual with
Ralph Sharon and his quartet (including the splendid drummer
Clayton Cameron), Bennett takes a fresh look at the Ellington
catalog with a delightful mixture of ballads and up-tempo tunes.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Bennett's voice isn't as powerful as it was, but
he remains a commanding presence, a singer able to summon a song's
mood and emotion with warmth and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett shares the spotlight, too: Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis
contributes a beautiful solo rendering of ``Chelsea Bridge,'' and
Joel Smirnoff, the Juilliard String Quartet's first violinist,
shines on ``Sophisticated Lady'' and ``Prelude to a Kiss.'' A
wonderful album. 3 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Melissa Etheridge/``Breakdown'' (Island) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently energized by developments in her personal life (she's
a mother of two), Etheridge returns to such familiar topics as
love, loss and confusion with the clarity her fans expect.
</P>
<P>
   While the adventurous ``Breakdown'' shows the mark of
distinctive players, including fretless bassist Pino Palladino,
Wallflowers keyboardist Rami Jaffee and powerhouse drummer Kenny
Aronoff, Etheridge maintains her rootsy appeal on tuneful,
straight-ahead items like ``Angels Would Fall.'' Another highlight:
``Scarecrow,'' a heartfelt ode to a gay murder victim. 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
311/``Soundsystem'' (Capricorn) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The five-member 311 _ currently getting airplay with this
album's dance hall-styled ``Come Original'' _ has been pounding the
now familiar rap-metal-funk turf for eight years while stirring in
such elements as reggae and dub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soundsystem,'' the Los Angeles band's sixth album, goes for
the throat with a raw, full-throttle sound that will appeal to the
teen-age fans of chart-toppers Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit. 2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Bruce Cockburn/``Breakfast in New Orleans Dinner in Timbuktu''
(Rykodisc) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   We confess a long-running weakness for Cockburn's intelligent
folk-pop, with its environmental and human-rights concerns,
Christian faith, array of musical cultures and sweet romance.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness has only been reaffirmed by ``Breakfast,'' a
pleasing addition to Cockburn's three-decade career. Although we
can't figure why he's doing a bluesy ``Blueberry Hill'' with Cowboy
Junkies' Margo Timmins (who, like Lucinda Williams, appears on
three tracks), we like it just the same. Smart, lovely stuff from
Canada's most reliable export after Molson's lager. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QR; 
 &QL; 
George Winston/``Plains'' (Windham Hill) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Winston made it through the seasons with a popular
series of thematic albums, and ``Plains'' arrives as his second
landscape-oriented effort. Having spent much of his youth in
eastern Montana on the edge of the Great Plains, Winston has a
clear affinity for the feel and mood of his subject.
</P>
<P>
   Veering between spare, contemplative songs and folksy Americana,
the results here shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with his
previous work.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are covers of contemporary tunes like Sarah
McLachlan's ``Angel'' and ``The Dance,'' the Tony Arata ballad
Garth Brooks made his signature song. The disc ends with Winston
indulging his passion for Hawaiian slack-key guitar on two tunes.
``Plains'' is plainly another winner. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Solar Twins/``Solar Twins'' (Maverick) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sleek sounds from a pair of Brit electronica buffs who recall
last year's radio-friendly Olive. An unlikely cover of the Clash's
``Rock the Casbah'' works against the odds, and it's not even the
most notable track here. 3 stars

`BLAIR WITCH' IS OUT THERE ... ON VIDEO AND DVD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Which old witch is the witch of the season? Why
``The Blair Witch Project,'' of course, which comes out Friday on
video and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the story before, of course. Three college kids get
lost in the Maryland woods while filming a documentary about the
mysterious and gruesome legend of the Blair Witch and are never
seen again. The only evidence of their misadventure is the film and
videos that are found. On the film, we see their harrowing
experiences, which they shoot despite their fear.
</P>
<P>
   And you've heard the other story, of course. A couple of young
filmmmakers from Florida outsmart the Hollywood system by creating
a sensation with a low-tech movie costing anywhere from $35,000 to
$50,000 that has grossed about $140 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   It did benefit from a $15 million advertising budget, but ``The
Blair Witch Project'' had an early positive buzz from screenings at
such film festivals as Sundance, and there was all kinds of
Internet speculation about whether the footage was real. (It
wasn't).
</P>
<P>
   The real genius of the film was to do something that Hollywood
seems to have forgotten how to do (except for ``The Sixth Sense''):
create atmospheric terror. In one of the best films ever made about
Hollywood, Vincent Minnelli's ``The Bad and the Beautiful,'' a
producer (Jonathan Shields) played by Kirk Douglas has been told by
the studio to make a film called ``The Cat Men'' using guys dressed
up in bad cat suits. Realizing that actually showing the suit will
undercut the fright factor, Shields asks the question: What are we
afraid of? The answer, naturally, is the dark. So he instructs his
director to only shoot shadows in the night. The film is a success.
Well, this is a Hollywood movie. But the lesson that you don't have
to bludgeon your audience with gore to be frightening _ which
dozens of real directors like Hitchcock knew _ seems to have been
lost ... until now.
</P>
<P>
   The second stroke of genius by the ``Blair Witch'' filmmakers
was to have the characters' increasingly disoriented and frightened
state reflected in the way the movie was shot. At the beginning of
the film, the three characters _ who are played by actors using
their real names: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua
Leonard _ are happy and playful. The trip is just a lark. The
camerawork, though amateurish, is assured. As the trio find
themselves lost and start hearing sounds in the night, as well as
finding indications that something is around them, the camerawork
grows bizarre and crooked. As smart as this move is, it can't be
duplicated without seeming trite. So beware of any imitations
Hollywood may have planned.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, the film more or less acts as a metaphor for
life on the edge of the millennium. But, hey, this is a video
column so we'll skip that.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the actors used their real names helped to fuel
speculation and maintain the illusion that the story was real, and
an interest in all things ``Blair Witch'' grew.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD and video versions offer extras for the fans ofthe
film. Both include the Sci-Fi Channel special, ``The Curse of the
Blair Witch,'' a fake documentary that interviews ``experts'' on
the Blair Witch. The DVD also includes interviews with the actors
and filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And since the buzz on the Internet was so important to the
initial success of the film, if you have a DVD-ROM in your
computer, there is a map of the Black Hills Forest, a dossier and
access to the various Blair Witch Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting things about watching ``The Blair Witch
Project'' at home is that it looks like a home movie _ only a scary
one. &QL;

LAURIE ANDERSON TAKES THE ROAD TO MELVILLE

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick,'' her
dreamy, impressionistic homage to Herman Melville's classic novel,
Laurie Anderson talks quietly but carries a big harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a customized, microprocessor-filled aluminum
tube, known as the Talking Stick, which Anderson skillfully uses to
conjure a vast oceanscape of eerie sounds and haunting musical
associations.
</P>
<P>
   During her 90-minute performance at UCLA's Royce Hall, Anderson
weaves an electronic tapestry of tolling bells, the underwater
clicking of whales, snatches of Celtic melody, a doleful church
organ (when the Pequod meets its untimely fate), Afro-Caribbean
polyrhythms and what sound like abstracted, angularized versions of
Middle Eastern and Polynesian strings.
</P>
<P>
   It's an inspired aural collage based on Melville's dense book,
which tracks a whaling crew's spiritual odyssey from the craggy
certainties of New England Calvinism to bloody disaster somewhere
off Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick,'' which is playing through
Saturday, brings out the best in Anderson's sing-songy,
free-associating method of storytelling. Like an old salt with an
entertaining but unwieldy yarn to spin, she knows how to pick her
details carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson rarely scores a direct emotional bull's-eye with this
material, but that's partly because she's too savvy an artist to
try to nail down Melville's slippery text. Just as ``Moby Dick''
itself is less a traditional narrative than a whirling vortex of
philosophical conjecture and poetic digression, so is Anderson's
tribute an eccentric, highly personal reading of Melville _ an
interpolation of an interpolation.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into 30 vignettes of varying lengths, the piece uses
four live actors _ a first in Anderson's work _ plus a bass player,
Iceland's Skuli Sverrisson, whose funky, allusive fretwork
complements Anderson's more ethereal violin and keyboard
ruminations. Video projections of surging waves, whale-shaped
constellations and ghostly polar ice caps, along with witty cartoon
graphics and somewhat crude animation, lend imagistic substance to
an evening that otherwise might founder in too much Melvillian
metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographed by avant-garde favorite Anne Bogart (credited with
``staging co-direction''), the piece may remind you visually of
Robert Wilson's postmodern operas. Silhouetted sailors cross the
multilevel stage in stately procession. A crewman waxes
philosophical from a movable crow's nest.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most effective episodes are the evocation of Pip, the
cabin boy, taking a tumble overboard into the heart of God's
mechanical creation. The piece takes an even creepier turn when the
madness of Capt. Ahab is portrayed by actor Tom Nelis, his
magnified, split-screen face looming behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Nelis' apoplectic Ahab casts off his crutches and does
a bizarre comic two-step _ a reference to ``Moby Dick's'' severe
case of mind-body splits. The closer you are to having read or
reread Melville's book, the more you'll likely glean from
Anderson's rich and strange responses to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick'' makes Melville's 1851
masterpiece feel freshly mysterious and vital, like some exotic
pearl just dredged from the ocean depths. There is considerable
passion and perception in this postmodern salute to a premodern
masterwork _ and more than a drop of brilliance. &QL;

Dick.'' &QL;

STUDY SAYS HOT CALIFORNIA PROPERTY MARKET MAY TAKE BREATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Home sales in California will moderate to a more
sustainable level in 2000 after setting records this year, the
California Association of Realtors said. Meanwhile, the state's
median home price is expected to rise by 5 percent to $228,400 in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, median home prices have risen 8 percent this year,
the association reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California housing market is having its best year on
record, while the economic expansion in the state has not only
continued but has actually accelerated,'' said Diana Bull,
president of the association. ``Home prices in many regions of the
state are exceeding the peak levels of the previous housing cycle
set in the late 1980s or early 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 653,390 existing, single-family home sales are
projected for this year in California, up 4 percent from 628,260 in
1998, the association said. The group expects sales to decline 8
percent to 601,120 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth in the United States will moderate in 2000, in
part because of Federal Reserve policies to raise interest rates,''
said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president and chief economist of
the realty association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trend also could be amplified by continued volatility in
the stock market,'' she said. ``Since American consumption is
somewhat leveraged right now to the stock market, a prolonged drop
in equity values could result in a significant slowing of the U.S.
and California economies.''
</P>
<P>
   John McInerney, managing broker of the TRI/Coldwell Banker
office in San Francisco, had another view entirely: ``If you are
living in an average place, the average means something to you,''
McInerney said of the statewide averages. His office is the largest
real estate office in San Francisco, with 100 agents.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney anticipates no hesitation in business despite the rise
in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statewide numbers are laughable when you put them in the
context of what is going on here,'' McInerney said of the San
Francisco area. ``I think this is the economic center of the
universe right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Association of Realtors also made these
predictions for 2000:
</P>
<P>
   _ There will be a 2.8 percent expansion in the nation's gross
domestic product, following a projected 3.6 percent GDP growth rate
this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fixed mortgage interest rates are expected to average 7.8
percent, up slightly from the 7.4 percent average projected for all
of 1999. Adjustable mortgage interest rates are expected to rise
slightly from 5.8 percent in 1999 to 6 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ New housing permits are expected to reach 170,500 next year in
California, up 10 percent from a projected 155,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based California Association of Realtors has
95,000 members.

<P>
   LONDON _ Gary Ezzo, a 50-something evangelical Christian
minister, is a parenting guru dear to the hearts of more than a
million parents around the world. But he also strikes fear in the
hearts of pediatricians and child-care specialists.
</P>
<P>
   By recommending, among other things that children as young as 18
months be spanked, Ezzo has become one of the most controversial
parenting experts in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message, however, that has resonated with parents
increasingly frustrated by the permissiveness they believe is
promoted by mainstream child-care experts _ and with the
out-of-control children they see as the result.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzo's success over the last few years has brought widespread
attention to his huge, for-profit ``parenting ministry,'' Growing
Families International, based in Simi Valley, Calif. And his many
child-care guides, including ``On Becoming Babywise,'' have
consistently placed in the top 10 most requested parenting titles
on both mainstream and Christian booksellers' lists.
</P>
<P>
   This week(CQ), however, Ezzo will face a firestorm of
controversy when he and his wife, Anne Marie, come here to give a
series of lectures to thousands of British parents looking to raise
model offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is home to psychologist Penelope Leach, another
well-known parenting expert who has achieved Dr. Spock-like
popularity with millions of parents worldwide since the 1970s. She
has written several parenting guides over the years, including
``Your Baby and Child,'' which was first published in 1977 and has
since been translated into 29 languages.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps no two parenting experts are more polarized on
nearly every point of child-rearing than Gary Ezzo and Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Leach is famous for her ``child-centered'' approach that abhors
spanking, and advises parents to feed babies on demand or risk of
dehydration, inadequate development, and other complications. She
recommends praising children when they do right rather than
punishing them when they do wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The debate of nurturing styles, and in particular discipline
techniques, is nothing new, but seldom have the attacks been so
fervid or so personal.
</P>
<P>
   Leach calls Ezzo a dangerous man who promotes child abuse, and
she has urged the British government to investigate his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow pediatric pornography so we should not allow
this,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent weeks, an alliance of more than 200 health-care
and other organizations here called Children Are Unbeatable also
has condemned the Ezzo's parenting regime.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ezzo has been no less outspoken, however.
</P>
<P>
   He has blamed Leach's techniques for Britain's ``decline into
immorality.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that recent cases reported in the media of 12-year-old
girls giving birth in Britain highlight the need for a new ``moral
emphasis'' in child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most destructive influences in England has been the
child-centered parenting plan; the Penelope Leach philosophy which
has dominated for the last 20 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzo has said that feeding on demand can make infants fussy and
confused. He emphasizes an adherence to schedules, writing that
``God is the God of order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos' visit here has been organized by Christian Education
Europe Ltd., a group that supplies Biblical teaching materials _
including those designed by the Ezzos _ to evangelical and home
education projects.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thomas, a spokesman for the group, said Ezzo will address
four conferences, the largest being at Westminster Chapel in London
on Oct. 30, where up to 1,200 parents are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe families here are in need of a lot of moral
guidance, and that the Ezzos are the ones to give it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``moral guidance'' steeped in religious fundamentalism.
Before he started Growing Families International in1989, Gary Ezzo
served 10 years as an associate pastor at Grace Community Church in
Sun Valley, Calif. His wife was once a registered pediatric nurse.
They have two children and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the Ezzos claim that their child-rearing courses
have been taught in as many as 8,000 churches around the world.
These courses include their accompanying workbook, ``Growing Kids
God's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Severance, an assistant to the Ezzos, said their teachings
are about more than just how to feed and discipline children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They emphasize how to show love for your spouse and your
children, how to teach children to respect their elders, how to
make sure they grow up with integrity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gary Ezzo has never wanted to be portrayed as the poster
boy for spanking, and that he has always offered alternatives to
spanking, such as isolation and verbal correction.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on paper, the Ezzos' overall philosophy is that
``raising good children is not a matter of chance but a matter of
rightly applying God's principles in parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of spanking, however, has perhaps garnered them the
most attention in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos believe that children are born with a natural tendency
toward ``waywardness.'' They recommend swatting misbehaving babies
on the hand or thigh for wrongdoings such as putting fingers in
food. Spanking, or ``chastisement,'' can begin when the child is
about 18 months old. Parents can give up to five swats a day until
the child is three. Beyond that age, more swats are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Leach disagrees vehemently. A co-founder of the group EPOCH, an
acronym for End Physical Punishment of Children, she argues that
swatting children legitimizes the use of violence in society.
</P>
<P>
   Many other parenting experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanking is like road rage; there are always better ways to
solve discipline problems,'' said Marguerite Kelly, American author
of the book ``The Mother's Almanac.'' ``Spanking, threats and
bribes have one thing in common: they are so often escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos also teach parents to toilet train between the ages of
18 and 24 months, and that excessive cuddling will produce spoiled
children.
</P>
<P>
   For years, critics have charged that the Ezzos aren't qualified
to advise parents, and they have seen the Ezzos' views as
potentially dangerous teachings with little in the way of credible
research to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, the Ezzos' approach drew ``letters of
concern'' from approximately 100 health-care providers to the
American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the world's largest organization of
pediatricians issued a ``media alert'' in which the group
emphatically reaffirmed its stance that the best feeding schedules
for babies are the ones that babies design by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the Ezzos' approach hearkens back to the 1930s
and 1940s, when mothers were often given discredited advice, such
as to ``look at the clock, and not at the baby'' when trying to
determine feeding times.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Ezzos may find a generally receptive audience
when they arrive here next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey published last August for BBC Radio 4's Today
program, seven out of 10 parents said they believe it is acceptable
to smack their children if they misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Under current British law, a parent has the right to use
``reasonable chastisement'' but six other European countries _
Sweden, Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, and Norway _ have banned
all forms of physical punishment against children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ezzos teach parents how to raise good kids,'' Severance
said. ``Their message is really catching on with folks.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ They range from highly educated financial experts
to homemakers and day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But they share one thing in common: no matter how many reforms
are enacted, how many promises are made, they all think the Mexican
government lies, cheats and steals.
</P>
<P>
   They're Mexico's perpetual skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of virtual one-party rule in Mexico _ and many
crises and disappointments _ Mexicans often have trouble believing
the official word on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Many don't believe the official story that only one gunman
killed Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate who was
assassinated during a campaign rally in 1994. Many don't believe
the official line that the fugitive governor of Quintana Roo state
_ Mario Villanueva _ was able to escape surveillance and flee the
country just days before he was to be arrested on drug charges last
April.
</P>
<P>
   And many still don't believe that the first-ever presidential
primary election _ to be held by Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on Nov. 7 _ represents a true step
toward more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans live in a permanent state of suspicion,'' said
international economic consultant Rogelio Ramirez de la O(CQ), who
himself often doubts that political reforms here are genuine,
especially when it comes to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is the core of Mexico's national political life and,
some say, the reason why Mexicans tend to be so skeptical of their
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've swallowed the bitter pill too many times,'' said
Guadalupe Loaeza, who writes a column on politics and culture for
Mexico City's Reforma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari represented the
latest in decades of disappointments and broken promises, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas de Gortari vowed to pull Mexicans out of Third World
status in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But that ``seductive
vision'' faded after the Mexican peso crashed just after Salinas
left office, she said, plunging half of the country deeper into
poverty. Salinas' brother and some of his other PRI political
associates have been linked to drug traffickers who paid officials
huge bribes during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans were left more disillusioned than ever during the seven
decades since 1929 that the PRI has controlled Mexico's highest
political office.
</P>
<P>
   After reforms pushed by opposition parties to make elections
cleaner, the PRI finally lost its absolute majority in Mexico's
Congress two years ago. The PRI still controls a majority of
governors' seats but it has lost several important states in recent
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospects of more losses _ perhaps even the
constitutionally powerful presidency _ the PRI has tried to remake
itself into a more attractive, democratic option whose sheer
experience outstrips the opposition. Key to that image is its
upcoming primary, which represents the first time voters will be
allowed to choose the party's nominee for Mexico's July 2, 2000,
presidential election. Up to now, the president of the republic has
always picked the party's nominee in a secret selection process
nicknamed the ``dedazo,'' or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the public's jaded view of its old authoritarian
ways, the party has coined a new slogan plastered on billboards and
heard on frequent radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new PRI for the new millennium. A new PRI much closer to
you,'' is the message encouraging Mexicans to participate in the
November primary. Any Mexican with a voter credential will be
permitted to cast a ballot, not just PRI members.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems less than overwhelmed by the PRI's attempts to
show new colors, however.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month found that only 36 percent believe the PRI
primary will be ``totally honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a slight improvement over the poll we took in June.
That was only 31 percent,'' laughed Vicente Licona, director of
Mexico's Indemerc-Louis Harris polling operation, which did the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   In Indemerc-Louis Harris' June poll, taken before the primary
campaign was in full force, 50 percent of respondents thought the
party had already decided who would win the election. Fifty-four
percent thought Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, had already
made his selection in a de facto dedazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe a real democracy exists within the official
party (the PRI),'' said Antonio Reyes, a Mexico City chemical
engineer, whose views reflect that current of disbelief among
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the method they're using to choose their candidate is
the same that it's always been,'' Reyes added. ``They've just
dressed up the 'dedazo' so they can say there is more democracy.
They've got four pseudo-candidates, but we all know who is already
the one who is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually aggressive campaigning by one candidate _ Roberto
Madrazo _ has convinced people that the competition among the PRI
is real, Licona said. But most people seem to believe that
Madrazo's chief rival, Francisco Labastida, already has the
election in the bag because he appears to be the favorite choice of
President Zedillo and the PRI elite.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate in September, the four PRI contenders
displayed unusual hostility and criticism toward one another.
Madrazo attacked Labastida with unprecedented vigor, challenging
his competence. Labastida shot back by labeling Madrazo a two-faced
liar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare display of competition that was billed as a sign
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez de la O said he found himself staring at the screen,
searching for hints that the whole primary campaign was a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that Madrazo's campaign has been sincere,'' he
said. ``But the possibility of a negotiation with the government
(for a powerful position if he loses) is still one of the cards
Madrazo has to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Licona was even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The internal election of the PRI is perceived as fraudulent
and dishonest and already fixed,'' he said. ``In Mexico we've never
believed in elections. We've always thought there was fraud by the
PRI. And so now people are supposed to believe in an election run
by the PRI itself?''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico's election laws do not govern primaries, the
party will supervise the balloting on Nov. 7. Betting much of their
party's bid for more credibility on the primary, the party's
leaders have pledged to make the election as clean as possible.
Polls show Labastida and Madrazo running about even. Insiders are
predicting that about 80 percent of those who turn out to vote will
be PRI loyalists. If they are not satisfied that the results were
legitimate, there is a chance the PRI could fracture into
quarreling camps and go into next summer's election weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Martinez, an 82-year-old grandmother, says she won't be
one of those who goes to the polls on Nov. 7 or on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election (presidential) candidates promise change, and
then they end their terms with things worse off than when they
started,'' she said. ``They say their party (the PRI) has changed.
But I'm old and I see the same deception I've seen every election.
Why pretend when we already know who is going to win?''

   MOSCOW _ Imagine your computer running at least twice as fast as
it does now, maybe even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Move over Pentium. Move over Athlon. Is there an E2k chip in
your future?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But a Russian computer designer has invented a
microprocessor that he thinks could revolutionize the speed of the
world's computers, if only he had the financial backing to develop
it.
</P>
<P>
   The computer chip's architecture is radically different from
anything in production in the West. It is the brainchild of Boris
Babayan - known as the father of the Soviet supercomputer _ and his
team. They believe the microprocessor would be more powerful,
smaller, less susceptible to computer viruses and at least twice as
fast as other designs.
</P>
<P>
   The race is on. Intel is developing a new-generation chip called
Merced, believed to be akin in design to Babayan's project.
Likewise, other upstart microprocessor designers in the West are
experimenting with the next level of super-fast computers.
</P>
<P>
   Without backing, the Russian project will never get out of the
blocks. Babayan's company, Elbrus International, estimates that it
needs roughly $60 million and three years to convert its design to
a finished product for the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at work dressed in jeans and a plaid cotton shirt, the
65-year-old Babayan looks nothing like a career Soviet egghead. But
that was his function until Communism began to crack a decade ago.
From the 1950s until the 1980s, Babayan and his team helped produce
three generations of Soviet supercomputers, including the ones that
ran the missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Soviet Union began to crumble, the team began to
design a microprocessor that, in theory, would outpace anything the
West had to offer at the time. Babayan went on to found Elbrus, a
private company, and the chip design has become the E2k.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company has subcontracted to U.S. companies like
Sun Microsystems, developing software as its main source of income.
Elbrus employs 400 engineers, software writers and technicians at
three locations in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The work is steady and welcomed amid Russia's ongoing economic
crisis, Babayan says, but with E2k ``we could make history.'' He
hopes to have partners or financial backers by the end of the year,
acknowledging that if his company cannot develop the chip soon, it
will be overtaken by fast-evolving computer innovations elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The E2k may be more hype than hyperdrive, but some industry
analysts believe his microprocessor design is on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the E2k never sees the light of day, it is a
fascinating device on technical grounds, and it could be a
harbinger of things to come,'' wrote Keith Diefendorff in the
respected Microprocessor Report, a U.S.-based trade publication.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a lab on the outskirts of Moscow, technicians clad
in white coats and peering through microscopes are busy assembling
tiny, wristwatch-like computers, part of a transportation safety
system that could save lives.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the city, in a stylish office building near
the Moscow River, the man known as the father of the Soviet Union's
supercomputers, is now the proprietor of a thriving high-tech
company. Boris Babayan boasts that his microprocessor design could
make computers run at least twice as fast as anything U.S. giant
Intel Corp. is producing.
</P>
<P>
   In the troubled transition from communism to democracy, Russia
suffers profound economic and social problems of unemployment,
under-funded education and health problems like alcoholism. The
faulty economy has resulted in a brain drain to the West over the
past decade, with many of Russia's best minds taking their talents
to America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the bad news, there are plenty of smart people left
in Russia who believe that their ideas can change the world, if
only they had some venture capital and a workable economy in which
to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new challenge in Russia. You have to be active and
entrepreneurial. You can succeed, but you cannot just wait for
things to happen,'' said Nikolai Rogalev, who manages Izmaylovo
Science Park in Moscow, an American-style office cluster which
houses six small high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The park was started in part with the assistance of the
University of Texas at Austin and its IC2 Institute, which promotes
and assists science and technology commercialization in America and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to help Russia develop its high-tech potential, much of
the U.S. effort has centered on converting the Soviet Cold War
military machine to commercial enterprises. In his State of the
Union address this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for
spending $4.2 billion over the next five years to continue a
program to help Russia convert plants to civilian use, store its
nuclear materials safely and put its scientists to work.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson dedicated
a new supercomputer center in the formerly closed city of Sarov,
where Soviet scientists developed the nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The center is one of five projects planned in Russia under the
Nuclear Cities Initiative. The $30 million U.S. program is aimed at
converting Russia's 10 closed nuclear cities to peacetime work. The
computer center is expected to create 80 technology jobs in its
first year and as many as 650 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The IC2 Institute in Austin, will sponsor a workshop Oct. 29-30
in which they'll try to draw together U.S. companies and Russian
brainpower. The conference, entitled: ``Partnering With Russian
Nuclear Cities: Using the Best of Russian Computing and Software
Talent for U.S. Business,'' is co-sponsored by the U.S. Energy
Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, multinationals like
Intel and Sun Microsystems have dabbled in Russia on a modest scale
to tap its brainpower. Sun Microsystems subcontracts software
development out to the Moscow company Elbrus International, run by
Babayan.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, American technology firms looking to
invest overseas or create joint production ventures have avoided
Russia in favor of emerging ``high-tech'' countries like Israel,
India and South Africa, where the risks of economic and political
instability are less.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic uncertainty and by a bad
reputation as a place to do business, with crime and corruption
rampant. President Boris Yeltsin has been chronically ill for years
and Russia's commitment to democratic reforms has wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. businesses naturally go to where it is easier to do
business and there's a good return on investment,'' said David
Gibson, director of global programs for the IC2 Institute in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are Russians who are working hard, who are educated,
honest, and entrepreneurial and who in relatively small but
important ways are creating wealth and jobs and positive role
models for the new, emerging Russia,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Russian colleges and institutes continue to crank out Ph.Ds who
have solid schooling, if not the kind of advanced computer hardware
to tinker with that their counterparts in America and Europe enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But among the biggest problems is cultivating the idea among
Russian scientists that they can take an idea and run with it in
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, graduates were guaranteed jobs in a multitude
of scientific institutes that were heavily subsidized and
controlled. The top talent was sent to work in secretive ``closed''
cities where scientists applied themselves developing computers,
communications, weapons systems and aerospace designs in the Cold
War race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a leftover sentiment from the Soviet period _
that it is bad to be a salesman. You want to be a researcher, a
scientist, an engineer, but you don't go out and promote yourself
and your ideas,'' said Rogalev.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Ivan Servyukov, 57, was an engineer working
in the obscurity of the Soviet aerospace effort building
communications systems for the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and a group of younger colleagues are building on an
idea that he believes could make a profit in the world market, and
save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Their small company, Neurocom, operates from the Izmalovo
Science Park, near one of Moscow's most prestigious technical
colleges. There, it produces a wristwatch-like device that measures
the skin's electrical resistance. A tiny radio transmitter sends
the data to a microprocessor that in turn displays the wearer's
state of alertness.
</P>
<P>
   The contraption was designed as a safety device for pilots,
train engineers and long-haul truckers, giving them bio-feedback on
their state of awareness and _ in the case of train operators in
Russia, where the system is already in use _ shutting down the
locomotive should the instrument's measurement suggest the driver
is about to fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   At a price of US$2,000 per unit, Servyukov hopes his gadget will
become successful first in the former Soviet Union, and then
perhaps spread to Western Europe and America. The idea is a good
one, he insists. All he needs is money to market the device, and
the chance to prove that it works.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices of the computer guru, Babayan, software engineers
and technicians huddle around glowing monitors. It is the kind of
humming workplace of computers and cubicles that would be right at
home in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite successful. But the main problem is money. We are
in Russia and maybe (potential investors) are afraid of that,''
said Babayan. ``We have a saying in Russia: 'Hope dies last.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gary Ezzo, a 50-something evangelical Christian
minister, is a parenting guru dear to the hearts of more than a
million parents around the world. But he also strikes fear in the
hearts of pediatricians and child-care specialists.
</P>
<P>
   By recommending, among other things that children as young as 18
months be spanked, Ezzo has become one of the most controversial
parenting experts in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message, however, that has resonated with parents
increasingly frustrated by the permissiveness they believe is
promoted by mainstream child-care experts _ and with the
out-of-control children they see as the result.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzo's success over the last few years has brought widespread
attention to his huge, for-profit ``parenting ministry,'' Growing
Families International, based in Simi Valley, Calif. And his many
child-care guides, including ``On Becoming Babywise,'' have
consistently placed in the top 10 most requested parenting titles
on both mainstream and Christian booksellers' lists.
</P>
<P>
   This week(CQ), however, Ezzo will face a firestorm of
controversy when he and his wife, Anne Marie, come here to give a
series of lectures to thousands of British parents looking to raise
model offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is home to psychologist Penelope Leach, another
well-known parenting expert who has achieved Dr. Spock-like
popularity with millions of parents worldwide since the 1970s. She
has written several parenting guides over the years, including
``Your Baby and Child,'' which was first published in 1977 and has
since been translated into 29 languages.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps no two parenting experts are more polarized on
nearly every point of child-rearing than Gary Ezzo and Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Leach is famous for her ``child-centered'' approach that abhors
spanking, and advises parents to feed babies on demand or risk of
dehydration, inadequate development, and other complications. She
recommends praising children when they do right rather than
punishing them when they do wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The debate of nurturing styles, and in particular discipline
techniques, is nothing new, but seldom have the attacks been so
fervid or so personal.
</P>
<P>
   Leach calls Ezzo a dangerous man who promotes child abuse, and
she has urged the British government to investigate his teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow pediatric pornography so we should not allow
this,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent weeks, an alliance of more than 200 health-care
and other organizations here called Children Are Unbeatable also
has condemned the Ezzo's parenting regime.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ezzo has been no less outspoken, however.
</P>
<P>
   He has blamed Leach's techniques for Britain's ``decline into
immorality.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that recent cases reported in the media of 12-year-old
girls giving birth in Britain highlight the need for a new ``moral
emphasis'' in child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most destructive influences in England has been the
child-centered parenting plan; the Penelope Leach philosophy which
has dominated for the last 20 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzo has said that feeding on demand can make infants fussy and
confused. He emphasizes an adherence to schedules, writing that
``God is the God of order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos' visit here has been organized by Christian Education
Europe Ltd., a group that supplies Biblical teaching materials _
including those designed by the Ezzos _ to evangelical and home
education projects.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thomas, a spokesman for the group, said Ezzo will address
four conferences, the largest being at Westminster Chapel in London
on Oct. 30, where up to 1,200 parents are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe families here are in need of a lot of moral
guidance, and that the Ezzos are the ones to give it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ``moral guidance'' steeped in religious fundamentalism.
Before he started Growing Families International in1989, Gary Ezzo
served 10 years as an associate pastor at Grace Community Church in
Sun Valley, Calif. His wife was once a registered pediatric nurse.
They have two children and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the Ezzos claim that their child-rearing courses
have been taught in as many as 8,000 churches around the world.
These courses include their accompanying workbook, ``Growing Kids
God's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Severance, an assistant to the Ezzos, said their teachings
are about more than just how to feed and discipline children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They emphasize how to show love for your spouse and your
children, how to teach children to respect their elders, how to
make sure they grow up with integrity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gary Ezzo has never wanted to be portrayed as the poster
boy for spanking, and that he has always offered alternatives to
spanking, such as isolation and verbal correction.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on paper, the Ezzos' overall philosophy is that
``raising good children is not a matter of chance but a matter of
rightly applying God's principles in parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of spanking, however, has perhaps garnered them the
most attention in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos believe that children are born with a natural tendency
toward ``waywardness.'' They recommend swatting misbehaving babies
on the hand or thigh for wrongdoings such as putting fingers in
food. Spanking, or ``chastisement,'' can begin when the child is
about 18 months old. Parents can give up to five swats a day until
the child is three. Beyond that age, more swats are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Leach disagrees vehemently. A co-founder of the group EPOCH, an
acronym for End Physical Punishment of Children, she argues that
swatting children legitimizes the use of violence in society.
</P>
<P>
   Many other parenting experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanking is like road rage; there are always better ways to
solve discipline problems,'' said Marguerite Kelly, American author
of the book ``The Mother's Almanac.'' ``Spanking, threats and
bribes have one thing in common: they are so often escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos also teach parents to toilet train between the ages of
18 and 24 months, and that excessive cuddling will produce spoiled
children.
</P>
<P>
   For years, critics have charged that the Ezzos aren't qualified
to advise parents, and they have seen the Ezzos' views as
potentially dangerous teachings with little in the way of credible
research to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, the Ezzos' approach drew ``letters of
concern'' from approximately 100 health-care providers to the
American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the world's largest organization of
pediatricians issued a ``media alert'' in which the group
emphatically reaffirmed its stance that the best feeding schedules
for babies are the ones that babies design by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the Ezzos' approach hearkens back to the 1930s
and 1940s, when mothers were often given discredited advice, such
as to ``look at the clock, and not at the baby'' when trying to
determine feeding times.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Ezzos may find a generally receptive audience
when they arrive here next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey published last August for BBC Radio 4's Today
program, seven out of 10 parents said they believe it is acceptable
to smack their children if they misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Under current British law, a parent has the right to use
``reasonable chastisement'' but six other European countries _
Sweden, Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, and Norway _ have banned
all forms of physical punishment against children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ezzos teach parents how to raise good kids,'' Severance
said. ``Their message is really catching on with folks.''

 &HT;    MEXICANS' PERPETUAL DISTRUST INTRUDES ON POLITICAL CHANGES,
ELECTIONS

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ They range from highly educated financial experts
to homemakers and day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But they share one thing in common: no matter how many reforms
are enacted, how many promises are made, they all think the Mexican
government lies, cheats and steals.
</P>
<P>
   They're Mexico's perpetual skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of virtual one-party rule in Mexico _ and many
crises and disappointments _ Mexicans often have trouble believing
the official word on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Many don't believe the official story that only one gunman
killed Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate who was
assassinated during a campaign rally in 1994. Many don't believe
the official line that the fugitive governor of Quintana Roo state
_ Mario Villanueva _ was able to escape surveillance and flee the
country just days before he was to be arrested on drug charges last
April.
</P>
<P>
   And many still don't believe that the first-ever presidential
primary election _ to be held by Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on Nov. 7 _ represents a true step
toward more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans live in a permanent state of suspicion,'' said
international economic consultant Rogelio Ramirez de la O(CQ), who
himself often doubts that political reforms here are genuine,
especially when it comes to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is the core of Mexico's national political life and,
some say, the reason why Mexicans tend to be so skeptical of their
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've swallowed the bitter pill too many times,'' said
Guadalupe Loaeza, who writes a column on politics and culture for
Mexico City's Reforma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari represented the
latest in decades of disappointments and broken promises, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas de Gortari vowed to pull Mexicans out of Third World
status in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But that ``seductive
vision'' faded after the Mexican peso crashed just after Salinas
left office, she said, plunging half of the country deeper into
poverty. Salinas' brother and some of his other PRI political
associates have been linked to drug traffickers who paid officials
huge bribes during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans were left more disillusioned than ever during the seven
decades since 1929 that the PRI has controlled Mexico's highest
political office.
</P>
<P>
   After reforms pushed by opposition parties to make elections
cleaner, the PRI finally lost its absolute majority in Mexico's
Congress two years ago. The PRI still controls a majority of
governors' seats but it has lost several important states in recent
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospects of more losses _ perhaps even the
constitutionally powerful presidency _ the PRI has tried to remake
itself into a more attractive, democratic option whose sheer
experience outstrips the opposition. Key to that image is its
upcoming primary, which represents the first time voters will be
allowed to choose the party's nominee for Mexico's July 2, 2000,
presidential election. Up to now, the president of the republic has
always picked the party's nominee in a secret selection process
nicknamed the ``dedazo,'' or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the public's jaded view of its old authoritarian
ways, the party has coined a new slogan plastered on billboards and
heard on frequent radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new PRI for the new millennium. A new PRI much closer to
you,'' is the message encouraging Mexicans to participate in the
November primary. Any Mexican with a voter credential will be
permitted to cast a ballot, not just PRI members.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems less than overwhelmed by the PRI's attempts to
show new colors, however.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month found that only 36 percent believe the PRI
primary will be ``totally honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a slight improvement over the poll we took in June.
That was only 31 percent,'' laughed Vicente Licona, director of
Mexico's Indemerc-Louis Harris polling operation, which did the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   In Indemerc-Louis Harris' June poll, taken before the primary
campaign was in full force, 50 percent of respondents thought the
party had already decided who would win the election. Fifty-four
percent thought Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, had already
made his selection in a de facto dedazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe a real democracy exists within the official
party (the PRI),'' said Antonio Reyes, a Mexico City chemical
engineer, whose views reflect that current of disbelief among
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the method they're using to choose their candidate is
the same that it's always been,'' Reyes added. ``They've just
dressed up the 'dedazo' so they can say there is more democracy.
They've got four pseudo-candidates, but we all know who is already
the one who is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually aggressive campaigning by one candidate _ Roberto
Madrazo _ has convinced people that the competition among the PRI
is real, Licona said. But most people seem to believe that
Madrazo's chief rival, Francisco Labastida, already has the
election in the bag because he appears to be the favorite choice of
President Zedillo and the PRI elite.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate in September, the four PRI contenders
displayed unusual hostility and criticism toward one another.
Madrazo attacked Labastida with unprecedented vigor, challenging
his competence. Labastida shot back by labeling Madrazo a two-faced
liar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare display of competition that was billed as a sign
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez de la O said he found himself staring at the screen,
searching for hints that the whole primary campaign was a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that Madrazo's campaign has been sincere,'' he
said. ``But the possibility of a negotiation with the government
(for a powerful position if he loses) is still one of the cards
Madrazo has to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Licona was even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The internal election of the PRI is perceived as fraudulent
and dishonest and already fixed,'' he said. ``In Mexico we've never
believed in elections. We've always thought there was fraud by the
PRI. And so now people are supposed to believe in an election run
by the PRI itself?''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico's election laws do not govern primaries, the
party will supervise the balloting on Nov. 7. Betting much of their
party's bid for more credibility on the primary, the party's
leaders have pledged to make the election as clean as possible.
Polls show Labastida and Madrazo running about even. Insiders are
predicting that about 80 percent of those who turn out to vote will
be PRI loyalists. If they are not satisfied that the results were
legitimate, there is a chance the PRI could fracture into
quarreling camps and go into next summer's election weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Martinez, an 82-year-old grandmother, says she won't be
one of those who goes to the polls on Nov. 7 or on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election (presidential) candidates promise change, and
then they end their terms with things worse off than when they
started,'' she said. ``They say their party (the PRI) has changed.
But I'm old and I see the same deception I've seen every election.
Why pretend when we already know who is going to win?''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Imagine your computer running at least twice as fast as
it does now, maybe even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Move over Pentium. Move over Athlon. Is there an E2k chip in
your future?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But a Russian computer designer has invented a
microprocessor that he thinks could revolutionize the speed of the
world's computers, if only he had the financial backing to develop
it.
</P>
<P>
   The computer chip's architecture is radically different from
anything in production in the West. It is the brainchild of Boris
Babayan - known as the father of the Soviet supercomputer _ and his
team. They believe the microprocessor would be more powerful,
smaller, less susceptible to computer viruses and at least twice as
fast as other designs.
</P>
<P>
   The race is on. Intel is developing a new-generation chip called
Merced, believed to be akin in design to Babayan's project.
Likewise, other upstart microprocessor designers in the West are
experimenting with the next level of super-fast computers.
</P>
<P>
   Without backing, the Russian project will never get out of the
blocks. Babayan's company, Elbrus International, estimates that it
needs roughly $60 million and three years to convert its design to
a finished product for the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at work dressed in jeans and a plaid cotton shirt, the
65-year-old Babayan looks nothing like a career Soviet egghead. But
that was his function until Communism began to crack a decade ago.
From the 1950s until the 1980s, Babayan and his team helped produce
three generations of Soviet supercomputers, including the ones that
ran the missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Soviet Union began to crumble, the team began to
design a microprocessor that, in theory, would outpace anything the
West had to offer at the time. Babayan went on to found Elbrus, a
private company, and the chip design has become the E2k.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company has subcontracted to U.S. companies like
Sun Microsystems, developing software as its main source of income.
Elbrus employs 400 engineers, software writers and technicians at
three locations in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The work is steady and welcomed amid Russia's ongoing economic
crisis, Babayan says, but with E2k ``we could make history.'' He
hopes to have partners or financial backers by the end of the year,
acknowledging that if his company cannot develop the chip soon, it
will be overtaken by fast-evolving computer innovations elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The E2k may be more hype than hyperdrive, but some industry
analysts believe his microprocessor design is on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the E2k never sees the light of day, it is a
fascinating device on technical grounds, and it could be a
harbinger of things to come,'' wrote Keith Diefendorff in the
respected Microprocessor Report, a U.S.-based trade publication.

   MOSCOW _ In a lab on the outskirts of Moscow, technicians clad
in white coats and peering through microscopes are busy assembling
tiny, wristwatch-like computers, part of a transportation safety
system that could save lives.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the city, in a stylish office building near
the Moscow River, the man known as the father of the Soviet Union's
supercomputers, is now the proprietor of a thriving high-tech
company. Boris Babayan boasts that his microprocessor design could
make computers run at least twice as fast as anything U.S. giant
Intel Corp. is producing.
</P>
<P>
   In the troubled transition from communism to democracy, Russia
suffers profound economic and social problems of unemployment,
under-funded education and health problems like alcoholism. The
faulty economy has resulted in a brain drain to the West over the
past decade, with many of Russia's best minds taking their talents
to America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the bad news, there are plenty of smart people left
in Russia who believe that their ideas can change the world, if
only they had some venture capital and a workable economy in which
to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new challenge in Russia. You have to be active and
entrepreneurial. You can succeed, but you cannot just wait for
things to happen,'' said Nikolai Rogalev, who manages Izmaylovo
Science Park in Moscow, an American-style office cluster which
houses six small high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The park was started in part with the assistance of the
University of Texas at Austin and its IC2 Institute, which promotes
and assists science and technology commercialization in America and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to help Russia develop its high-tech potential, much of
the U.S. effort has centered on converting the Soviet Cold War
military machine to commercial enterprises. In his State of the
Union address this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton called for
spending $4.2 billion over the next five years to continue a
program to help Russia convert plants to civilian use, store its
nuclear materials safely and put its scientists to work.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson dedicated
a new supercomputer center in the formerly closed city of Sarov,
where Soviet scientists developed the nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The center is one of five projects planned in Russia under the
Nuclear Cities Initiative. The $30 million U.S. program is aimed at
converting Russia's 10 closed nuclear cities to peacetime work. The
computer center is expected to create 80 technology jobs in its
first year and as many as 650 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The IC2 Institute in Austin, will sponsor a workshop Oct. 29-30
in which they'll try to draw together U.S. companies and Russian
brainpower. The conference, entitled: ``Partnering With Russian
Nuclear Cities: Using the Best of Russian Computing and Software
Talent for U.S. Business,'' is co-sponsored by the U.S. Energy
Department's Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, multinationals like
Intel and Sun Microsystems have dabbled in Russia on a modest scale
to tap its brainpower. Sun Microsystems subcontracts software
development out to the Moscow company Elbrus International, run by
Babayan.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, American technology firms looking to
invest overseas or create joint production ventures have avoided
Russia in favor of emerging ``high-tech'' countries like Israel,
India and South Africa, where the risks of economic and political
instability are less.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been plagued by economic uncertainty and by a bad
reputation as a place to do business, with crime and corruption
rampant. President Boris Yeltsin has been chronically ill for years
and Russia's commitment to democratic reforms has wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. businesses naturally go to where it is easier to do
business and there's a good return on investment,'' said David
Gibson, director of global programs for the IC2 Institute in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are Russians who are working hard, who are educated,
honest, and entrepreneurial and who in relatively small but
important ways are creating wealth and jobs and positive role
models for the new, emerging Russia,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Russian colleges and institutes continue to crank out Ph.Ds who
have solid schooling, if not the kind of advanced computer hardware
to tinker with that their counterparts in America and Europe enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But among the biggest problems is cultivating the idea among
Russian scientists that they can take an idea and run with it in
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, graduates were guaranteed jobs in a multitude
of scientific institutes that were heavily subsidized and
controlled. The top talent was sent to work in secretive ``closed''
cities where scientists applied themselves developing computers,
communications, weapons systems and aerospace designs in the Cold
War race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a leftover sentiment from the Soviet period _
that it is bad to be a salesman. You want to be a researcher, a
scientist, an engineer, but you don't go out and promote yourself
and your ideas,'' said Rogalev.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Ivan Servyukov, 57, was an engineer working
in the obscurity of the Soviet aerospace effort building
communications systems for the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and a group of younger colleagues are building on an
idea that he believes could make a profit in the world market, and
save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Their small company, Neurocom, operates from the Izmalovo
Science Park, near one of Moscow's most prestigious technical
colleges. There, it produces a wristwatch-like device that measures
the skin's electrical resistance. A tiny radio transmitter sends
the data to a microprocessor that in turn displays the wearer's
state of alertness.
</P>
<P>
   The contraption was designed as a safety device for pilots,
train engineers and long-haul truckers, giving them bio-feedback on
their state of awareness and _ in the case of train operators in
Russia, where the system is already in use _ shutting down the
locomotive should the instrument's measurement suggest the driver
is about to fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   At a price of US$2,000 per unit, Servyukov hopes his gadget will
become successful first in the former Soviet Union, and then
perhaps spread to Western Europe and America. The idea is a good
one, he insists. All he needs is money to market the device, and
the chance to prove that it works.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices of the computer guru, Babayan, software engineers
and technicians huddle around glowing monitors. It is the kind of
humming workplace of computers and cubicles that would be right at
home in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite successful. But the main problem is money. We are
in Russia and maybe (potential investors) are afraid of that,''
said Babayan. ``We have a saying in Russia: 'Hope dies last.'''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ex-members of the Talking Heads just won't
play nice with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the longest-running and most disappointing feuds in
rock, David Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz and Jerry Harrison
just can't seem to see eye-to-eye on anything.
</P>
<P>
   As Weymouth recently revealed, any Talking Heads archival
project is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the recent 15th anniversary re-release of
``Stop Making Sense,'' Jonathan Demme's acclaimed documentary of
the Heads first shown in 1984. Using no voice-overs, no cut-aways
to the audience or backstage and no between-song patter, the film
focused on the music and had 'em dancing in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no arguing with David,'' Weymouth says about efforts
to restore the print of ``Stop Making Sense'' and the new edition
of the soundtrack, which offers seven previously unreleased tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says all things are white before dye is added,'' she said.
``There's just no arguing with a guy like that. You can't argue
from the point of view of the logical. You just can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   The bass-playing Weymouth, who still fronts the Tom Tom Club
with drummer/husband Frantz, insists it was Byrne vs. everyone else
during the ``Stop Making Sense'' restoration process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it has to be this way,'' she said. ``But I
think David feels any return to the past is a sign of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-minute digitally remixed and remastered ``Stop Making
Sense,'' originally shot at the Pantages Theatre, will be issued
Tuesday on DVD with commentary tracks from Byrne and Demme. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The JazzReach ``Get Hip!'' educational program comes to the
Colburn School for Performing Arts in downtown Los Angeles for five

   LOS ANGELES _ The ex-members of the Talking Heads just won't
play nice with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the longest-running and most disappointing feuds in
rock, David Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz and Jerry Harrison
just can't seem to see eye-to-eye on anything.
</P>
<P>
   As Weymouth recently revealed, any Talking Heads archival
project is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the recent 15th anniversary re-release of
``Stop Making Sense,'' Jonathan Demme's acclaimed documentary of
the Heads first shown in 1984. Using no voice-overs, no cut-aways
to the audience or backstage and no between-song patter, the film
focused on the music and had 'em dancing in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no arguing with David,'' Weymouth says about efforts
to restore the print of ``Stop Making Sense'' and the new edition
of the soundtrack, which offers seven previously unreleased tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says all things are white before dye is added,'' she said.
``There's just no arguing with a guy like that. You can't argue
from the point of view of the logical. You just can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   The bass-playing Weymouth, who still fronts the Tom Tom Club
with drummer/husband Frantz, insists it was Byrne vs. everyone else
during the ``Stop Making Sense'' restoration process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it has to be this way,'' she said. ``But I
think David feels any return to the past is a sign of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 88-minute digitally remixed and remastered ``Stop Making
Sense,'' originally shot at the Pantages Theatre, will be issued
Tuesday on DVD with commentary tracks from Byrne and Demme. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO SCHOOL &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The JazzReach ``Get Hip!'' educational program comes to the
Colburn School for Performing Arts in downtown Los Angeles for five
days, starting Nov. 1. During the program, musicians introduce
students to jazz history. ... Renowned flamenco guitarist Paco de
Lucia performs Nov. 6 at the Cerritos Center for the Performing
Arts. ... The California Guitar Trio, with ex-Peter Gabriel and Lou
Reed bassist Tony Levin, appears Oct. 29 at LunaPark in West
Hollywood.

``marvels'' like space flight and the World Wide Web.

AFI FEST DOES IT ALL IN HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The AFI Film Festival, one of the least
``Hollywood'' of the world's major festivals, opened Thursday _ in
Hollywood _ with the U.S. premiere of Miramax's ``The Cider House
Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Film Institute event in past years had been
scattered at theaters around Los Angeles, Santa Monica and points
in between. But in its 13th year, festival director Jon Fitzgerald
points out with pride, the festival takes place entirely in
Hollywood with screenings at some of Tinseltown's great old
palaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that has been lacking from this festival is the
community vibe,'' Fitzgerald said, adding that the Egyptian Theatre
will be the focal point with a steady stream of screenings and the
all-important hospitality suite for meeting, greeting and
deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   That suite, offering food and beverages as well as space to
relax between screenings, is open to all festivalgoers, not just
show-biz types.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important for L.A. to have a festival that's a
public event, not just an industry event like Sundance or Cannes,''
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   He has great expectations for director Lasse Halstrom's ``The
Cider House Rules,'' written by John Irving from his novel. It is
about an orphaned boy raised and mentored by the orphanage doctor
and stars Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the AFI festival opened with Italy's ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' which went on to win Oscars for best actor (Roberto
Benigni), best foreign language film and best dramatic score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hard act to follow,'' Fitzgerald said. ``But we
certainly come out with guns blazing.''
</P>
<P>
   He called ``The Cider House Rules'' the strongest movie he has
seen yet this year and said Thursday's 7:30 screening at the
Egyptian was ``way overbooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 official selections in competition, all making their U.S.
premieres, are:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``After the Rain'' (Japan), the late director Akira Kurosawa's
last screenplay, directed by Takashi Koizumi. A castle lord offends
local fencing masters when he chooses a stranger to teach him the
combat skill and art.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Ambush'' (Finland), directed by Olli Saarela. An idealistic
young lieutenant struggles to maintain his humanity in wartime
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Birdcage Inn'' (Korea), directed by Kim Ki-Duk. Set in a
Korean brothel, it centers on the changing relationship between a
call girl and the brothel owner's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cosy Dens'' (Czech Republic), directed by Jan Hrebejk. Two
men in 1960s Prague are opposed idealogically, but their children
see their future in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Emperor and the Assassin'' (China), directed by Chen
Kaige. A king in the third century B.C. aims to unify China and
become its first emperor.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Gemini'' (Japan), directed by Shinya Tsukamoto. A man is
imprisoned and his life taken over by his evil twin.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Harem Suare'' (Italy/France/Turkey), directed by Ferzan
Ozpetek. The sultan's favorite concubine and one of his eunuchs
develop a strange relationship of power and love.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Magnetist's Fifth Winter'' (Denmark/Norway/Sweden),
directed by Morten Henriksen. Life in a small town in Sweden in
1819 is disrupted by the arrival of a stranger who practices
medical hypnotism.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Not of This World'' (Italy), directed by Giuseppe Piccioni.
A young nun finds an abandoned baby and sets out to find the
father.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Vanprastham, the Last Dance'' (India). A woman in 1930s
India falls in love, not with an actor, but with the character he
plays on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Other films that Fitzgerald expects to draw attention include
the U.S. production ``The Mao Game,'' a dark comedy about an
actress-mother and photographer-grandmother who play a game to
decide who gets custody of a young boy; the U.S. premiere of
Italy's ``The Legend of 1900,'' about a newborn boy who is found
aboard an ocean liner, raised by the ship's crew and who becomes
the on-board pianist _ all without setting foot on land; and the
premiere of ``The Third Miracle,'' a U.S. release starring Ed
Harris and Ann Heche, about a disillusioned priest who falls in
love with the daughter of a woman who is a candidate for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   The festival also will pay tribute to composer Elmer Bernstein
and host a symposium on digital cinema and what the new technology
will mean to production, distribution, exhibition and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The AFI Film Festival closes Oct. 29 with award presentations
and a screening of ``All About My Mother,'' for which Pedro
Almodovar won the directing prize at Cannes. It deals with a mother
who, following the death of her only son, searches for the father
he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 60 films in the entire series, including the
classic film retrospective, down from about 75 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think each year our slate just gets that much more lean,''
Fitzgerald said. ``It's a great combination of emerging artists and
highly regarded veteran filmmakers. We've never had such a strong
combination of those two ends of the spectrum.''

 By ANDREA MANDEL-CAMPBELL 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TIJUANA, Mexico _ There are still more employees than customers
at the sumptuous customer service center built by Mexico's newest
telecommunications upstart, Pegaso, in the bustling border town of
Tijuana. Surrounded by equipment displays and eye-catching ads, a
dozen cashiers and sales people await the multitudes that Pegaso
and countless newly licensed telephone companies hope to serve
since Mexico opened the sector to competition.
 &HT;    Many have been slowed by funding problems or stiff competition
from market incumbent Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the former
state run monopoly turned private sector powerhouse, but Pegaso has
quickly created a telephone company from scratch. Since paying $220
million for one of three nation-wide wireless licenses in mid-1998
the company is working furiously to offer fixed and mobile services
in Mexico's four largest citiesrepresenting 60 percent of the
market _ by the end of the year when it hopes to have 100,000
customers.
 &HT;    Marketed as the country's only completely digital network, the
telecom and its list of heavyweight backers are looking to carve
out a niche in Mexico's underdeveloped market by offering
state-of-the-art technology and customer service rarely seen in
Latin America. It's a strategy many hope to duplicate, not only in
Mexico but throughout the region as governments in country after
country open the once-coddled telecommunications industry to
unbridled competition in a bid to provide much-needed phone lines
to consumers.
 &HT;    ``Clearly the lessons learned here will go into creating the
perfect launch model,'' says Dan Pegg, senior vice-president of
Leap Wireless, subsidiary of digital equipment manufacturer,
Qualcomm, and part owner of Pegaso.
 &HT;    As elsewhere in the region, newcomers in Mexico are turning to
wireless systems for fast and comparatively cheap installation.
Already cellular penetration has grown from less than 1 percent of
the population in 1994 to 4.5 percent, with subscriber growth
averaging 90 percent last year alone. The density is still
significantly below countries like Venezuela, with a comparable
domestic growth and a cellular penetration of 8 percent, but
analysts expect the number of subscribers to double to 7.8 million
Mexicans by 2003.
 &HT;    Similarly, the entry of many more new competitors in the next
four years is expected to push the number of fixed lines per 100
inhabitants from 10 to just under 17, boosting total telecom
service revenues from $6.9 billion to more than $11 billion. Of
that, Pegaso figures it can cull 1.6 million fixed and mobile lines
or 10 percent of the market by serving some 70 cities by 2005.
 &HT;    Given those numbers, Pegaso shareholders left nothing to chance
when they launched the new service in Tijuana, Mexico's fastest
growing city located just south of the border from San Diego, the
so-called wireless capital of the United States. Home to several
equipment suppliers including Qualcomm, the inventor of CDMA (Code
Division Multiple Access) digital technology, the San Diego vendors
were able to oversee the installation of more than 50 microwave
base stations in and around Tijuana's rugged hills in record time.
After Tijuana, Pegaso plans to move into Mexico City, Monterrey and
Guadalajara.
 &HT;    Pegaso, like its namesake Pegasus, the winged-horse of Greek
mythology, suggests, is moving quickly to position itself as more
than a dozen new licensees get set to come on line. In Tijuana
alone, there will eventually be five cellular companies to choose
from, not to mention Telmex, which earlier this year announced a
massive two-year, $4.6 billion investment plan to increase its
still sketchy coverage by 48 percent to 20 million lines. ``The
idea was to launch as quickly as possible in order to establish
brand awareness,'' says Juan Moragas, Pegaso regional manager for
Tijuana.
 &HT;    The third player to enter the Tijuana market after Telmex's
cellular phone company Telcel and its main competitor Bajacellular,
Pegaso has nevertheless got an important jump-start over its two
wireless rivals bogged down by financial problems. Midicel, owned
by the Kanahuati family, had its license revoked earlier this year
after it failed to pay its already twice deferred license fee.
Mexican magnate Ricardo Salinas Pliego also delayed payment on his
license for close to year, while he sold 50 percent of his
yet-be-launched phone company, Unefon, in June to rustle up the
cash. He continues to be held up by a litany of court injunctions
filed by rivals arguing preferential treatment by regulatory
authorities.
 &HT;    Like its competitors, Pegaso is the brainchild of a Mexican
tycoon, Alejandro Burillo Azcarraga, but unlike some rivals, Pegaso
is backed by a sturdy international ownership structure. In
addition to his stake in three Mexican soccer teams, Burillo
Azcarraga, the cousin of Televisa Chairman Emilio Azcarraga Jean,
is best known as one of the principal heirs to Televisa, the
world's largest Spanish language broadcaster. Alongside his 30
years experience at the network, Burillo Azcarraga dabbles in
personal investments through his holding company, Grupo Pegaso, and
after a joint venture with Qualcomm in a satellite tracking
enterprise, the idea to launch a telephone company was born.
 &HT;    When it came time to pay the costly licensing fee, the two
partners enlisted the support of financial backers, U.S. bank
Citicorp, venture capital group Latin America Infrastructure Fund,
and the Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai. Together the three
control a 31.25 percent stake in the company. Grupo Pegaso and
Televisa own 28.75 percent and 15 percent respectively while Leap
remains with a quarter of the company. ``Pegaso has thought its
partnerships out very well,'' says Leslie Arathoon, Latin American
telecommunications analyst with Boston-based Pyramid Research.
 &HT;    So far, the five investors have committed $400 million in cash
out of a total planned investment of $1.3 billion to 2005. The
company is looking to take on an additional $300 million in
long-term debt, says Pegaso Chief Financial Officer Juan Marco
Gutierrez, but the bulk of the money is coming from vendor
financing with Qualcomm and Alcatel, who together are providing
$580 million to cover all equipment needs.
 &HT;    The deal is much like the one recently sealed by Axtel, another
local service newcomer. It obtained $750 million in financing from
Nortel Networks, the Canadian equipment supplier and Axtel
shareholder through Bell Canada. ``Most of the new players don't
have capital, so the name of the game is vendor financing,'' says
Arathoon.
 &HT;    With most of the money in place, what Pegaso doesn't have is a
high profile operator like Axtel or long-distance providers Avantel
and Alestra, both of whom partnered up with powerful U.S. telecoms,
MCI Worldcom and AT&AMP;T, respectively. Instead, Pegaso counts on Leap
Wireless to provide start-up support and financial planning and has
contracted GTE out of the United States and British
telecommunications specialist, the Red Wing Group, as consultants
in the areas of billing, customer service and information
technology. GTE alone has brought in 70 expatriates from Sri Lanka
to Australia, while Leap personnel head up Tijuana's 60-person
operation.
 &HT;    Not that Pegaso's Mexican counterparts are mere bystanders.
Televisa's Tijuana TV station doubles as a base for switching
operations. In Mexico City, its strategically placed antennas
provide valuable real estate in the difficult search for available
rooftop relays. More importantly, as Mexico's most watched TV
network, it serves as a powerful advertising vehicle and an
informed source for marketing strategy _ particularly when
televising soccer games. Through Burillo's influential ties, the
Pegaso logo has made it onto the uniform of the Mexican national
soccer team as well as into the country's two largest stadiums.
 &HT;    ``Everyone brings a different value-added to the table and Mr.
Burillo has the confidence, know how and experience of launching a
product in Mexico,'' says Pegaso's Gutierrez. In Tijuana the
results are already being felt. Despite the muted traffic at
Pegaso's two shiny new service centers, the company had garnered
4,000 subscribers by mid-year, 30 percent more than forecasted
levels, says Daniel Gomez, the company's regional sales director.
New customers complain the service is still patchy but they've been
won over by the company's promise to provide better voice quality
as well as a new roaming agreement with U.S. telecom Sprint that
will allow them to use their phones across the border in the United
States.
 &HT;    Much of the success, says Gomez, is owed to the company's
innovative distribution strategy. Through a new product dubbed
``Phone in a Box'' Pegaso sells its handsets already activated with
100 pesos (about $10) of free time in supermarkets, clothing and
convenience stores and several Televisa subsidiaries, including
PayTV outlets and video centers.
 &HT;    Once hooked, the company makes it easy for customers to stay
connected. ``We're trying to present the telephone business as
simply as possible,'' says CFO Gutierrez. Unlike other cellular
services, which ask for innumerable references before tying
subscribers into one of a dozen equally confusing and endless
contracts, Pegaso offers three plans; one prepaid and two billing
programs. In all cases, no contract is signed and only a credit
card is needed if the client prefers a monthly payment plan. ``What
the country is looking for right now are new options,'' says Gomez.
 &HT;    Those new options will eventually include fixed wireless
service, currently in the testing stage, and a whole spectrum of
data transmission alternatives ranging from retrieving e-mail to
sending short messages by mobile phone. ``There is a whole new
market opening up,'' says Ake Persson, president of Ericsson
Wireless Communications Inc., a division that the Swedish
telecommunications manufacturer recently acquired from Qualcomm.
 &HT;    The acquisition has converted Ericsson into one of Pegaso's two
main suppliers and marks the first time the multinational is
working with one of its chief industry rivals, Alcatel. On the
strength of their experience at Pegaso, the long-time competitors
plan to bid jointly on upcoming projects, says Persson, with
Alcatel providing the switching and Ericsson, the radio network.
 &HT;    For Ericsson, a traditional supplier to many of the region's
wireline monoliths, Pegaso also marks an important new testing
ground for its newly acquired CDMA digital technology. The next
generation in wireless, ``CDMA magic,'' as it is often referred to
in the industry, allows for greater spectrum efficiency, resulting
in a higher volume of calls and improved voice quality thanks to
the higher 1.9 MHz PCS frequency.
 &HT;    The combination is increasingly considered the option of the
future in Latin America, according to those in the industry. For
Ericsson's Persson, it could represent as much as ``one-third of
the region's future market.'' Adds Pegg at Leap Wireless, ``There
is no question wireless is the solution of choice because of the
cost factor. There is no digging up of streets or laying wire, and
in emerging countries where infrastructure is just beginning, you
can put in so much more for the same amount of money at a much
faster rate.''
 &HT;    In Mexico, the technology is particularly attractive as
government authorities aim to double the country's relatively low
telephone density to 20 fixed lines per 100 inhabitants by 2005.
Their efforts have been somewhat obstructed however by Mexico's
dubious regulatory climate and the tenacious defence of market
leader Telmex.
 &HT;    New entrants like Alestra and Avantel say they have lost
millions to unfair practices and outrageous interconnections rates
charged by Telmex for outside operators to terminate a call in its
network. In the case of calling party pays, a well-known boon to
mobile phone use in several Latin American countries, Telmex
successfully blocked for months the introduction of the system,
which charges the cost of dialing up to the caller.
 &HT;    When the system was finally launched earlier this year, Telmex
added an interconnection fee of six cents per minute compared to a
regional average of two to four cents. The igh rate made the cost
of calling a cellular phone comparable to a national long-distance
call.
 &HT;    Regulatory authorities are expected to review rates for calling
party pays by the end of the year and those at Pegaso are
optimistic the system will eventually spark increased mobile phone
use. In the meantime, the company says its strategy is not to steal
customers from the competition but to sign on the millions of
Mexicans still without a telephone. ``Once Telmex realizes there's
more business than all of us can say grace over they will be easier
to deal with,'' says Pegg at Leap Wireless. ``Nobody in all honesty
can tell you how big this market really is.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Little ballerinas, ghosts and superheroes may find
it a bit crowded on the trick-or-treat trail this year.
</P>
<P>
   They, and other traditional costumes such as witches, devils and
demons, have some major competition.
</P>
<P>
   It's Pokemon, that little computer game twerp with a tail,
reports Steve Moylan, spokesman for Mervyn's California stores. And
right behind him in popularity, says Moylan, are ``Star Wars''
characters such as Queen Amidala, Anakin Skywalker and Darth Maul.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story at Target stores. ``Everybody wants Pokemon.
It's the hottest seller ever, but we're sold out and don't expect
any more deliveries,'' said Target's Woodland Hills store manager
Chan Parks. He says he has no idea why the costume is more popular
than others, such as the also-cuddly Furby and Teletubbies, but
reports the biggest Pokemon fans are boys under 10 who also collect
the Pokemon trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   Can't find a costume? Run to your nearest fabric store. They've
got patterns for those who can sew and wield a hot glue gun. Even
Pokemon and the more intricate ``Star Wars'' patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Why not a ghost or goblin?
</P>
<P>
   According to Home Sewing Association spokeswoman Judy
Mayenhofer, ``Trick-or-treaters celebrating the final Halloween
before the millennium will be struck by movie madness. Characters
from hit films, clever cartoons and TV shows are the
front-runners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pokemon and his pals are just kid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The really big deal is adult-sized monsters, mummies, aliens,
wrestlers, clowns and sexy devils who are horning their way into
the holiday ritual. We're talking (BEGIN ITAL)really(END ITAL) big
costumes, even a new line by Disguise Inc. (one of the nation's
leading costume manufacturers), that caters to plus-size women who
want to dress up as French maids or witches.
</P>
<P>
   Adults are also following that movies-for-the-millennium theme
at costume rental places. ``This year, it's costumes with a French
court theme from `Interview With the Vampire,' `Dangerous
Liaisons,' and the new KCET series `Aristocrats' that customers
want,'' says Jenny Eagan, manager of the Halloween division of
Western Costumes in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Think all this Halloween hooey is just media hype?
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1999 American Express Retail Index, 54 percent
of all consumers feel Halloween has become as much a holiday for
adults as for kids. And that's up from 48 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So that means more costumed characters ringing doorbells and
vying for treats.
</P>
<P>
   The Halloween Association (yes, there really is one that works
as a clearinghouse for the costume trade) estimates that we're
spending about $1.5 billion annually on costumes, with 82 percent
of all children dressing up and 73 percent of all adults.
</P>
<P>
   American Express' report breaks that down to an average spending
spree of $98 per family, which doesn't go very far, since most
costumes are priced from $16 to $35, with accessories priced
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Then crank in the baby factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that parents would wait until their children
were toddlers to get them dressed up. Now adults are taking their
children more places, and they want them to look stylish. It's
definitely a case of have baby, will travel,'' says Jeff Coppens,
spokesman for Disguise Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the family who trick-or-treats together stays together. At
least parents will have their own candy stash.

 &HT;    MEXICANS' PERPETUAL DISTRUST INTRUDES ON POLITICAL CHANGES,
ELECTIONS
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Oct. 23 And Thereafter.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ They range from highly educated financial experts
to homemakers and day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But they share one thing in common: no matter how many reforms
are enacted, how many promises are made, they all think the Mexican
government lies, cheats and steals.
</P>
<P>
   They're Mexico's perpetual skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 years of virtual one-party rule in Mexico _ and many
crises and disappointments _ Mexicans often have trouble believing
the official word on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Many don't believe the official story that only one gunman
killed Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate who was
assassinated during a campaign rally in 1994. Many don't believe
the official line that the fugitive governor of Quintana Roo state
_ Mario Villanueva _ was able to escape surveillance and flee the
country just days before he was to be arrested on drug charges last
April.
</P>
<P>
   And many still don't believe that the first-ever presidential
primary election _ to be held by Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, on Nov. 7 _ represents a true step
toward more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans live in a permanent state of suspicion,'' said
international economic consultant Rogelio Ramirez de la O(CQ), who
himself often doubts that political reforms here are genuine,
especially when it comes to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is the core of Mexico's national political life and,
some say, the reason why Mexicans tend to be so skeptical of their
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've swallowed the bitter pill too many times,'' said
Guadalupe Loaeza, who writes a column on politics and culture for
Mexico City's Reforma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari represented the
latest in decades of disappointments and broken promises, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas de Gortari vowed to pull Mexicans out of Third World
status in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But that ``seductive
vision'' faded after the Mexican peso crashed just after Salinas
left office, she said, plunging half of the country deeper into
poverty. Salinas' brother and some of his other PRI political
associates have been linked to drug traffickers who paid officials
huge bribes during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans were left more disillusioned than ever during the seven
decades since 1929 that the PRI has controlled Mexico's highest
political office.
</P>
<P>
   After reforms pushed by opposition parties to make elections
cleaner, the PRI finally lost its absolute majority in Mexico's
Congress two years ago. The PRI still controls a majority of
governors' seats but it has lost several important states in recent
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospects of more losses _ perhaps even the
constitutionally powerful presidency _ the PRI has tried to remake
itself into a more attractive, democratic option whose sheer
experience outstrips the opposition. Key to that image is its
upcoming primary, which represents the first time voters will be
allowed to choose the party's nominee for Mexico's July 2, 2000,
presidential election. Up to now, the president of the republic has
always picked the party's nominee in a secret selection process
nicknamed the ``dedazo,'' or ``big finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the public's jaded view of its old authoritarian
ways, the party has coined a new slogan plastered on billboards and
heard on frequent radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new PRI for the new millennium. A new PRI much closer to
you,'' is the message encouraging Mexicans to participate in the
November primary. Any Mexican with a voter credential will be
permitted to cast a ballot, not just PRI members.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems less than overwhelmed by the PRI's attempts to
show new colors, however.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this month found that only 36 percent believe the PRI
primary will be ``totally honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a slight improvement over the poll we took in June.
That was only 31 percent,'' laughed Vicente Licona, director of
Mexico's Indemerc-Louis Harris polling operation, which did the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   In Indemerc-Louis Harris' June poll, taken before the primary
campaign was in full force, 50 percent of respondents thought the
party had already decided who would win the election. Fifty-four
percent thought Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, had already
made his selection in a de facto dedazo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe a real democracy exists within the official
party (the PRI),'' said Antonio Reyes, a Mexico City chemical
engineer, whose views reflect that current of disbelief among
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the method they're using to choose their candidate is
the same that it's always been,'' Reyes added. ``They've just
dressed up the 'dedazo' so they can say there is more democracy.
They've got four pseudo-candidates, but we all know who is already
the one who is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually aggressive campaigning by one candidate _ Roberto
Madrazo _ has convinced people that the competition among the PRI
is real, Licona said. But most people seem to believe that
Madrazo's chief rival, Francisco Labastida, already has the
election in the bag because he appears to be the favorite choice of
President Zedillo and the PRI elite.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate in September, the four PRI contenders
displayed unusual hostility and criticism toward one another.
Madrazo attacked Labastida with unprecedented vigor, challenging
his competence. Labastida shot back by labeling Madrazo a two-faced
liar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare display of competition that was billed as a sign
of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez de la O said he found himself staring at the screen,
searching for hints that the whole primary campaign was a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that Madrazo's campaign has been sincere,'' he
said. ``But the possibility of a negotiation with the government
(for a powerful position if he loses) is still one of the cards
Madrazo has to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Licona was even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The internal election of the PRI is perceived as fraudulent
and dishonest and already fixed,'' he said. ``In Mexico we've never
believed in elections. We've always thought there was fraud by the
PRI. And so now people are supposed to believe in an election run
by the PRI itself?''
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexico's election laws do not govern primaries, the
party will supervise the balloting on Nov. 7. Betting much of their
party's bid for more credibility on the primary, the party's
leaders have pledged to make the election as clean as possible.
Polls show Labastida and Madrazo running about even. Insiders are
predicting that about 80 percent of those who turn out to vote will
be PRI loyalists. If they are not satisfied that the results were
legitimate, there is a chance the PRI could fracture into
quarreling camps and go into next summer's election weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Martinez, an 82-year-old grandmother, says she won't be
one of those who goes to the polls on Nov. 7 or on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every election (presidential) candidates promise change, and
then they end their terms with things worse off than when they
started,'' she said. ``They say their party (the PRI) has changed.
But I'm old and I see the same deception I've seen every election.
Why pretend when we already know who is going to win?''

 Por ANDREA MANDEL-CAMPBELL 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TIJUANA, Mexico _ Todavia hay mas empleados que clientes en el
suntuoso centro de servicio al cliente construido por la empresa de
telecomunicaciones mas nueva de Mexico, Pegaso, en la concurrida
ciudad fronteriza de Tijuana. Rodeados por exposiciones de equipos
y anuncios llamativos, una docena de cajeros y vendedores esperan a
las multitudes que Pegaso y muchas otras telefonicas recien
autorizadas esperan desde que Mexico abrio el sector a la
competencia.
 &HT;    Muchas empresas han sufrido retrasos por problemas de
financiacion o la renida competencia del lider del mercado,
Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), el antiguo monopolio estatal, pero
Pegaso se ha establecido con rapidez practicamente de cero. Desde
que pago US$220 millones por una de las tres licencias de servicio
inalambrico nacional a mediados de 1998, la compania trabaja con
afan para ofrecer servicios fijos y moviles en las cuatro ciudades
mas importantes de Mexico, que constituyen el 60 por ciento del
mercado, para fines de ano, cuando espera tener 100.000 clientes.
 &HT;    Pegaso, que se anuncia como la unica red completamente digital
del pais, y su lista de poderosos patrocinadores, tratan de ocupar
un nicho en el subdesarrollado mercado mexicano con una oferta de
tecnologia avanzada y un servicio al cliente rara vez visto en
America Latina. Es una estrategia que muchos quieren copiar, en
Mexico y en toda la region, a medida que los gobiernos abren el
sector a la competencia para aumentar el acceso de la poblacion a
las necesitadas lineas telefonicas.
 &HT;    ``Es obvio que las lecciones que hemos aprendido aqui serviran
para crear el modelo de lanzamiento perfecto,'' dice Dan Pegg,
vicepresidente de Leap Wireless, filial del fabricante de equipos
digitales Qualcomm y que tiene una participacion en Pegaso.
 &HT;    Como en otras partes de la region, las empresas que llegan por
primera vez a Mexico prefieren los sistemas inalambricos por su
instalacion rapida y relativamente barata. La penetracion de la
telefonia celular ha crecido de menos del 1 por ciento de la
poblacion en 1994 al 4,5 por ciento, y en 1998 el aumento promedio
de suscriptores fue del 90 por ciento. La densidad aun es menor que
paises como Venezuela, que tiene un crecimiento similar y una
penetracion de la telefonia celular del 8 por ciento, pero los
analistas esperan que los suscriptores aumenten a 7,8 millones, en
el 2003.
 &HT;    Del mismo modo, la llegada de mas competidores en los proximos
cuatro anos debe elevar la cantidad de lineas fijas, de 10 por cada
100 habitantes a casi 17, lo que hara aumentar los ingresos por
concepto de servicios de comunicaciones de US$6.900 millones a mas
de US$11.000 millones. De esa suma, Pegaso calcula que podra
acaparar 1,6 millones de lineas fijas y moviles (el 10 por ciento
por ciento del mercado), prestando servicio a unas 70 ciudades en
el 2005.
 &HT;    Con esas cifras, los accionistas de Pegaso no corrieron grandes
riesgos cuando se inauguro el servicio en Tijuana, la ciudad que
mas rapidamente crece en Mexico, situada frente a San Diego, la
capital de la telefonia inalambrica de Estados Unidos y sede de
fabricantes como Qualcomm, inventor de la tecnologia digital CDMA.
Los distribuidores de San Diego supervisaron la instalacion de mas
de 50 repetidoras de microondas en las colinas de Tijuana en tiempo
record. Despues de Tijuana, Pegaso planea entrar en la Ciudad de
Mexico, Monterrey y Guadalajara.
 &HT;    Con la rapidez del mitologico caballo alado del mismo nombre,
Pegaso se coloca rapidamente en la linea de partida junto a mas de
una decena de telefonicas. Solo en Tijuana, con el tiempo habra
cinco empresas celulares, por no mencionar a Telmex, que a
principios de ano anuncio un plan de inversiones de US$4.600
millones a dos anos para incrementar su cobertura a 20 millones de
lineas. ``Queriamos lanzar rapidamente el servicio con el fin de
dar a conocer la marca,'' dice Juan Moragas, gerente regional de
Pegaso en Tijuana.
 &HT;    Pegaso, la tercera empresa en entrar en el mercado de Tijuana
despues de la telefonica celular Telcel, de Telmex, y de su
principal rival, Baja Celular (Bajacel), comenzo con ventaja sobre
sus dos competidores inalambricos, afectados por problemas
financieros. A Midicel, propiedad de la familia Kanahauti, le
revocaron la licencia a principios de este ano por no pagar la
cuota correspondiente. El magnate Ricardo Salinas Pliego tambien
retraso el pago de su licencia casi por un ano, aunque en junio
vendio el 50 por ciento de su telefonica Unefon (que aun no ha
entrado en operaciones) para reunir el efectivo. Salinas sigue
obstaculizado por un sinfin de requerimientos judiciales
presentados por rivales que acusan a las autoridades de darle un
trato preferencial.
 &HT;    Pegaso es la idea del magnate mexicano Alejandro Burillo
Azcarraga, pero a diferencia de algunos rivales esta respaldado por
una fuerte estructura de propiedad internacional. Ademas de sus
intereses en tres equipos mexicanos de futbol, Burillo Azcarraga,
primo del presidente de Televisa, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, es uno de
los principales herederos de Televisa, la mayor cadena de TV en
espanol del mundo. Junto a sus 30 anos de experiencia en la cadena,
Burillo Azcarraga hace inversiones personales a traves de su
compania holding, Grupo Pegaso, y despues de una empresa conjunta
con Qualcomm en una empresa de rastreo satelital, nacio la idea de
crear una compania telefonica.
 &HT;    Cuando llego el momento de pagar la costosa cuota de la
licencia, los dos socios buscaron el apoyo financiero de Citicorp,
el grupo de capital de riesgo Latin America Infrastructure Fund y
la comercializadora japonesa Nissho Iwai. Juntas, las tres
controlan una participacion del 31,25 por ciento en la empresa.
Grupo Pegaso y Televisa tienen el 28,75 por ciento y el 15 por
ciento, respectivamente, mientras Leap tiene una cuarta parte.
``Pegaso ha estudiado muy bien sus asociaciones,'' comenta Leslie
Arathoon, analista de telecomunicaciones en America Latina de
Pyramid Research, de Boston.
 &HT;    Hasta ahora, los cinco inversionistas han destinado US$400
millones en efectivo, de una inversion total planeada de US$1.300
millones para el 2005. La compania estudia tomar otros US$300
millones en deuda a largo plazo, dice Juan Marco Gutierrez,
director de finanzas de Pegaso, pero el grueso del dinero proviene
de suministradores como Qualcomm y Alcatel, que aportan US$580
millones para costear los equipos necesarios.
 &HT;    El acuerdo es muy parecido al que recientemente firmo Axtel,
otra nueva telefonica. Axtel consiguio US$750 millones en
financiamiento de Nortel Networks, suministrador canadiense de
equipos y accionista de Axtel a traves de Bell Canada. ``La mayor
parte de las nuevas empresas no tienen capital, de modo que los
suministradores tambien financian la venta,'' dice Arathoon.
 &HT;    Pegaso ya ha conseguido la mayor parte del dinero necesario,
pero le falta el reconocimiento que tienen Axtel y los proveedores
de larga distancia Avantel y Alestra, que se asociaron con las
poderosas firmas norteamericanas MCI Worldcom y AT&AMP;T,
respectivamente. Pegaso cuenta con Leap Wireless para la
planificacion financiera y el respaldo para entrar en operacion, y
ha contratado a GTE, de Estados Unidos, y al Red Wing Group,
especialista en telecomunicaciones britanico, como consultores en
los segmentos de facturacion, servicio al cliente y tecnologia
informatica. GTE ha traido a 70 empleados de paises asiaticos,
mientras personal de Leap dirige la operacion en Tijuana.
 &HT;    No es que los homologos mexicanos de Pegaso sean simples
espectadores. La estacion de television de Televisa en Tijuana
tambien funciona como base de operaciones de conmutacion. En Ciudad
de Mexico, sus antenas colocadas estrategicamente alivian la
congestion de las azoteas al servir tambien como repetidores. Lo
que es mas importante: como es la cadena de television de mas
audiencia en Mexico, representa un poderoso vehiculo de publicidad
y una fuente informada de estrategia de mercadeo, sobre todo cuando
transmite partidos de futbol. A traves de las influyentes
relaciones de Burillo, el logo de Pegaso se ha abierto paso hasta
el uniforme del equipo nacional de futbol y hasta los dos estadios
mayores del pais.
 &HT;    ``Todo el mundo aporta un valor agregado distinto. El senor
Burillo tiene la confianza, el conocimiento y la experiencia de
lanzar un producto en Mexico,'' dice Gutierrez, de Pegaso.
 &HT;    En Tijuana ya se ven los resultados. A pesar del silencio en los
dos nuevos centros de servicio de Pegaso, la compania capto 4.000
suscriptores a mediados de ano, 30 por ciento mas que el nivel
proyectado, dice Daniel Gomez, director de ventas regionales de la
compania. Los nuevos clientes se quejan de que el servicio todavia
es muy irregular, pero los convencio la promesa de una mejor
calidad de sonido y un nuevo acuerdo con Sprint que les permitira
usar sus telefonos en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Gomez dice que gran parte del exito se debe a la innovadora
estrategia de distribucion de la compania. A traves de un nuevo
producto apodado ``Telefono en caja,'' Pegaso vende sus telefonos
ya activados con 100 pesos (unos US$10) de tiempo gratis en
supermercados, tiendas y varias filiales de Televisa, como
establecimientos de PayTV y centros de video.
 &HT;    ``Tratamos de presentar el negocio telefonico lo mas
sencillamente posible,'' dice Gutierrez, director de finanzas. A
diferencia de otros servicios celulares, que piden innumerables
referencias antes de amarrar a los suscriptores a una decena de
contratos interminables y confusos, Pegaso ofrece tres planes: uno
pagado por adelantado y dos programas de facturacion, no hay que
firmar ningun contrato y solo hace falta una tarjeta de credito si
el cliente prefiere pagar mensualmente. ``Lo que el pais busca en
estos momentos son opciones nuevas,'' afirma Gomez.
 &HT;    Entre esas opciones estara el servicio inalambrico fijo,
actualmente en periodo de prueba, y muchas alternativas de
transmision de datos, desde recoger correo electronico hasta enviar
mensajes cortos por telefono movil. ``Se esta abriendo un mercado
nuevo,'' dice Ake Persson, presidente de Ericsson Wireless
Communications Inc., una division que el fabricante sueco de
telecomunicaciones adquirio recientemente de Qualcomm.
 &HT;    La adquisicion ha convertido a Ericsson en uno de los dos
principales suministradores de Pegaso y marca la primera vez que la
multinacional trabaja con uno de sus mayores rivales en el sector,
Alcatel. Basandose en su experiencia en Pegaso, los viejos
competidores planean buscar conjuntamente futuros proyectos, dice
Persson. En ese plan, Alcatel pondria la conmutacion y Ericsson la
red de radio.
 &HT;    Para Ericsson, suministrador tradicional, Pegaso tambien es un
importante campo de pruebas para su recien adquirida tecnologia
digital CDMA. La proxima generacion de la telefonia inalambrica,
``la magia de CDMA,'' como se suele llamar, permite un mayor
volumen de llamadas y una mayor calidad de sonido.
 &HT;    Esta combinacion es cada vez mas la alternativa del futuro en
America Latina, segun analistas del sector. Para Persson, de
Ericsson, podria representar hasta ``un tercio del mercado futuro
de la region.'' Pegg, de Leap Wireless, apunta: ``No hay duda de
que la telefonia inalambrica es la solucion preferida debido al
factor costo. No hay que romper las calles ni tender cables, y en
las economias emergentes, donde hay poca infraestructura, se puede
hacer mucho mas con la misma cantidad de dinero a un ritmo mucho
mas rapido.''
 &HT;    En Mexico, la tecnologia es muy atractiva porque las autoridades
esperan duplicar la densidad telefonica a 20 lineas fijas por cada
100 habitantes para el 2005. Pero sus esfuerzos han enfrentado el
obstaculo de las regulaciones del gobierno y la tenaz defensa del
lider del mercado, Telmex.
 &HT;    Nuevas figuras en el mercado como Alestra y Avantel dicen que
han perdido millones debido a metodos desleales y tarifas de
inteconexion exorbitantes que Telmex cobra a los operadores
externos para pasar una llamada a su red. Telmex obstruyo durante
meses la introduccion del sistema en el que la persona que llama es
la que paga, muy popular en America Latina.
 &HT;    Cuando por fin se establecio el sistema a principios de este
ano, Telmex agrego una cuota de interconexion de seis centavos por
minuto, mientras el promedio regional es de dos a cuatro centavos.
Esto hace las llamadas celulares casi tan costosas como una llamada
de larga distancia.
 &HT;    Se espera que las autoridades revisen las tarifas de este
sistema a fines de ano, y en Pegaso se piensa que a la larga eso
generara un mayor uso de la telefonia movil. Entretanto, la
compania dice que su estrategia no es robarle clientes a la
competencia, sino suscribir a los millones de mexicanos que todavia
no tienen telefono. ``Cuando Telmex entienda que hay mas negocio
que el que todos nosotros podemos manejar, sera mas facil tratar
con ellos,'' dice Pegg, de Leap Wireless. ``Nadie conoce con
exactitud la envergadura de este mercado.''

DOLE ENDS WHITE HOUSE BID, CITES BUSH MONEY MACHINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican presidential field shrunk again
Wednesday as Elizabeth Dole abandoned her pioneering quest for the
White House because, she said, she was unable to compete with
George W. Bush's mighty money machine.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Dole, who had been running a distant second to
Bush in most polls, is likely to further strengthen the Texas
governor's front-runner status as the 2000 primary season
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   However, political experts said they were uncertain if many of
the young, independent female voters that Dole drew to her rallies
will remain engaged in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although she declined to endorse any of her rivals or discuss
future plans, Dole's decision to bow out stoked speculation that
she may want to be Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   In her announcement, Dole took a subtle dig at Bush by noting
that the emphasis on his war chest made it harder for her to get
her message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line remains money,'' she told a roomful of
reporters at a Washington hotel. ``There (is a tendency to make)
money the message ... And people outside the Beltway don't really
understand why their enthusiasm and these big crowds isn't the
measure of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's departure may boost the presidential campaign fortunes of
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a maverick lawmaker who appeals to
independents and who has already replaced Dole as Bush's major
threat in the first primary state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Her quitting also underscores what some experts believe is a
worrisome trend in presidential politics, where the need to raise
lots of cash early to compete in an increasingly front-loaded
primary season has forced many candidates out months before the
first votes are cast.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Republican field has dwindled from a dozen
candidates earlier this year to half that now. The remaining
contenders include Bush, McCain, millionaire magazine publisher
Steve Forbes, who is financing most of his own campaign;
conservative activists Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Utah Sen. Orrin
Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Another former GOP candidate, conservative firebrand Pat
Buchanan, is expected to announce Monday that he will seek the
Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A 63-year old Harvard Law School graduate who served in the
Reagan and Bush Cabinets, Dole enjoyed an initial burst of positive
media attention and voter interest last winter when she announced
she was leaving as head of the Red Cross to explore a presidential
bid.
</P>
<P>
   She had burnished her public image earlier with a polished
performance during the 1996 Republican convention where she roamed
the arena in talk-show like fashion touting the virtues of her
husband, GOP nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   As the novelty wore off over the spring and summer, her
candidacy could not gain traction. Political experts attributed it
to poor organization, lack of a compelling message and inability to
compete with Bush's unprecedented fund-raising. Even a strong third
place showing in the Iowa straw poll in August did not direct the
money to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, Bush had raised $56 million compared
with Dole's $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who on the stump often spoke of her achievements in
overcoming gender barriers, said she did not believe that her
pulling out of the race would discourage other young women about
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've done is pave the way for the person who
will be the first woman president,'' Dole said, adding that when
she addressed largely female crowds, ``it's almost as if you see
some women sitting up a little straighter because you're trying to
empower them to understand that they can do it; they can really
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   During her withdrawal speech, Dole praised her husband, the
former Senate Republican leader, who stood behind her as she spoke
and even appeared tearful. But Bob Dole had made public comments
that undermined his wife's efforts. He publicly raised doubts that
she could win and said he would contribute $1,000 to McCain's rival
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that while Dole's complaints about fund-raising are
valid, she also must share some of the blame for failing to
capitalize on the initial burst of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said she was not prepared to set up the state
organizations needed to marshal volunteers and build support. A
demanding boss, she suffered from high staff turnover that included
the loss of her press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   A North Carolina native who has spent most of her adult years in
Washington, Dole rarely deviated from her well-scripted speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Her fall in fortunes in New Hampshire, the first primary state,
are particularly striking. According to a poll released Wednesday
by the American Research Group, Dole was garnering only 3 percent
of the primary vote, tying for fourth place with Keyes. Last
February, the poll showed Dole with 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole has frequently been mentioned as a possible running
mate for Bush, the Texas governor did not broach the issue at a
campaign appearance in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called Dole ``a trailblazer. She is an inspiration for a
lot of women. She made a mark on the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultant Whit Ayres said he believed
Dole's supporters would split among Bush and McCain.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The story of Brandon Teena, a young Nebraska woman
who was convinced _ and convinced many people around her _ that she
was really a boy, has been gone over in numerous articles and a
television documentary. There has been something missing from most
of this coverage, something ``Boys Don't Cry'' seeks to supply.
</P>
<P>
   The movie comes within spitting distance of illuminating the
whole, sordidly fascinating story, or at least shrewdly speculating
on it. In the process, director and co-writer Kimberly Peirce
proves herself an astonishingly gifted filmmaker, already in full
command of performance and picture on her first feature.
</P>
<P>
   But even played by an actress as emotionally free and
chameleonlike as Hilary Swank, Brandon remains a bit of an enigma.
Inevitable, perhaps; how can we ever explain a person whose need to
deceive was so intimately and inexplicably intertwined with her
need for love? Still, something's lacking in the portrayal of
Brandon _ call it a conscience _ that most reports have overlooked
due to her status as a hate crime casualty.
</P>
<P>
   But that's something that nags you after the film is over. While
it's playing, the movie is all but mesmerizing, so thoroughly does
it detail dead-end heartland life and dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the story, Brandon Teena was really
Teena Brandon, a congenital liar with a whopping case of gender
confusion. She'd cut her hair, bind her breasts, stick a sock in
her jeans and pick up girls in Lincoln bars. This generally
resulted in getting chased by angry brothers, and the cops were no
kinder when they'd catch her vandalizing cars or forging checks.
</P>
<P>
   One night, she escaped to tiny Falls City, about 75 miles down a
flat, empty highway. There, in her Brandon persona, she quickly
made friends with two young ex-cons, John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard)
and Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III), and somehow convinced half
the teen-age girls in town that she was their dream boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how crude and violent the indigenous male population
was, the delusions made a kind of sense. The film limits Brandon's
romantic escapades pretty much to one girl, Lana Tisdel, who is
beautifully played here by Chloe Sevigny with all the headstrong
longing and guarded vulnerability a teen-ager in love can possess.
The real-life Tisdel _ and you may want to skip the rest of this
paragraph if you're unfamiliar with the case and wish to be
surprised _ has filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers, who place
her at the scene of Teena's murder, among other acts of artistic
license.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brandon-Lana relationship forms the film's heart,
there is abundant life in every corner of ``Boys Don't Cry.''
Peirce and her actors capture the wayward existence of smalltown
outcasts with uncanny perception. With the help of cinematographer
Jim Denault, she also displays an uncanny instinct for when and how
to place a camera in the midst of volatile groups, where the
dynamic can turn violent in the blink of an eye and no one _
especially if they're pretending to be something they're not _ can
relax.
</P>
<P>
   As good as everyone is here, Swank inevitably steals the show. A
former ``Beverly Hills 90210'' regular, of all things, she not only
makes us forget that Brandon is a woman, Swank turns us into
co-conspirators in her gleeful, dangerous masquerade. We feel what
Brandon feels, from paranoia to exhilaration to devastation and
terror.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing we don't feel is a real sense of guilt. Sure,
Brandon apologizes when she's confronted with the truth and
threatened with grievous harm, but it hardly seems heartfelt.
Brandon was clearly no sociopath _ she was too emotionally needy _
and as long as Peirce and company were changing facts and inventing
some behavior, they should have addressed the most obvious conflict
in Brandon's confused life.
</P>
<P>
   Victim of narrowmindedness, homophobia and identity crisis she
inarguably was. But just because that will be enough to jerk
sympathy from all enlightened, right-thinking people, it's still a
shame to rob Brandon Teena of a soul. &QL;

   &UR; THE CRUSADES, EVEN NOW, CHURN MODERN LIFE
 &UR; (1,700 words)
 &UR; By KAREN ARMSTRONG
</P>
<P>
   When Pope Urban II summoned the knights of Europe to take part
in the First Crusade in November 1095, he could not have imagined
the enduring effects of his enterprise. The pope hoped a crusade
would bring peace to war-torn Europe and enhance the power of the
Western church. Instead of fighting one another in pointless feudal
wars, the pope believed, the knights should join forces, march to
Jerusalem and rescue Christ's tomb from the infidels. He had
envisioned a conventional military campaign but found to his
astonishment that he had launched a mass movement. With the
Crusades, the West found its soul. But it is their tragic legacy
that is felt most keenly today, particularly in the Middle East.

   &UR; THE LIVES OF THE MYSTIC SAINTS OFFER A CRUEL LESSON FOR TODAY'S
WOMEN
 &UR; (3,600 words)
 &UR; By JENNIFER EGAN
</P>
<P>
   An appetite for self-mortification would prove one of the Saint
Catherine of Siena's most enduring traits, and would lead to her
death, at 33, of starvation. In this respect, Catherine's behavior
in the 14th century foreshadowed that of a great many women today
for whom power and suffering _ often self-inflicted _ are curiously
intertwined. Modern-day anorexics, bulimics and self-injurers
experience an illusion of control through disciplining or
mutilating their bodies, echoing the pious self-punishments of
Catherine's time. The lives of Catherine and other saints like her
can help to explain why these impulses persist among women _ from
athletes and models to Princess Diana _ when both the world and the
position of women in it have been radically transformed.

 &UR; By DENNIS OVERBYE
</P>
<P>
   ``What interests me,'' Albert Einstein once remarked, ``is
whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.'' The
question was just his way of asking whether the universe could be
any other way than it appears to be -- and if not, how much room
remains for chance and miracles? There is no reason to think we
will ever be Godlike enough in our comprehension to unlock this
cosmic secret. It may be that humans are fated only to know many
small truths rather than the one big truth, as we spin off
``marvels'' like space flight and the World Wide Web.

   &UR; ON THE ROAD WITH ST. FRANCIS of ASSISI
 &UR; (4,000 words)
 &UR; By GRETEL EHRLICH
</P>
<P>
   The road from Assisi to Gubbio is sometimes a footpath, a horse
track, a Roman street and now, a gravel road that winds through
peaks and valleys dotted with tiny farms and fortresslike
monasteries where 13th-century travelers could spend the night. It
is called the Sentiero Francescano della Pace because it is the
path that Francesco di Bernardone _ better known as St. Francis _
is believed to have taken after he stood naked in Assisi's central
piazza, renounced family and friends and set out on the journey
that effectively defined the rest of his life as wanderer, seeker,
ultimately saint. What is it in a life that leads a medieval
playboy to sainthood, and where does the path begin? That's what
Gretel Ehrlich wondered 800 years later as she stepped onto the
Sentiero and followed Francesco's footsteps out of Assisi.

   &UR; POPE CELESTINE V WAS AN UNWILLING HOLY MAN
 &UR; (500 words)

</P>
<P>
   Celestine V, the only pope in history to have resigned, is the
millennium's best pontiff, according to the author A.N. Wilson. The
85-year-old peasant mystic was elected in 1294, at a time when the
papal throne had been empty for two years, thanks to infighting by
the Mafia-style bosses who ran the medieval church. He resigned
five months later. Dante placed him in Hell for his gran rifuito,
his abdication. But this was an unwilling holy man who knew there
was no meeting place between the pursuit of power and the worship
of God.

   &UR; `CITY ON A HILL' SERMON OFFERED THE BIBLE AS CIVIC BLUEPRINT
 &UR; (1,500 words)
 &UR; By PETER J. GOMES
</P>
<P>
   The definitive sermon of the last 1,000 years was delivered in
1630 when the layman Robert Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, preached to his fellow immigrants while still at sea
aboard the ship Arbella. ``Christian Charity: A Model Hereof,'' is
what Winthrop called his sermon, and it would have languished in
obscurity were it not for its felicitous use of a biblical image _
that of the ``city set on a hill'' _ to describe the moral purpose
of the Pilgrims' adventure into the unknown. That image, familiar
to generations of Christians from Jesus' ``Sermon on the Mount'' in
Matthew's gospel, is what gave Winthrop's sermon life. And it
provided perhaps the most enduring metaphor of the American
experience, that of the exemplary nation _ the ``city on a hill''

   The fact that we can get a connection to anywhere today, almost

fact that friends and bosses can find us so easily means that it is

Ocean on the California coast, tolling bells mark out a centered

   &UR; ON THE ROAD WITH ST. FRANCIS of ASSISI
 &UR; (4,000 words)
 &UR; By GRETEL EHRLICH
</P>
<P>
   The road from Assisi to Gubbio is sometimes a footpath, a horse
track, a Roman street and now, a gravel road that winds through
peaks and valleys dotted with tiny farms and fortresslike
monasteries where 13th-century travelers could spend the night. It
is called the Sentiero Francescano della Pace because it is the
path that Francesco di Bernardone _ better known as St. Francis _
is believed to have taken after he stood naked in Assisi's central
piazza, renounced family and friends and set out on the journey
that effectively defined the rest of his life as wanderer, seeker,
ultimately saint. What is it in a life that leads a medieval
playboy to sainthood, and where does the path begin? That's what
Gretel Ehrlich wondered 800 years later as she stepped onto the
Sentiero and followed Francesco's footsteps out of Assisi.

   &UR; POPE CELESTINE V WAS AN UNWILLING HOLY MAN
 &UR; (500 words)
 &UR; By A.N. Wilson
</P>
<P>
   Celestine V, the only pope in history to have resigned, is the
millennium's best pontiff, according to the author A.N. Wilson. The
85-year-old peasant mystic was elected in 1294, at a time when the
papal throne had been empty for two years, thanks to infighting by
the Mafia-style bosses who ran the medieval church. He resigned
five months later. Dante placed him in Hell for his gran rifuito,
his abdication. But this was an unwilling holy man who knew there
was no meeting place between the pursuit of power and the worship
of God.

   &UR; `CITY ON A HILL' SERMON OFFERED THE BIBLE AS CIVIC BLUEPRINT
 &UR; (1,500 words)
 &UR; By PETER J. GOMES
</P>
<P>
   The definitive sermon of the last 1,000 years was delivered in
1630 when the layman Robert Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, preached to his fellow immigrants while still at sea
aboard the ship Arbella. ``Christian Charity: A Model Hereof,'' is
what Winthrop called his sermon, and it would have languished in
obscurity were it not for its felicitous use of a biblical image _
that of the ``city set on a hill'' _ to describe the moral purpose
of the Pilgrims' adventure into the unknown. That image, familiar
to generations of Christians from Jesus' ``Sermon on the Mount'' in
Matthew's gospel, is what gave Winthrop's sermon life. And it
provided perhaps the most enduring metaphor of the American
experience, that of the exemplary nation _ the ``city on a hill''

   &UR; SEEKING CONTEMPLATION.COM, AWAY FROM THE ALL-SURROUNDING BUZZ

</P>
<P>
   The fact that we can get a connection to anywhere today, almost
instantly, means that we can be got anywhere, all the time. And the
fact that friends and bosses can find us so easily means that it is
ever more difficult to get lost amid the beepers, cell phones and
modems. But at a Benedictine hermitage 1,300 feet above the Pacific
Ocean on the California coast, tolling bells mark out a centered

   Has there been in the last thousand years a single best time to
be alive? In this age of faith in progress, it's easy to answer
quickly: Yes, right now. But does that response stand up to
informed comparison with past times? How about the Ming Dynasty? Or
Puritan New England? To answer this tantalizing question,

   The most important idea of this millennium was set in motion by
a man named Abu Ali al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, born around the year

   No doubt, the printing press is one of the greatest inventions
in history. Just think of its enormous consequences. Without
printing, millions of people wouldn't have read Martin Luther's 95
Theses, the Declaration of Independence, the Communist Manifesto or
other world-changing texts. Without printing, we wouldn't have
modern science. But Johannes Gutenberg does not deserve sole credit
for inventing it. He reinvented a technique previously developed in
Minoan Crete around 1700 B.C., if not long before that.

 &UR; By JOYCE CAROL OATES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world has come to mean, in the popular
imagination, romantic love almost exclusively. But it may come as a
surprise to learn that the very concept of ``love'' based on
emotion as a high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is
relatively new in the history of mankind. In the ancient world,
romantic love would seem to have been virtually unknown, and rarely
celebrated. Our generic term ``love'' didn't exist. The sentiment
of romantic love as we know it was the homoerotic love of older
Greek men for boys. Marital love, which surely existed, seems oddly
not to have been much honored, at least in surviving literature.

   &UR; `EVERY DICTATOR'S NIGHTMARE'
 &UR; (2,200 words)
 &UR; By WOLE SOYINKA
</P>
<P>
   The message, whether from Yoruban elders or the Founding
Fathers, the Bible or the Koran, is the same: Certain fundamental
rights are inherent to all humanity. It is a noble idea that has
spread by its own power in this millennium and has now begun to
flourish.

   &UR; THE MOST COMPELLING REVOLUTION OF OUR TIME
 &UR; By ALAN BRINKLEY
 &UR; (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the peacemaker, India won its
freedom without firing a shot. He has been mythologized since his
assassination in 1948, but he deserves his position as a symbol of
one of the most important phenomena of modern history: the
simultaneous assault on colonialism and on the oppression of
individuals, which has transformed much of the 20th-century world.

   &UR; THE BEST TREATY OF THE MILLENNIUM
 &UR; (600 words)
 &UR; By FAREED ZAKARIA
</P>
<P>
   Some treaties mark the birth of whole new concepts of
international relations. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 brought an
end to the Thirty Years' War, the deadliest conflict in history
until then, in which perhaps 10 million people died. It also
ushered in the modern state system that governs our world _ the
very system that is now, 350 years later, being undermined by
transnational forces like the euro, the Internet and Amnesty
International.

<P>
   &UR; MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE OF THE MILLENNIUM
 &UR; (800 WORDS)
 &UR; By R.W. APPLE JR.
</P>
<P>
   Much was at stake when Burgoyne rolled the dice and lost the
Battle of Saratoga. As a result, France entered the war on the
American side and Washington and his ragtag army at Valley Forge
saw the road to ultimate victory. The millennium would see other
great battles, such as Gettysburg and D-Day. But in the last 1,000
years, I think, only the defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near
Vienna in 1683 rivaled Saratoga. It turned back the tide of Islam.
Saratoga did more. It launched two centuries of revolution
elsewhere. It marked the beginning of the end of the British
Empire. And it breathed life into the United States of America.

<P>
   &UR; WHO WAS THE BEST LEADER OF THE MILLENNIUM?
 &UR; (500 Words)
 &UR; BY GAIL COLLINS
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look how well she governs,'' the once-reluctant subjects
of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, later would remark. For the
ravishing ruler exceeded all expectations, and by now she is
namesake to an era.

   &UR; BEST RANDOM SHOT IN HISTORY?
 &UR; (500 words)
 &UR; By CHARLES McGRATH
</P>
<P>
   A nameless bowman in the forests of Normandy took a random shot
and from 100 yards pierced the right eye of King Harold of England.
It was during the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and that arrow in the
eye changed the English language.

   &UR; THE BEST UTOPIA
 &UR; (700 words)
 &UR; By MARGARET ATWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Every time we try to implement ``utopia'' on a grand scale, we
accomplish its disastrous opposite. Perhaps that is why the word
itself means ``no place.'' The best utopia of the last thousand
years may well have been built by the Shakers, a breakaway group of
Quakers who went to America in 1774 under the leadership of
``Mother'' Ann Lee. They were a kindly, melodious and harmless
bunch. They were pacifists; they didn't try to impose their ideas
by force. They made a lasting contribution to furniture design and
music, which is more than some can say, and best of all, they were
self-limiting.

   &UR; MOST IMPORTANT BATTLE OF THE MILLENNIUM
 &UR; (800 WORDS)
 &UR; By R.W. APPLE JR.
</P>
<P>
   Much was at stake when Burgoyne rolled the dice and lost the
Battle of Saratoga. As a result, France entered the war on the
American side and Washington and his ragtag army at Valley Forge
saw the road to ultimate victory. The millennium would see other
great battles, such as Gettysburg and D-Day. But in the last 1,000
years, I think, only the defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near
Vienna in 1683 rivaled Saratoga. It turned back the tide of Islam.
Saratoga did more. It launched two centuries of revolution
elsewhere. It marked the beginning of the end of the British
Empire. And it breathed life into the United States of America.

   &UR; WHO WAS THE BEST LEADER OF THE MILLENNIUM?
 &UR; (500 Words)
 &UR; BY GAIL COLLINS
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look how well she governs,'' the once-reluctant subjects
of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, later would remark. For the
ravishing ruler exceeded all expectations, and by now she is
namesake to an era.

   &UR; BEST RANDOM SHOT IN HISTORY?
 &UR; (500 words)
 &UR; By CHARLES McGRATH
</P>
<P>
   A nameless bowman in the forests of Normandy took a random shot
and from 100 yards pierced the right eye of King Harold of England.
It was during the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and that arrow in the
eye changed the English language.

   &UR; THE BEST UTOPIA
 &UR; (700 words)
 &UR; By MARGARET ATWOOD
</P>
<P>
   Every time we try to implement ``utopia'' on a grand scale, we
accomplish its disastrous opposite. Perhaps that is why the word
itself means ``no place.'' The best utopia of the last thousand
years may well have been built by the Shakers, a breakaway group of
Quakers who went to America in 1774 under the leadership of
``Mother'' Ann Lee. They were a kindly, melodious and harmless
bunch. They were pacifists; they didn't try to impose their ideas
by force. They made a lasting contribution to furniture design and
music, which is more than some can say, and best of all, they were
self-limiting.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1969, when police raided the Stonewall Inn in New
York's Greenwich Village, its gay patrons believed they were
harassed because of their lifestyle and vowed not to let it happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   It was a watershed event that helped to politicize gays and
lesbians around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Boston will soon be the site of another defining moment
in gay and lesbian history: Stonewall Communities, a retirement
community like no other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project will give gays and lesbians one of the first
visionary models for a community that draws on the best in
retirement thinking done to this point, and tailors it to us,''
said Janet Stambolian, 51, director of a design and construction
company in Burlington, Vt., and one of the organizers of the new
community.
</P>
<P>
   But although the ideas animating this community may be radical,
it is not intended as a home for radicals, or necessarily even for
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also want to evoke the comfort and practicality of a good
New England stone wall,'' said David Aronstein, 47, of Boston, a
social worker and managing partner in the new venture, which
organizers hope will provide 70 to 100 ``gay-friendly'' units in
about four years in the heart of downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers move into old age, a growing number of elders,
including gays and lesbians, are looking to have their housing
needs met. This construction project reflects one of the biggest
changes in the gay and lesbian community, which is becoming more
confident and more demanding in asserting its needs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census Bureau and the Human Rights Campaign, a
gay rights group in Washington, D.C., the number of people who are
openly gay and over 65 will jump from at least 1.6 million to 3.5
million in the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   While gay seniors in the past often felt they had to keep their
sexual preferences hidden, the generation that followed them has
experienced more social approval and ``a more tribal lifestyle,''
said John Goode, 47, a real estate agent for Hunneman-Coldwell
Banker in the South End and another managing partner in the
Stonewall venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are redefining everything, including what it
means to retire,'' Goode said. ``We're out to change the
paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for instance, say goodbye to the notion that retirement
communities should be situated in placid, pastoral areas in the
balmy South or Southwest. These organizers think that living in a
city like Boston, with its vibrant cultural opportunities and urban
conveniences, can help to keep a person young. They don't want to
be cut off from supportive friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bond together more than other people because of the things
we've had to go up against,'' Goode said. ``To keep those bonds
strong as we get older, that's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and others stressed that Stonewall Communities will not
be limited exclusively to gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us have spent our lifetimes fighting discrimination,''
Aronstein said. ``We don't want to start doing it ourselves now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to build a fortress,'' he continued. ``We want
to create a special residential community that's integrated into
its neighborhood, as well as the gay and lesbian community. We want
to encourage diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike many retirement homes and assisted living facilities,
the Stonewall Communities will be a place where people will choose
to live because it offers opportunities for privacy or for
socializing, a complex of shops and services and homes where the
young-old can go and happily ``age in place,'' Aronstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is still in the research phase, so exactly what it
will look like, where it will be located, and how it will be
financed have not yet been determined. But organizers foresee 70 to
100 units, priced for middle and upper-middle income homeowners,
most over 55 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Aronstein said, Stonewall Communities may include:
</P>
<P>
   --A small-business center, with shared office support machines
and services.
</P>
<P>
   --A public day care center, to encourage interaction between
generations.
</P>
<P>
   --A health club with exercise and nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   --A community center, including a small auditorium or theater.
</P>
<P>
   --A restaurant, for public and private dining.
</P>
<P>
   --A rooftop garden.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be services not provided at traditional
retirement homes, such as a tool and carpentry shop for women as
well as men.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the development grew out of a survey done in
conjunction with Gerontological Services, Inc., and sent to 3,600
gays and lesbians, age 40 and older, in the six New England states
and upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 328 who responded, 86 percent said they would like to
live in a gay and lesbian environment as they age. Some had heard
stories about harassment of homosexuals at places like Sun City,
Ariz., and some senior housing facilities in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But more were focused on building a community of people who
could age together, openly and creatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for a community that's hard to find,
particularly as they get older,'' Aronstein said. ``They don't want
a retirement home or a leisure resort. They want to redefine what
it means to retire.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Boston College senior Patrick Hess walks the
labyrinth with his bare feet, the sensation of the cold earth
beneath him adding to ``the most intense'' prayer he's ever
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Taylor, a junior, has sought out the labyrinth in times of
stress, ``to put things in perspective.'' Graduate student Arwen
Lietz once romped through it at a stormy midnight hour, splashing
through puddles, delighting in her solitude in the black of night.
</P>
<P>
   By walking, dancing, or even crawling through BC's labyrinth,
these students have joined a spiritual movement that is just
catching fire in the United States, even as it harks back to the
practices of religious pilgrims in medieval Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The campus labyrinth, a circle 50 feet in diameter that encloses
a 28-loop path of 300 yards, is based on the labyrinth at Chartres
Cathedral in France and is sponsored by the French honor society Pi
Delta Phi.
</P>
<P>
   But the labyrinth's appeal is much broader. Students say they
find it a peaceful escape during a frenzied time of life when
studying and socializing often leave no room for quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   A 4,000- to 5,000-year-old concept, the labyrinth today is a
sensation once again. Enthusiasts say its popularity lies in its
ability to create sanctuary amidst the chaos of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to buy a ``finger labyrinth'' _ to be traced with
a finger _ or to sign up for a weekend labyrinth workshop. Prisons
and hospitals have used them, and it has been estimated that 1,000
labyrinths have been constructed in the 1990s in Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College first built a labyrinth last fall, drawing
hundreds of visitors from campus and beyond, according to Pi Delta
Phi's president, Timothy Sullivan, a senior who coordinated the
project along with Romance languages professor Rebecca Valette.
</P>
<P>
   The simple formation of painted lines on the grass _ the same
method used to mark boundaries on a football field _ is back this
month, and will be repainted as necessary every few weeks until the
first snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   A vehicle for meditation is sorely needed on a college campus,
said Sullivan, whose field is art history and French studies.
Sullivan spent his summer doing historical research on labyrinths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life as a college student can be very hectic and stressful,
and that's precisely why the labyrinth holds such an attraction,''
Sullivan said. ``We always have assignments to do and theses to
write and graduate applications to send in. Students want and need
to calm themselves down.''
</P>
<P>
   Labyrinths were a common feature in ancient cultures, say people
who have studied them. Ancient Scandinavian fishermen, for example,
constructed labyrinths on the beach to trap evil spirits and ensure
a safe journey, according to the Reverend Bruce Morrill of Boston
College, who wrote a chapter on labyrinths for a forthcoming book
called ``Bodies of Worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite popular usage, the word labyrinth does not necessarily
describe a maze, though in the Greek myth the hero Theseus needed
Ariadne's string to wind his way out of the labyrinth in Crete
after killing the Minotaur. Many may also remember the 1986 Jim
Henson movie ``Labyrinth,'' in which a young girl navigates a vast
maze of monsters to save her baby brother from the goblin king
played by David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic labyrinth, however, there exists one path in and
out, a design meant to calm, rather than confuse, the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Labyrinths built more recently in the United States are usually
modeled after those that drew European pilgrims in the Middle Ages.
Most Christians could not make the costly and dangerous pilgrimage
to Jerusalem. Instead, they made pilgrimages to shrines and
cathedrals, some of which, like Chartres (built around 1230),
housed labyrinths.
</P>
<P>
   One name for the labyrinth at Chartres, according to Sullivan,
was ``le chemin de Jerusalem,'' or ``the road to Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Patti Keeler of Harwich, Mass., a certified holistic nurse who
runs several labyrinth seminars each month, called the labyrinth
``a tool whose time is due.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's steeped in ritual and in antiquity, yet it's a wonderful
modern tool to bring us back to our own center and to God,'' said
Keeler, who called her first labyrinth a life-changing experience.
</P>
<P>
   Moving through a labyrinth brings mind and body together in a
way that few other forms of prayer or meditation can, Keeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a body prayer,'' she said. ``It serves as a metaphor for
whatever you're going through. As you move through it, knowing
you'll get to the center and that there's only one path to take, it
allows for other forms of consciousness to bubble forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has at least a dozen public and private labyrinths
at parks, churches, and even a retail shop, Annie's Garden and Gift
Store in Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors enter a labyrinth with a particular vexing
question in mind, some repeat a mantra, and others simply enjoy the
walk. The process appeals to seemingly unlikely enthusiasts. Keeler
said her daughter's entire high school basketball team made a trip
to a local labyrinth before every game last year. Prison inmates
and those in wheelchairs have even made use of finger labyrinths,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, 21, returned to the campus labyrinth on Tuesday after
several visits last fall. As he prepared to kick off his flip-flops
and let his feet touch the grass in the chilly dusk, Hess said he
has found the experience gives him spiritual clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of walking step by step, conscious of every breath,
helped me think a lot more about being present in the moment,
instead of living my life caught up in the future or the past,''
Hess said. ``It's good to remember that before you can take the
second step, you have to take the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Taylor, 20, pointed out that the labyrinth reminds students
that life has meaning beyond Wednesday's midterm or Friday's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something higher than schoolwork, believe it or
not,'' she said.

DEMOCRATIC CYNICISM ON NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton (ital) Wanted (un-ital) To Lose the Test-Ban
Treaty Vote,'' editorializes the New York Post. A daft idea? The
Post marshals the evidence:
</P>
<P>
   The president never called the Senate majority leader in the
months before the vote to urge ratification of the treaty. The vice
president never mounted a campaign to build public support for it.
Top administration officials never urged Senate Republicans to
bring the treaty _ which was signed three years ago _ to the floor.
Indeed, in a strategy session with Senate Democrats on Sept. 23,
national security adviser Sandy Berger schemed to embarrass
Republicans in the upcoming campaign by chiding them for (ital) not
(un-ital) having put it to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   At times the cynicism was undisguised. When Senator William Roth
of Delaware, a Republican, announced his opposition to the treaty,
Joseph Biden, the Delaware Democrat, exclaimed: ``Bingo! That's
$200,000 worth of ads.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Democrats, with some honorable exceptions, the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was worth more dead than alive.
Campaigning in Seattle when the Senate voted, Al Gore was so keen
to denounce the GOP that he taped a TV ad on the spot. The treaty's
``breathtakingly irresponsible'' defeat, he told reporters, was the
fault of ``right-wing extremists.'' A fuming Clinton, meanwhile,
was blasting the Republicans for their ``reckless partisanship''
and ``neo-isolationism.'' Thanks to the Senate, he said, we now
have ``no other means of keeping countries around the world from
developing nuclear arsenals and threatening our security.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical was ABC correspondent Martha Raddatz's analysis of the
vote. ``I think what it showed is they'' _ the Republicans _
``don't really care about the world at all.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new here. It was in just such hysterical
cadences that Ronald Reagan was savaged in the 1980s as he set
about repairing the nation's degraded defenses and confronting the
Soviet threat. It was in such cadences that Edward Kennedy and his
allies condemned those who didn't join their ``nuclear freeze''
campaign a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Reagan succeeded and the nuclear freeze did not.
The result was that when Reagan left office, the world was a safer
place, and the United States a more secure nation, than either had
been eight years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But on Bill Clinton's watch, the world has grown steadily more
dangerous. In crisis after crisis, region after region, the Clinton
administration's record is one of debacle, weakness, and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Stick a pin almost anywhere on the map and see the bitter fruit
of Clinton's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq? Saddam Hussein thumbs his nose at the world, Clinton's
occasional pinprick attacks having dissuaded him not at all from
his drive to build an arsenal of mass destruction. The UN weapons
inspectors are long gone, driven out by Saddam when it became clear
that Washington _ at least under the Clinton administration _ would
do nothing to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia? For years the administration dithered, unwilling to take
the lead in stopping Slobodan Milosevic's brigands from
slaughtering their way to a Greater Serbia. When Clinton finally
did act, it was to midwife a Dayton agreement that kept Milosevic
in power _ and free to unleash a new bloodbath in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   China? In exchange for campaign cash from Beijing, the Clinton
White House was opened to Chinese operatives. In exchange for
campaign cash from Silicon Valley, the administration approved
sales of sensitive satellite technology to China. For more than six
years, Clinton and Gore have refused to rock any boat that might
jeopardize the access of American business to Chinese markets. They
looked the other way when China proliferated nuclear weapons
material to Pakistan and Iran, refused to take action when Chinese
spies stole military secrets from US nuclear laboratories, and
declined to reassure Taiwan that it can count on US support if it
is attacked or invaded by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, on the subcontinent, in Indonesia, in Russia, in
Rwanda, in Somalia _ around the world these past seven years,
America has been timid when it should have been decisive, clueless
when it should have been informed, careless when it should have
been vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would have made this bad
resume &UR;  &LR; even worse. Unverifiable and unreliable, it would have done
little to stop the spread of nuclear weapons but a good deal to
weaken the US nuclear umbrella that shelters much of the free
world. That is why it was opposed by a phalanx of former defense
secretaries, national security advisers, and CIA directors, and
that is why the Republicans killed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reckless partisanship''? ``Neo-isolationism''? ``Right-wing
extremists''? In a way it is comical to see Clinton and Gore hurl
such epithets at the likes of Richard Lugar, John McCain, Olympia
Snowe, and Pete Domenici, GOP senators renowned for their
international outlook and bipartisan instincts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing funny about the president and vice
president _ and many members of their party _ playing politics so
nakedly and dishonestly with so grave an issue. Gore and the
Democrats promise to make the test ban treaty an issue in the
political year ahead. Let them. They may find that the American
public is not half so gullible as they imagine.

   &UR; THE DRAWBACKS OF `UNSEXING' THE LANGUAGE
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By WILLIAM SAFIRE
</P>
<P>
   In wiping away the undoubted masculine tilt to a thousand years
of English, and in attempting to imbue our language with gender
equality, are we going too far too fast? Contrariwise, in making
our language reflect a belated sense of fairness, should we tell
tradition-bound male chauvinists, ``Sorry, buddy, but you can't
make an omelet without breaking eggs''? (Or contra-contrariwise,
should we use an egg metaphor at all in this discussion?)

   &UR; A MEMORABLE SPEECH EXTOLLED A FRIEND, `FAITHFUL EVEN IN DEATH'
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By WILLIAM SAFIRE
</P>
<P>
   There have been many ``great'' speeches on momentous occasions:
Patrick Henry's ``Give me liberty or give me death!'' Or Lincoln's
``Four score and seven years ago ...'' Or even Robert Emmet's
gallows speech, ``Let no man write my epitaph!'' But there were
also some shorter remarks made by lesser-known figures that sparkle
in the sands of our time. William Safire casts an appreciative nod
toward George Graham Vest, who, as a young lawyer, made ``a
sentimental little speech that is the best I can find of its
kind.'' It was a tribute to a dog.

   &UR; REFLECTING ON THE FALL AND RISE OF `SELF'
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By WILLIAM SAFIRE
</P>
<P>
   ``Self'' used to be a dirty word. ``I celebrate myself,'' Walt
Whitman sang in his ''Song of Myself.'' Since then, however, the
notion of self as something to be celebrated has been taking a
beating. We think it is bad to be selfish, good to be selfless. And
yet, ``self'' is making a comeback. Showing some self-confidence,
it has even become the name of a Conde Nast magazine aimed at women
interested in their own bodies and minds.

   &UR; REBIRTH AND REDEMPTION FOR SOME BATTERED WORDS
 &UR; (1,000 words)
 &UR; By WILLIAM SAFIRE
</P>
<P>
   The word ``adventurer'' has had a wild ride through the
millennium. Not that long ago ``adventurer'' meant a brawler, a
plunderer, and even the Devil himself. But today, an adventurer is
no longer a person to be feared. The word has reasserted the
romantic, courageous quality that the poet Keats once gave it.
Meanwhile, ``hellmouth'' is an archaic word that has returned to
vogue as a result of a popular TV series.

WEAPONS THAT KEEP ON KILLING BOTH SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marcus and Atsuko spent the summer with my friend Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   They came to Marblehead after spending the winter traveling from
Auschwitz to Hiroshima on a peace walk to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of World War II. They spoke so passionately about the
spiritual benefits they'd gained that Lynn and I were inspired to
accompany them on a Walk for Peace that began at Starmet Corp. in
Concord, Mass., and ended _ on the anniversary of the bombing of
Nagasaki _ with the arrest of five of the peace walkers at Raytheon
Corp. in North Andover, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   The sun was shining as Lynn and I stood by the side of the road,
practicing the Buddhist chant Marcus and Atsuko were leading: ``Nam
Myoho Renge Kyo.'' I beat out the rhythm on a drum I carried, as
about a dozen of us stretched out along a route chosen to dramatize
the fact that these two firms have been helping our government wage
a ``radioactive'' war against the people of Iraq and Yugoslavia,
using munitions made with depleted uranium. DU, a byproduct of
uranium enrichment, burns and oxidizes upon impact, creating
radioactive particles that are easily inhaled and ingested. These
can cross the placenta, enter semen and breast milk, and cause
cancer and leukemia as well as chromosome and immune system damage
for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   Since DU has a radioactive half life of 4.5 billion years, we're
now waging wars that will last for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   As our group walked and chanted, I had time to brood about the
consequences of deciding to use such potent weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Arbuthnot, a London-based journalist who won a British
award for her coverage of Iraq, reported from Basra after the war
that ``cancer, leukemias, and malignancies have risen up to 70
percent since the Gulf War, increases linked to the depleted
uranium weapons used primarily by the US and UK, leaving a
radioactive dust throughout the country, which according to experts
has entered the food chain via the water table and the soil. . . .
One doctor's thesis compares abnormalities since the Gulf War with
Hiroshima. Dr. Jenan Ali's photographs for 1998 show full-term
babies . . . reminiscent of the Pacific Islands after the 1950s
nuclear testing. Others _ no face, no eyes, twisted limbs, no
limbs, no brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This would a terrible enough consequence if it only affected the
children of our enemies, but it is also mirrored in the plight of
the sons and daughters born to some of our own returning Gulf
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Life magazine ran an article titled ``Tiny
Victims of Desert Storm,'' which raised the possibility that DU was
implicated in these American youngsters' otherwise baffling
deformities. For those who had the heart to look, there were photos
of the children of American soldiers, some with no arms, no legs,
or misplaced inner organs, some without thyroids, with two hearts
or hearts on the wrong side, enlarged heads and abdomens, and
abnormal blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   We have reached the point where our weapons, in their awesome
power, make no distinction between combatant and bystander, victor
and vanquished, or soldier and offspring. In seeking to destroy
others at any cost, we are placing ourselves directly in harm's
way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Starmet Corp., whose armor-piercing DU bullets are
designed to inflict pain on an enemy, has contaminated ground water
on its own property in Concord with concentrations of uranium up to
3000 times what are now considered safe levels. We've not only
turned battlefields in Iraq into killing fields for countless
generations, we're poisoning our own future.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked, I wondered. Why didn't we reconsider what we were
doing to ourselves after aboveground nuclear tests showered deadly
radioactivity upon our own citizens? Why won't we acknowledge that
the pesticides we are using in our war against insects are damaging
our own cells? What will it take to teach us that as long as all
living things share this one tiny interrelated biosphere, the more
powerful our weapons, the more likely we will become the victims of
our own hostility?
</P>
<P>
   I took one step after another, lost in the rhythm of the chant.
Walking seemed such a slow process that I was surprised to find I'd
already gone 5 miles. One small step after another. One painful
lesson after another. One moment of understanding after another.
</P>
<P>
   Someday soon we will have to give up hating our enemies in order
to save ourselves.

AIR FORCE TURNS TO CYBERSPACE TO BOOST RECRUITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Struggling to recover from a record-setting
recruiting tailspin, the Air Force has launched a retooled Internet
site that sports a 3-D view of jets and an arcade of video games.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned site (www.airforce.com) was activated this week
and uses high-tech advances to showcase Air Force offerings as the
service tries to strengthen its recruiting effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The innovative artistic design and increased functionality of
the Web site allows users the choice to link to `microsites'
focusing on career and educational opportunities provided by the
Air Force,'' said Tech. Sgt. Charles T. Marshall, one of the
designers of the site. ``The level of sophistication involved in
this site is more of what one would expect from a CD-ROM rather
than the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a series of new, fast-paced television spots that recently
aired in major television markets, the Web site comes with bells
and whistles the Air Force hopes will spark the interest of
computer-literate young people, said Master Sgt. Tom Clements, a
spokesman with the Air Force Recruiting Service in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we're trying to do,'' he said Wednesday. ``We are
looking for the young people who are technically savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   A disappointing recruiting year is behind the marketing efforts,
Clements conceded, and ``greatly increased and enhanced'' the
service's turn to the Internet, which is seen as a key area for
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The service fell 1,734 enlistees short of its goal in the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30, making it the Air Force's worst recruiting
year since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As the Army pondered changing its time-honored slogan, ``Be all
that you can be,'' and last month lured new soldiers with a $6,000
bonus in hopes of trimming a shortfall of its own, the Air Force
spent millions to air several slick Hollywood-produced television
spots as part of its first paid advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The same Dallas company that handled the advertising campaign,
BJK&AMP;E, also designed www.airforce.com, Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site includes links to the three television spots, and
tries to draw the attention of Web surfers by displaying old
fighters, bombers and experimental planes, as well as the latest in
high-tech hardware.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web site sections include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Boneyard,'' featuring older aircraft and a fact sheet with
information about the size, speed and armament of now-discarded
aircraft, as well as how they were used in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hangar,'' a section on the present-day Air Force, offering
what the service called ``vivid displays'' of today's jet aircraft.
Each month a plane will be featured with a 3-D view, a video, photo
gallery and an analysis, plus facts and figures on the aircraft's
size, speed and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Flight Plan,'' which introduces visitors to the careers of
current Air Force members and invites them to complete a
questionnaire on their hobbies, achievements, educational plans and
goals. Users also are encouraged to take the completed
questionnaire to recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the site are devoted to life in the Air Force,
technology now in use, screensavers and three video games, one in
which the player ``flies'' an F-15 combat mission against a
fictitious enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see something this high-tech representing the
Air Force,'' Clements said. ``We've always been known as the
high-tech branch of the military.''

DID RED SOX HAVE A DATE WITH DESTINY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is ``The Secret Language of Destiny,'' a just-published
tome, 824 pages, and at $34.95 for 4 pounds 14 ounces, worth its
weight in good, if not great, chocolate, and almost as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Goldschneider, the astrology columnist for Mirabella
magazine, and co-author Joost Elffers, have devised a system they
call ``personology,'' which outlines the karmic path each of us is
destined to undertake and reveals our (drumroll, please) Destiny.
Mine is the Way of Study, which came as a surprise, but my specific
personal karma seemed familiar, ``wacky, distracted . . . likes to
be left alone . . . pessimism . . . self-doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Could there be something to personology? I checked out a few
friends and family members. Some descriptions were uncanny, my
husband's for example. It begins, ``Simple stubbornness may be the
biggest pitfall.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, we've heard so much talk about Destiny, Fate,
Fortune, Karma both good and bad. Could personology be applied to
the Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   First, soon-to-be-manager-of-the-year, Jimy Williams. Born Oct.
4, 1943. His karmic path is the Way of Resolve. His greatest
challenge: ``Not floundering in the sea of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more. The self-effacing Williams is one of those who
``tend not to take their own needs seriously.'' They must find
their karmic fulfillment in ``clarifying who they are and what they
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He must be well along his karmic pathway after Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, clutch-hitting but error-prone third baseman John
Valentin, born Feb. 18, 1967. His karmic path is the Way of
Satisfaction. His profile begins, ``The individual born in this
week may find life a bit difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. The greatest challenge for Valentin and his karmic
ilk? ``Getting a grip on their insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in his case, maybe just getting a grip on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the incomparable Pedro Martinez. His karmic path is the
Way of Freedom. ``Brilliant and creative in the extreme,'' his
profile begins, ``. . . a rare combination of strong mental
orientation together with an equal measure of passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is second baseman Jose Offerman, born Nov. 11, 1968, with a
bat, if not a glove, in his hand. His karmic path is the Way of
Wonder. The biggest challenge for Offerman and those born the same
week? ``Slacking off on their intensity level.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Just when personology is starting to look like an exact science
I see that Nomar Garciaparra, born July 23, 1973, and Monica
Lewinsky share a karmic profile. How can this be? Theirs is the Way
of Consolidation. Their biggest challenge? ``Developing a safety
valve they can use when their moods overwhelm them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that explains Nomar's fidgeting.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to know which karmic path the Red Sox
are on as a team. I'd guess it's the Way of Transcendence, ``The
destiny of those born to this karmic path is to learn how to
transcend limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fans could improve the Sox karma by ceasing to endlessly
revisit that fateful moment in the sixth game of the 1986 World
Series. Speaking of which, Bill Buckner was born Dec. 14, 1949, on
the Way of Individuation. The biggest challenge of those on this
karmic path is ``off-loading enough of their responsibilities to
allow for some self-exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   He just happened to off-load at the wrong moment. But that's

SUCCESS CHASES JACI VELASQUEZ 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Pop stars rarely make their own phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   If there are digits to be dialed for an interview, the task is
usually taken care of by an agent, a publicist, a manager. We
wouldn't want our fragile singer breaking a nail, would we?
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary Christian superstar Jaci Velasquez is a little
different. Her call for a last-minute interview was indeed made by
someone else, but it wasn't some slick record exec or overeager
yes-man. And she had a legitimate excuse for not making the call
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just trying to connect you with my daughter,'' said Diana
Velasquez, calling from her home in Nashville, Tenn. ``We just got
in from a trip from Guam, so we're both like half-dead. We're
trying to make coffee to wake up. Jaci goes, `Mom, get him on the
phone.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Jaci Velasquez takes the phone from her mother, she seems
wide awake, despite just coming down from a whirlwind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just woke up, but I'm not like completely messed up, which
is really good'' said the performer.
</P>
<P>
   If Velasquez had been a little disoriented, we wouldn't have
held it against her. Her 3 1/2-day trip to Guam included two
concerts and a special performance for the governor's birthday
party. It also had resulted in some unexpected side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got over the time change. My head is just gone; I'm so
messed up,'' Velasquez said. ``I felt so bad for those poor people.
They probably thought, `This girl always has bags under her eyes.'
I looked tired. And I haven't adjusted to the time here yet, so
it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides crooning for other people's birthdays, Velasquez found
time in between appearances in Guam to celebrate her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big 2-0,'' she said with mock enthusiasm. ``I would
definitely have to say this birthday feels different from the rest.
I feel a little weird saying (I'm 20). It's kinda scary. It's like
a milestone. There's no excuse for all my mess-ups now.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at Velasquez's track record, however, indicates
no glaring missteps so far. After singing in church and with her
parents, the Houston-born singer was asked to open a concert for
Christian-pop outfit Point of Grace. The group's manager was so
impressed with her that he referred her to Myrrh Records.
</P>
<P>
   After some serious discussion, Velasquez signed to the label at
age 15 and released her first album, ``Heavenly Place,'' in 1996.
It was certified gold and stands as the fastest-selling debut album
for a solo artist in Christian music history.
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez's self-titled second album was released in 1998 and
also was certified gold for sales in excess of 500,000 copies.
Throw in a slew of Dove awards, eight No. 1 singles and ``A
Heavenly Place,'' her inspirational book aimed at teens, and she
seems poised for a long and prosperous career.
</P>
<P>
   She says that so much success was an unexpected result of a
simple love for singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know or think that any of those things would
happen,'' Velasquez said. ``You grow up, and you think, `Maybe I'll
be a doctor one day or an astronaut.' I was still doing that. I
never had a chance to go, `Maybe I'll be a singer.' It was an
exciting thing happening _ unfolding in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez's expressive, crystal-clear voice is reaching even
more ears with the recent release of ``Llegar a Ti,'' her first
album of all Spanish-language tunes. It's a perfect showcase for
her burgeoning talents, blending positive messages, dreamy ballads
and salsa-tinged up-tempo numbers. The album's title track is
already No. 2 on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks list, primed to
dethrone Marc Anthony from the top position.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Spanish) wasn't my first language, but my dad would always
teach me Spanish hymns, and I'd have to sing them in church,'' she
said. ``I knew that I loved to sing in Spanish because it's such an
emotional and a passionate language.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her successful cross-over onto the Spanish pop charts
and radio, Velasquez made sure her messages of faith and hope were
retained in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really important to me to be able to relate to the
songs that I sang,'' Velasquez said. ``I can't relate to, `Hey
baby, come on over here.' I can relate to the love I have for my
family, the love I have for God and the love one day I will have
from a guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that responsibility to those little girls who look up
to me and who listen to my music. I feel the responsibility to
their parents, as well, that they know when they buy my CDs that
it's something that their kids can listen to all the time and never
get the wrong idea about life.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are reassuring words from a young artist whose pop-music
contemporaries regularly indulge in come-hither pouts and
show-business excesses. For Velasquez, though, it's simply part of
being true to herself and making time for everyday pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's so important to have that balance in your life,
and I do have friends,'' Velasquez said. ``I really have a great
family that keeps me balanced, and they keep me pretty accountable.
People know me from the get-go. They know what I do, and they have
to like me with or without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night I went out with a friend to go drink coffee. And I
have, like, a special guy who's really cool. I make time for
life.''

BOLD `WITCH' SCARES WITH ITS STORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT'
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Artisan, CC, VHS $22.98, DVD $29.98
</P>
<P>
   ust three months ago, a bold little film entered a forest of
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after $139 million at the box office, countless parodies, a
barrage of backlash and an absurdly short ``wait,'' its footage
will be found in video stores starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Is this ``Witch'' worth the fuss? Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, because it dares to scare by appealing to the imagination,
not gorging on gore or special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, because this cheap yet realistic look at film students
tracking a witchy legend in the woods, getting lost and never
returning struck a major chord with viewers weary of film artifice
and spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   No, because for all its effectiveness, ``Blair Witch'' doesn't
come close to the best modern horror films, from ``The Exorcist''
to ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, because ``Blair Witch'' isn't truly original so much as
lightning that struck at the right time _ and was backed by a
wildly effective marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is ``Blair Witch'' for all tastes. Its jerky camera
movements made some people nauseous in theaters (although they're
easier to take on a TV screen), and its documentary feel is far
from today's state-of-the-art filmmaking, even for low-budget
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But at least ``Blair Witch'' shows _ as if the lesson were
needed _ that good films don't require big stars and big budgets.
Strong, well-told stories will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   (Also on video _ for $14.98 _ is ``Curse of the Blair Witch,''
the pseudo-documentary TV special about the pseudo-documentary
movie. You also can catch exclusive new footage from ``The Blair
Witch Project'' shoot at www.amazon.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.

<P>
   1999, R, Paramount, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.99
</P>
<P>
   And Matthew Broderick thought Godzilla was a monster? He'd never
met Tracy Flick.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) is a baldly ambitious girl campaigning
for student-body president at the high school where Jim McAllister
(Broderick) is a science teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Jim sees through Tracy's school-spirit facade and into her heart
of darkness. She's amoral and mean and would do anything to get
ahead. He must nip this power-hungry flower in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   Their war of wills and dirty tricks serves a delicious black
comedy that's awash in a sea of grays.
</P>

   Rating: 3 stars.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Dimension, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.99
</P>
<P>
   One weird movie, this concerns near-future, virtual-reality
games that seem to transport players to alternate worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A genius game inventor (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is pursued by
murderous rivals and joined on the run by an earnest young
assistant (Jude Law).
</P>
<P>
   But what is reality, and what is the game-generated dream?
</P>
<P>
   Director-writer David Cronenberg delivers a dark tale filled
with bizarre imagery and sexuality. It's for adventurous tastes _
but it has its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BONDING WITH DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a stunt man race across crocodiles is creepy enough, but
even scarier is the thought that the role of James Bond almost went
to _ Burt Reynolds?
</P>
<P>
   Both of those frights are among the revelations in a new set of
``Special Edition'' DVDs for seven 007 films.
</P>
<P>
   With the DVD market exploding _ and with the new Bond film,
``The World Is Not Enough,'' due in theaters Nov. 19 _ MGM spied a
chance to make hay.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bond movies already are on DVD, but these new discs add far
more than the movie (although that remains all you get on new
videotapes costing $14.98).
</P>
<P>
   Two Sean Connery Bond films get ``Special Editions'':
``Goldfinger'' and ``Thunderball.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter includes two documentaries, five TV spots, 10 radio
spots, three theatrical trailers, a gallery of more than 600
stills, the featurette Inside ``Thunderball,'' an ABC broadcast
promotion, audio commentary by the director and writer, and a
behind-the-scenes booklet.
</P>
<P>
   The two Roger Moore ``Special Editions'' are ``Live and Let
Die'' and ``For Your Eyes Only.''
</P>
<P>
   The former has a half-hour documentary narrated by ``The
Avengers''' Patrick Macnee, who reveals that Reynolds almost got
the role when Connery gave it up, but Moore prevailed via
friendships with the producers at gaming tables.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and co-stars Yaphet Kotto and Jane Seymour are seen in
recent interviews. We learn that Clifton James' allegedly humorous
redneck sheriff was added to offset the fact that the film's
villains _ and, thus, losers _ were blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a stunt man runs across crocodiles as if the beasts
are steppingstones. (He somehow survives the five takes.) There's
even a milk commercial enacted by the cast on location in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The DVDs also include one Timothy Dalton film, ``Licence to
Kill,'' and two with Pierce Brosnan, ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' and
``Goldeneye,'' each with similar arrays of extras. (``Goldeneye''
also has Tina Turner's music video for the title song.)
</P>
<P>
   The discs cost a suggested $34.98 each or $199.98 in a set. Be
advised that substantial savings are available online.

A RELAUNCH FOR AMERICAN PROSPECT MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a journalistic mismatch. While conservative
periodicals like The Weekly Standard and The American Spectator
generate energy and headlines, the journals of the left _ from The
Nation to Tikkun _ struggle for attention and survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the money and the current prevailing momentum has been
with the right,'' admits Robert Kuttner, founding co-editor of the
Boston-based American Prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The decade-old Prospect _ published six times a year, with a
circulation of about 25,000 _ has evinced some of the symptoms
afflicting the liberal press. Earnest and thoughtful, it
nevertheless carries that commercially damaging aura of what
Kuttner calls ``an academic quarterly.'' Now, with an infusion of
$1.5 million in grants, Kuttner is rolling the dice with a dramatic
relaunch and redesign of the Prospect as a four-color biweekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the old Prospect was better than it looked,'' says
Kuttner, whose column appears regularly in the Globe. ``We felt
that the material deserves a bigger audience than it gets. We felt
there was a huge market for a publication with a niche between The
Nation and The New Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Prospect, which will reach subscribers by the middle of
next week, includes major pieces examining George W. Bush's
popularity in the Hispanic community and dissecting Bill Bradley's
and Al Gore's decisions to tack left in their presidential battle.
In reaching for a bigger audience _ projections call for 100,000
subscribers in five years, and a direct mail campaign has already
netted about 15,000 acceptances of a trial offer _ it's clear that
the Prospect will be less ``wonky'' and a little hipper. With a
staff now beefed up to about 30, the magazine will include former
US World &AMP; News Report editor Jim Fallows writing about technology
and culture and regular TV and movie criticism _ or what Kuttner
calls a ``full-service magazine for liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   That has traditionally proved to be no mean feat, but Kuttner
believes that ``we had a better chance of ensuring the survival of
this magazine in the long run with a bigger magazine.'' The
blueprint, he adds, calls for the Prospect to ``get within spitting
distance of break-even'' within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he initially referred to that projection as a
``five-year plan,'' before quickly amending that language. The
Prospect faces a tough-enough challenge without conjuring up the
Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who says journalists are cynical? In Newsweek's new Voices of
the Century issue, 57-year-old Muhammad Ali, debilitated by
Parkinson's disease and 18 years removed from his last fight,
announced he would ``shock the earth'' by getting in shape and
fighting an exhibition bout with ``two or three contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek obviously made a tactical error when, in touting the
special issue, it published a straightforward press release
highlighting that statement. Because news of the Ali ``comeback'' _
without even a suggestion that it might be farcical _ circulated
all over the world from CNN to the Associated Press. (An item also
appeared in the Globe.) A piece in the Scottish Daily Record
solemnly warned that Ali ``must be prevented from returning to the
ring.'' The AP said that ``it sounds improbable, but Muhammad Ali
says he wants to get back in the ring one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to play the story straight ``took me totally by
surprise,'' says Newsweek's John Leland, who conducted the
interview and points out that the paragraph containing the comeback
line began with Ali saying: ``Now I'm fighting Parkinson's
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to work on Monday, Leland got a call from Ali's
wife, who was befuddled by the spreading news of her husband's
return to the pugilistic wars. ``They were as surprised as we
were,'' he said. Ali quickly released a statement that ``my claim
to return to the ring was said in jest,'' before gratefully noting
that it is ``exciting that I can still get this kind of response
from the press and public.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Husband-and-wife author team Alex Jones and Susan Tifft
conducted roughly 500 interviews, amassed about 60,000 archival
documents, and ended up toiling on their new book for seven long
years. (``Very biblical, don't you think,'' jokes Tifft.) But the
most difficult obstacle to writing ``The Trust: The Private and
Powerful Family Behind The New York Times'' might have been winning
that family's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jones, who left his job as Times media writer to
write the book, he first sent a letter to former publisher Arthur
Sulzberger in 1992 proposing the project and requesting access and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response came back very fast,'' recalls Jones. ``No.'' In
a later meeting, Jones says, Sulzberger asked whether the book
would delve into personal family matters and was told that it
would. That prompted a polite goodbye. But, says Jones, Sulzberger
summoned him to his office a few days later and asked simply: ``Are
you sure you and Susan want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining this family's success at maintaining its newspaper
empire through a time when family ownership is dying, the authors
describe just how heavy lies the crown of the Times legacy. Of the
challenges facing current publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., Jones
quotes one Times executive as saying: ``Arthur knows if he blows
this, he'll burn in hell.''

RULING STRIPS THE POLICE LAWSUIT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge has struck down a 17-year-old
California law that allows police officers to sue citizens for
filing false complaints. The American Civil Liberties Union
heralded the ruling as a significant constitutional victory against
intimidation by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in Southern California was handed down Monday, the
same day a San Francisco Superior Court judge ordered a city police
officer to pay $52,000 to the lawyers for a woman he had sued under
the 1982 law. The woman had accused the officer of police
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a powerful one-two punch to what has been a
longstanding problem with police officers retaliating against
people who file valid complaints,'' ACLU lawyer John Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, a federal court ... strikes down the law. Then, the
Superior Court in San Francisco shows there will be financial
consequences for police officers' trying to retaliate against
people for exercising their First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The California law, the only one of its kind in the country,
explicitly gave police officers the right to sue people who filed a
false complaint against them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Gary L. Taylor declared that law
unconstitutional, ruling it violated the First Amendment right to
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   However, a police spokesman said the law was necessary to
protect officers from people who made false accusations against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is how will peace officers in the future be
able to attempt to clear their good names when there are frivolous
charges brought against them by the public that are unfounded and
unwarranted,'' said Kelly Moran, director of political affairs for
the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge addressed that very issue in his ruling: ``Significant
protections from false complaints are already afforded to police
officers by their internal oversight agencies, in addition to the
possibility of perjury charges for false complainants.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizens have a right to file complaints against any government
official. The 1982 law was enacted after lobbying by police groups
made a special exemption for law enforcement officers, giving them
the right to sue citizens who filed complaints that were knowingly
false and made with ``spite, hatred or ill will.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said the law had been used by officers to intimidate people
from proceeding with their complaints, creating a chilling effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be faced with these sorts of threats has been a major
barrier to police reform, and frankly, to getting management in a
position to deal with problem officers,'' he said.

CHOOSING REPLACEMENT PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Autumn finds many gardeners looking for replacement plants.
Decisions have been made, nursery prices often have been lowered,
and it's just a great time to plant, better in some ways than
spring.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in the cool of fall shrubs and trees put their
energy into developing roots, not tops, which is a good thing for
new plants, and because there tends to be consistent moisture,
which won't be followed by a hot dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   This fall finds me planning to replace a hyacinthiflora lilac.
The one I lost had reached only 6 feet tall, so, while its loss is
a disappointment, it is not a disaster. Another is easily obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the two plants John Peterson wants to replace. His have
to match two that are closing in on a century old with trunks more
than a foot in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, president of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society,
of which I am a member, is involved in the restoration of a
turn-of-the-century formal garden at the Elm Bank Reservation in
Wellesley, where the society is developing 36 acres into a
horticultural education center.
</P>
<P>
   The garden, done in the Italianate style as part of a
landscaping by the Olmsted Brothers, with the passage of time
largely disappeared as plants died or became overgrown. Last
summer, the horticultural society raised the required match of a
$100,000 grant it received from the Massachusetts Preservation
Projects Fund through the Massachusetts Historical Commission to
restore the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two trees in there that are the only plants that are
original,'' Peterson said. ``We would like to hunt out some similar
trees.'' One is a Camperdown elm, with a trunk 14 inches in
diameter, the other a weeping larch, with a trunk 16 inches in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Got any? Peterson is looking for somebody to donate trees of
matching size. Maybe they are overgrown for their current site,
maybe they are in the way of future plans, or maybe their owners
would just like to do a good deed. ``It's going to have a lot of
visibility and recognition with it,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson knows the trees are out there.
</P>
<P>
   Camperdown elms in particular were very popular at the turn of
the century. Ulmus glabra ``Camperdownii'' has a rounded, pendulous
canopy grafted onto an understock. The American elm understock is,
Peterson said, the only American elm that has survived Dutch elm
disease at Elm Bank. It turns out that the disease enters only
through the leaves, and the Camperdown has Scotch elm, not American
elm, leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping larch is Larix decidua ``Pendula,'' a member of the pine
family. Like other larches, its needles turn yellow in fall and
drop. The one at Elm Bank is an attractive tree with gracefully
drooping branches.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the garden to its 1926 Olmsted design is made
easier because it is an Olmsted design, and the company's records
survive at its former offices, now the Frederick Law Olmsted
National Historic Site in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is there the landscape plan, but ``we have the plant
lists, as well,'' said architect Marion Pressley of Pressley
Associates in Cambridge, who is undertaking the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The trees are necessary to the restoration because the
Italianate garden is a formal garden, on an axis with the adjacent
manor house. Viewed as a rectangle, with a marble fountain in the
center, it has the Camperdown elm in one quadrant, the weeping
larch in the quadrant diagonally across. The new trees will balance
this.
</P>
<P>
   Pressley said the main axial evergreens and a beech hedge
surrounding the garden is being restored. Interior beds will have
boxwood edging and are to contain three-season displays of annuals.
The fountain and garden gates and pathways also are being put
right. Restoration of a collection of evergreens ``spottily
placed'' throughout the garden will come another day, Pressley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the bones in,'' Pressley said. The work is
to be completed this fall, which means Peterson needs to find those
trees.
</P>
<P>
   While he has found several trees of the right size so far,
Peterson has yet to find a donor. When he does, he will offer to
replace the mature trees with young versions, and the society will
take care of the removal.
</P>
<P>
   That is being handled by the donated services of Acorn Nurseries
in Boxborough, operated by brothers Sean and Christian Bilodeau,
who are certified arborists. Can they handle this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, last year we moved 13 45-foot sugar maples over to
Harvard Business School,'' Sean Bilodeau said.
</P>
<P>
   They have huge truck-mounted tree spades. One of these can scoop
up a mature tree, haul it to its new home, and plunk it in the new
hole. It can dig the receiving hole, too, though the Bilodeaus
prefer to dig oversize holes, just a better planting practice.
</P>
<P>
   My project, the lilac, will be a tad smaller, if I even get
around to it. Maybe I'll live vicariously through the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society. I'm certainly looking forward to visiting
that restored Italianate garden _ with two Camperdown elms and two
weeping larches.

FOLLOWING IN OLMSTED'S FOOTSTEPS, NATURALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston is the intellectual cradle of America's landscape design
profession, and these days the cradle is rockin'. The U.S. Postal
Service launched a commemorative stamp here last month honoring
Frederick Law Olmsted, the Victorian founder of the profession,
while 6,000 attended the centennial meeting of the American Society
of Landscape Architects at the Hynes Veterans Convention Center.
Lectures there, heavy on history and public planning issues, ranged
from ``The Forest as Avant-Garde'' to ``The Exclusion of Teens from
Public Spaces.'' (It was not a how-to.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a golden age for all who create gardens and landscapes.
Commissions outnumber the garden professionals available to do
them, thanks to the building boom, new money, and the groundswell
of real interest in gardening. Building architects have been
surpassed by landscape architects in earnings. And college programs
are not minting new ones fast enough to fill job openings, says
ASLA president Barry W. Starke of Casanova, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Other landscape professionals are equally busy. Many top lawn
irrigation contractors won't even talk to you in this market unless
you're referred by another customer, says Brian Vinchesi, president
of Irrigation Consulting Inc. in Pepperell, Mass. ``They don't want
to take time to talk to someone who is just price-shopping
around,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I talk to in the business is kind of going wild,''
says Laura D. Eisener of Saugus, Mass., a landscape designer who
teaches in the Graduate Landscape Program at Radcliffe Seminars.
``It's a golden age, but it's also a maddening age because there's
more than they can keep up with.''
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, the money is being spread thick as bark mulch.
Onetime luxuries such as in-ground lawn irrigation systems are
popping up all over. Stone terraces, until recently confined to the
bosoms of matronly old mansions built when labor was cheap, are now
being expensively retrofitted onto younger, comelier homes. And
humble blacktop is being blackballed by the newly wealthy, who
demand driveways paved with brick and stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work on maybe one quarter-million-dollar residential
landscaping job a year in Metrowest,'' said Tim Smith, owner of
Moisturetek, a lawn irrigation company in Medfield, Mass.. ``Now
I'll see a dozen a year in Wellesley, Weston, Brookline, with
swimming pools, terraces, large trees installed, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Residential landscape architect J. P. Shadley of Carol R.
Johnson Associates Inc., one of several celebrated Cambridge firms,
has recently done two half-million-dollar landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bostonians with big bucks are conservative compared to
the new rich of the New South and the wild, wild wealth out West.
Todd Steadman, publisher of Landscape Architecture magaazine, says
he recently heard of a $17 million private residential landscape
commission in California.
</P>
<P>
   Like politics, all landscaping is local, and you won't find many
backyards around here with the grossly modern forms, angular
minimalism, and very bright colors that are considered high style
among avant garden designers. Some people's idea of backyard beauty
may be 30 bright pink poles spaced out on a grid, but not in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few clients who have estate-type places who
want innovation,'' says Shadley. ``There's more ecological
sensitivity to the site here now. It's a slow burn. It's more
subtle here, as compared to the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether wealthy, wannabes, or worker bees, homeowners here have
embraced two major home landscaping trends. One is toward having
less lawn and more naturalistic plantings with native wildflowers,
a tribute in part to the New England Wild Flower Society, one of
the country's most influential horticultural societies.
</P>
<P>
   A newer trend is gardens redesigned to match the period of their
older homes, an outgrowth of Boston's lively garden history
movement. Even people with reproduction Victorian or Colonial homes
are planting antique gardens these days.
</P>
<P>
   But what will future garden historians write about our own
period? It may well be remembered not for all the expensive
stonework and Beaux Arts axis views, but for the simple rediscovery
of plants.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds a tad obvious, since we're talking about gardens.
But except for trees and shrubs left over from earlier times,
interesting plants were almost absent from both public and private
American landscapes through much of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Until fairly recently, most landscape architects worked with a
palette of only 50 or so standard trees and shrubs. Many spent five
years studying engineering and drainage patterns, but needed only
one plant identification course to get their degrees. The result
was excruciating monotony in both commercial and private plantings.
</P>
<P>
   But today, homeowners are no longer satisfied with a ring of
yews and rhododendrons around the foundation, a flowering tree in
the front lawn, and a hedge of hemlocks screening out the
neighbors. Homeowners don't just want color and low maintenance
anymore. They want antique flowers and herbs. They want butterflies
and ecosystems. They want lots of different kinds of plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients are more knowledgeable,'' says Eisener. ``Why are they
suddenly spending $6,000 or $7,000 on landscaping instead of on a
boat or a car? It doesn't seem to be an interest in increasing
their property values. They want to enjoy their gardens, and they
have more interest in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of this interest traces its roots to the 1970s, when baby
boomers started growing curtains of spider plants as symbols of
their embrace of ``the natural,'' bought homes, then tried
``getting back to the earth'' with vegetable gardening (under the
tutelage of ``Crockett's Victory Garden'' on WGBH-TV) and found
that too laborious. You had to grow the stuff and cook it. Still
enthusiastic, these beginners switched to perennial flowers,
because they didn't have to be grown from seed and promised to be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't. But by the time new gardeners became acquainted
with weeds, summer drought, and botrytis blight, they were hooked
on the diversity of perennials, and gardening had become America's
favorite hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these impassioned gardeners, especially women, started
taking courses at garden design programs like the Radcliffe
Seminars. More than a few started home businesses designing
intricate gardens of unusual plants for their friends. Only the
most deluded thought they would ever earn a living at it. And then,
suddenly, they could.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, there were a lot of new gardens designed by
these unlicensed but often very artistic plant experts. Calling
themselves ``landscape designers,'' they were stealing a march on
the highly educated, mostly male, and mostly more expensive
``landscape architects.''
</P>
<P>
   But many landscape architects don't seem to care much. They've
set their sights (and their sites) elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residential work is not where the excitement is for landscape
architects, except for planned communities,'' says ASLA president
Starke. ``We're focusing on larger-scale issues, like reduction of
suburban sprawl and building livable communities. Landscape
architecture is moving from an art toward being more of a science.
It's the broader landscape of hills and rivers, not planting shrubs
and trees in someone's backyard!''
</P>
<P>
   Landscape architects are looking at the Big Picture _ the bigger
the better. Past ASLA president Dennis Y. Otsuji of San Diego
designed one 24,000-acre island resort and typically works on
hundred-acre planned communities in California, where the thorny
Coastal Commission makes environmental planning a must.
</P>
<P>
   Often landscape architects like him are the preservation
advocates on developers' teams, trying to take the sting out of the
suburban sprawl that is, paradoxically, their bread and butter.
``We try to have respect for what was originally on the site, the
hills and valleys,'' Otsuji says. ``We take the high road, while
the developer wants to cut off the tops of the hills to save
building costs. And we meet in the middle.'' He smiles, with a
graceful swoop of his hand outlining an imaginary hill that's
somewhat lower, but still there.
</P>
<P>
   Working on big corporate and civic land projects is also
lucrative, and the slight disdain some feel for residential work
may be linked to feelings that landscape architects lost out in the
1960s boom. ``There was a huge movement in greenbelts and open
space then,'' says Otsuji, ``and the planners and architects ran
with that, while landscape architects stayed in residential work.''
</P>
<P>
   New superhighways were laid out cheap, fast, and straight, at a
cost to scenery and driving pleasure, Otsuji believes. If only
landscape architects hadn't been busy designing Mrs. Biddle's
backyard, maybe they could have been designing better roads, and
getting more money and respect, too. Meanwhile, the modest,
plant-obsessed landscape designers from Radcliffe are only too
happy to design Mrs. Biddle's daughter's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's plenty of work for everyone.

MIDDLE CHILDREN FIND THEIR OWN NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 9-year-old Stephanie Sideris of Watertown, Mass., whose
brother, David, is a year older and sister, Emily, is two years
younger, being the middle child is not a big deal. ``It's mostly
good and mostly bad,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie is not troubled by her contradiction, and neither is
psychologist Kevin Leman of Tucson, a specialist in birth order.
``Her comment is perfect,'' he says. ``It epitomizes the way
middle-borns think. They see both sides so easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of birth order on child development is widely
debated among clinicians and researchers. Some, like psychologist
Joseph Lee Rodgers of the University of Oklahoma, say it is not as
important as parents tend to think. Others, Leman among them, see
it as a dominant force.
</P>
<P>
   From a research standpoint, the middle child is the most
ignored. ``Just like the child himself,'' quips Leman, the author
of ``The New Birth Order Book'' (Revell). But there are tendencies
everyone agrees to. A middle-bornis typically:
</P>
<P>
   --Independent. A second- or third-born may do sleepovers younger
than the first-born did, have a wider circle of friends than the
first-born at the same age, or be the first among his friends to
dye his hair purple. (A first-born may never do that!) Parents
typically attribute this to older siblings' influence, but
psychologist Frank Sulloway says there's more to it. By virtue of
birth order, first- and last-borns tend to bond most intensely with
parents. Middle-borns, no matter how many there are in a family,
tend to be less connected in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic; this doesn't mean they aren't connected at all or
that you don't have a good, loving relationship. But it does make
them more able to make close connections outside the family and
thus to be more independent at a younger age, sometimes more
rebellious, says Sulloway. A professor at the University of
California/Berkeley, he is one of the nation's preeminent birth
order researchers and the author of ``Born to Rebel: Birth Order,
Family Dynamics and Creative Lives'' (Vintage). His research bears
him out. In a recent survey of 7,000 siblings, Sulloway asked,
``Who would you turn to for help in a crisis?'' First- and
last-born children said Mom or Dad, but middle-borns were more
likely to say they would turn to a peer or a sibling.
</P>
<P>
   --Adaptive. With a first-born, the family's schedule revolves
around the baby. With the second-born, the schedule revolves around
car pools for the first. ``If the (second-born's) nap isn't as long
as it should be, oh well,'' says developmental psychologist Linda
Dunlap of Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. When a new baby
comes along, the now-middle child's schedule gets compromised even
more.
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't necessarily make parents feel guilty. ``It's a
fact of life,'' says Dunlap, whose area of specialty is child
development and birth order. ``In the short run, the middle-born
may be cranky or have sleep disturbances because her needs aren't
prioritized. In the long run, this is a person who learns to be
flexible.'' That makes for a good human being, she says: As a
child, a middle-born tends to be a better friend than a first- or
last-born, and, as an adult, he's likely to be a better marriage
partner.
</P>
<P>
   --The peacemaker. With a sibling on either side, the middle
child is typically caught in all sorts of dynamics. ``I have to
share with the older and the younger because I have stuff both of
them like. And I'm always getting blamed for things.''says
Stephanie Sideris. Feeling this squeeze can result in the less
intensified bonding that leads to independence, but it can also
motivate a middle-born to excel at negotiation, compromise, and
peacemaking, says social worker Meri Wallace. She is the director
of the Heights Center for Adult and Child Development in Brooklyn
and the author of ``Birth Order Blues'' (Owl Books).
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to deal with the personality of the younger and the
older,'' Wallace says. ``She becomes the mediator, sometimes even
between a sibling and a parent.'' Understanding the viewpoints of
other family members may begin as a survival tactic, but frequently
becomes a source of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean middle-children can't also be mean. ``On the
one hand, they can be peacemaker and nurturer,'' says Wallace. ``On
the other hand, they can be disdainful and fiercely competitive,
even being the one who tattles.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind all of this is the need to find a niche in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child always feels as if he's in a race,'' Wallace says.
``Above you is the child you are racing to catch up with, below you
is the child you are racing to stay ahead of.''
</P>
<P>
   It can lead a child to wonder: ``If I'm not special for being
the oldest and I'm not special for being the youngest, what am I
special for? If I don't have the privileges of being oldest and I
don't inherit the right to be babied, what do I get?''
</P>
<P>
   In the toddler and preschool years, frustration can lead to
acting out. Dinner is prime time for it, says Wallace: ``Dad's
talking to the older child about school, Mom is feeding the baby,
and the middle child feels left out. Suddenly he's throwing food.''
Or take bedtime: One parent is doing homework with the third
grader, the other is bathing the 3-year-old, and there's the
6-year-old standing in the hallway waiting for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does he do?'' asks Wallace. ``Goes into his room and
trashes it.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady diet of this can be horrific for parents, of course.
``In the early years, it's not unusual to identify this child as
The Problem Child,'' says Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   The antidotes she and others offer are surprisingly simple:
</P>
<P>
   --Make a point of asking for his opinion. The middle child can
be the most agreeable or disagreeable, depending on how squeezed
he's feeling at any given moment. The more you explicitly ask,
``What do you think?'' the less he'll feel lost in the shuffle and
the less he'll need to seek negative attention, says Leman.
</P>
<P>
   --Make time alone with her. Maureen Sideris says if there's one
thing that makes her daughter, Stephanie, light up, it's the chance
to do something alone with her. That's not unusual, says Leman:
``Any one-on-one time you spend with this child really pays off. It
makes them feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   --Support his uniqueness. Many middle children who follow in an
older sib's footsteps do it with a sense of competition _ ``I'll do
it better!'' _ or a sense of failure: ``No matter how hard I try, I
can't be as good.'' Help her identify an area of interest that
belongs only to her, even when it comes to chores; if he likes to
draw, for instance, perhaps his special job is to make place cards
or decorations for family meals. ``You get into trouble when his
chores are leftover jobs the older child doesn't want, or when his
only responsibility is to watch out for the younger brother,'' says
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   If a middle child insists on playing soccer just like his
brother, it doesn't mean he shouldn't; in fact, says Wallace, it
may mean a lot to him to be able to prove to himself that he can
cut it. But don't compare him to how his brother played at this
age, she warns, and help him find some activity that only he does.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the trickiest question for parents is whether a
middle-born chooses an activity because of innate ability or by
default. It's hard to know. Wallace's advice is to support a
child's interests, whatever they are, and to tolerate the
fickleness that often occurs. ``A middle-born who never seems to
stay very long with one activity or interest may subconsciously be
looking for a gap in the family that she can fill. It takes some
kids longer than others to find it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Because of gender distribution and spacing, some middle-borns
don't feel squeezed at all. Leman has five children but only one
boy, right in the middle of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way he has any attributes of a middle-born,'' he says.
``He's a first-born, because he's the only son.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if there's a five-year or more gap between the
middle-born and a sibling on any side, the effects of placement are
erased. Rodgers says temperament can wipe it out, too, although
that is controversial.
</P>
<P>
   For parents who worry that a middle-born may harbor resentment
toward siblings or them, Sulloway is comforting. ``Growing up, they
recognize they get less attention but they adapt by shifting their
focus outside the family'' and they never seem to resent that, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   These are children who grow up to be what Wallace calls ``People
pleasers: sociable, flexible, easy to be with.'' It's no surprise
to Sulloway, for instance, that middle-born children are
overrepresented among Nobel Peace Prize winners.

   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Toddlers are easily frightened by Halloween; they
can't tell the difference between what's real and what's not. Don't
push costumes or masks on them, don't wear a mask yourself, ask
trick-or-treaters to remove their masks, and stress that this is a
day for pretending.

CULTURE CLASH: ALFRED HITCHCOCK, DAVID O. SELZNICK AND A SHOWDOWN
ON THE SILVER SCREEN

 Includes black-and-white photos and slides of director Alfred
Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``It is my unfortunate and distressing task to tell you that I
am shocked and disappointed beyond words by the treatment of
`Rebecca,'''
 &HT;    So cabled film producer David O. Selznick on June 12, l939, to
Alfred Hitchcock, the British director whom he had brought to
America to turn Daphne du Maurier's classic novel into a movie.
 &HT;    ``I regard it as a distorted and vulgarized version of a
provenly successful work,'' Selznick continued, ``in which, for no
reason that I can discern, old-fashioned movie scenes have been
substituted for the captivatingly charming du Maurier scenes.''
 &HT;    Selznick, then basking in the success of ``Gone With the Wind''
(1939), was for once misled by his famous producer's instinct:
``Rebecca,'' starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, would go
on to be a tremendous success, winning the Academy Award for Best
Picture of 1940. And Hitchcock and Selznick would make three more
films together, two of them hits _ ``Spellbound'' (l945) and
``Notorious'' (l946) _ and one a resounding flop, ``The Paradine
Case'' (l947).
 &HT;    From beginning to end, however, the director and the movie mogul
would battle each other. Their collaboration was profitable and
artistically successful, but rarely anything more than polite.
 &HT;    It's hardly unusual for writers to slam directors for
``distorting'' their masterpieces _ among living authors, Stephen
King has complained repeatedly about shoddy adaptations of his
work, while Tom Wolfe deliberately distanced himself from the
notoriously awful movie version of ``Bonfire of the Vanities''
(1990).
 &HT;    But Selznick was a producer, though he assailed Hitchcock as if
he'd penned du Maurier's prose himself.
 &HT;    ``The few million people who have read the book and who worship
it would very properly attack us violently for the desecrations
which are indicated by the treatment,'' Selznick raged.
 &HT;    It's a compelling story, one which is put under the microscope
in an intriguing new documentary, ``Hitchcock, Selznick &AMP; The End
of Hollywood,'' an installment in the ``American Masters'' series
which will premiere on PBS Nov. 1.
 &HT;    When he first hired Hitchcock, the 36-year-old Selznick was
already a legend. He had run a major studio before he was 30 and
created his own studio by the time he was 33. He had enormous
power, dealing on equal terms with studio bosses such as Louis B.
Mayer, Jack Warner and Darryl Zanuck.
 &HT;    Hitchcock, on the other hand, was the new kid in town, coming to
Hollywood after a modest string of suspense-film hits in Britain
which had led him to be pigeonholed as ``a cops and robbers
director.''
 &HT;    ``The dynamic between these two men especially intrigued me,''
says Michael Epstein, the documentary's writer/producer/director,
``in that, despite their dramatically different approaches to
filmmaking, their collaboration resulted in some of the best films
in Hollywood's `Golden Age.'''
 &HT;    Selznick was the only American producer to offer Hitchcock a
job, Epstein says, and the lugubrious Englishman appreciated it.
Every Selznick film was special: At a time when the major studios
churned out more than 40 films a year, Selznick ran a kind of
boutique operation, making no more than two or three a year.
 &HT;    But conflict between the two was inevitable, the documentarian
says, because they approached their business in totally different
ways.
 &HT;    ``Hitch was workmanlike, precise and methodical, while Selznick
was manic and indecisive, usually way over budget,'' he says.
``They were also both control freaks, and each tried to wrest
control from the other.''
 &HT;    In late July, at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena, Calif., Epstein
sat down with Hitchcock's daughter Pat and Selznick's
producer/director son Daniel to discuss why these two legends
butted heads yet managed to produce such great pictures.
 &HT;    Their relationship, Epstein believes, is also the story of the
transition from the old Hollywood studio system, in which the
producer was seen as the creative force behind every film, to the
movie world of today, in which that respect is accorded to the
director _ or, as French critical theory calls him or her, the
``auteur.''
 &HT;    ``Both men had giant egos,'' Epstein says. ``But it's the nature
of filmmaking to be a control freak and have an ego. I don't think
there are very many producers or directors who don't have egos.''
 &HT;    Pat Hitchcock was a child of 10 when her father made
``Rebecca,'' and she says that above all he was devoted to his
craft.
 &HT;    ``Work was the most important thing to him,'' she recalls. ``He
started out very early, and he loved working. He had tremendous
respect for David, but he was driving him nuts with telegrams.''
 &HT;    The evidence in the documentary suggests that, despite
Selznick's zeal to defend ``Rebecca'' against desecration, it was
Hitchcock who had the better taste of the two.
 &HT;    One of the biggest disagreements between the two men, for
example, concerned the final fiery destruction of the mansion,
Manderley, at the end of the story.
 &HT;    For that final scene, Selznick wanted the smoke to form the
shape of an ``R'' in the sky. Hitchcock was understandably
appalled. He chose a much more subtle metaphor _ the memory of
Rebecca goes up in flames as an ``R'' embroidered on her pillow
dissolves in flame.
 &HT;    Daniel Selznick _ whose mother was Irene Mayer, daughter of MGM
studio tycoon Louis B. Mayer _ recalls his father as an unorthodox
man whose spirit was more like that of a writer or director than of
today's producers, most of whom are simply skilled managers and
money-raisers.
 &HT;    ``I think he was fond of Hitchcock,'' he says, ``but he did say
he thought the director might have been a little tired of receiving
14-page telegrams delivered at 10:00 at night.
 &HT;    ``My father would stay up 22 hours and then sleep six or nine,''
he recalls. ``If there hadn't been sunrise and a sunset, I wouldn't
have known which was day or night, watching him. Work drove him
totally.
 &HT;    ``He tried to have a creative collaboration with the great
directors he worked with,'' Selznick adds, ``even though the legend
is that he simply told them what he wanted. But he also listened.''
 &HT;    Despite Hitchcock's many complaints, Epstein says, both men
benefited from their uneasy relationship.
 &HT;    ``Hitchcock grew enormously from his liaison with Selznick,''
the documentarian says, ``particularly on pictures like `Rebecca.'
I think he learned about a woman's picture, but also learned how to
make a Hollywood picture.''
 &HT;    And their collaboration spanned a critical period in cinema
history. By the time the director and the mogul parted ways,
Selznick's career was virtually over and Hitchcock's greatest films
still lay ahead. The studio system was on the wane, and directors
were well on their way to becoming Hollywood's ruling class.

Oct. 22. If you have any questions, please call The Star's News
Desk at (816) 234-4720.

   STARVE: Charges likely today against a Kansas City woman who
allegedly starved one of her children to death. The mother could be
charged with a child abuse law that carries up to life in prison.
Police say a second child may die today. Police say the children in
her northeast home looked like starving refugees. However, the
refrigerator was well stocked with beer, police say. Police say the
woman told them she locked the two children in a room as punishment
and withheld food and water for weeks. This latest shocking death
of a child comes just a week after Pamela Butler's and E'lexis
Crawford's deaths. Neighborhood and community reaction to the
crime, too. Checking with schools and DFS to see if they noticed
any problems with the children. Donna McGuire and Christine Vendel.

   ABUSE (with STARVE): We're checking to see if child abuse cases
are up on both sides of the state line and what laws are in place
to stop abuse. Donna McGuire. 15. Graphic

<P>
   ACCRED: The state Board of Education is expected to vote to
withdraw accreditation for the KC and St. Louis school districts.
Ben Demps will make a last-minute plea today to the board for a
reprieve. Assuming the vote yanks accreditation anyway, the KC
district will file suit Friday in federal and state court
attempting to block the move. The federal suit would seek to
reinstate the state as a defendant in the desegregation lawsuit, on
the grounds that losing accreditation would cause the district to
become more segregated because white students would flee. The state
suit will contend that the accreditation was pulled before complete
and accurate test information was submitted to the state. Photo.

   LONER. What kind of guy is Keith D. Nelson? Some say he is
really polite and a hard worker; others remember the time he
allegedly poured acid in the Butler, Mo., public pool. He's a high
school dropout who never put roots down anywhere and never had
friends; his mother moved her sons to California, Texas and back to
Missouri. Trisha Howard. Mug. 35.

   CODES _ This much we know. Sometime in the near future, we will
exhaust our supply of new area codes, which means, theoretically,
we won't be able to get telephone lines for our offices or homes.
What is less certain is exactly when. One industry group says the

   MUFT. The University of Kansas has been looking to this game for
weeks, knowing it could make their season. The University of
Missouri has at least one foot in the same boat. But the Tigers are
new to the boat. Says Kent Layman: Maybe this is what MU needs, to
get a mad on for a team they hate. But maybe that needs to be put
aside in favor of the realization that even if MU beats KU, that is
just the first of three must steps to assure a winning season that
looks iffy at best. Mike DeArmand. 18-20.

THE RISE OF THE LOWLY PUMPKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pumpkins, pumpkins, pumpkins are everywhere. It's the new
commercialism that inundates us with signs of the season so we will
buy, buy, buy more.
</P>
<P>
   This pumpkin commercialism harks back to symbolism of earlier
times when the harvest was finally in, which was a good thing. But
also the spirits of old dead English witches and ghosts came back
on Halloween, which was a bad thing, as well as a very silly
superstition.
</P>
<P>
   People had to build big bonfires for protection, which are now
outlawed. So we content ourselves with hollowed-out pumpkins,
jack-o'-lanterns, to light the night as the fall settles upon us.
</P>
<P>
   However modern we become, these very, very old folk fears remain
as part of our cultural continuum. They become convoluted,
commercialized, occasionally worshiped. Today they have become a
holiday, a metaphor, like Mayan religious festivals. The residual
folk fears are now a reason to do something fun, in costume, like
ring doorbells for candy.
</P>
<P>
   And upon what does today's metaphor fall? Why, upon the lowly
pumpkin, which is just a big squash. It originated in South America
and comes in many varieties that we eat or use to adorn our houses,
like a Mayan festival to mark the harvest season. The symbolism is
fun, especially if you have children, but if not, then to remind
one of times long past.
</P>
<P>
   The best places to buy pumpkins are our local farms, where they
always have tons in any size, any shape. Plus a trip to the farm is
an enjoyable ride down memory lane, even if just to buy the crisp
fresh apples and newly pressed cider, not to mention the pies,
jellies, and more. The harvest season is not a time for dieting.
</P>
<P>
   For a list of local farm stands, call the state Department of
Food and Agriculture at 877-627-7476 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to
Friday. After hours you can leave your telephone number or use the
Web, www.massgrown.org.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to grow your own next year? Well, it's not
too difficult if you have a nice big open space, in full sun, with
good soil. The old books have the best detailed information, and
the devil is always in the details.
</P>
<P>
   To grow your own
</P>
<P>
   First, dig a hole and fill it with well-rotted manure or mix
one-fifth composted manure with four-fifths loam and good compost.
Then pile back good soil to make a hill 18 inches wide and 3 inches
high. Fertilize about three times during the season. Some people
put a plastic bottle with the bottom cut out in the center of the
hill for giving liquid fertilizer as well as water. Plant six seeds
two inches apart and one inch deep when all chance of frost is
past. If you started seedlings indoors, which is a good idea, do
not disturb the roots when transplanting. When they are three
inches high, thin to the best three plants.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkins take all season. Do not cultivate deeply, as roots are
near the surface, but do pull out weeds. The plants will spread
widely, up to eight feet square. As soon as several pumpkins set on
each plant, pinch off the tips so all the strength will go into the
pumpkins that have formed. As they get big, you may put a small
board underneath to protect the bottoms from rot. Wait until the
stems turn a light greenish yellow to harvest. Cut the stems. Do
not pull the pumpkins off. Then let them dry in the sun for two
weeks until the stems turn gray.
</P>
<P>
   Problems are squash beetles, which come in June and puncture the
leaves, which then wilt. Spray regularly with pyrethrum and
rotenone. Same for stem borers (which lay their eggs June through
July) and thrips and aphids, which carry diseases. For diseases and
blight, dust the plants with a fungicide at first sign.
</P>
<P>
   Old pumpkin soup recipe
</P>
<P>
   Boil center meat, cubed, (2 pounds) with butter (1 ounce), pinch
of salt, sugar (1 ounce), and water (2 cups). Simmer for 1 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Drain in a colander. Put back in pot with 3 cups of boiled milk.
Boil for one minute more. Season to taste and pour into a soup
tureen that has bread chunks in it. Other additives might be
apples, nutmeg, whatever tickles your fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin seeds
</P>
<P>
   Take them out with a big spoon. Wash them, then slowly bake with
salt, or cinnamon and sugar, or vinegar or spices. Children love to
wash them. You won't.

CHIPS ARE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, maybe you should have bought chips, not stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the usual ups and downs, the Dow Jones industrial
average has been flat since April. Meanwhile, memory chip prices
have gone ballistic. A 64-megabyte stick of SDRAM chips, the kind
most newer PCs use, was selling for about $95 in August at my
favorite computer parts store. Today it's $150. This is bad news
for consumers, because cheap memory chips have driven the shift
toward cheap-but-good home computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's also no fun for computer makers. Dell Computer Corp. said
Monday that third-quarter profits would fall below expectations,
because the soaring price of memory is driving up the cost of
building PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean a return to the days of home PCs costing $2,000
or more? Not a chance. But computers won't be getting cheaper
during this holiday season. And machines may not be as
well-equipped as before. Dell says it'll start shipping PCs with
less memory. Don't be surprised if other companies do the same.
This way, they can prop up profits by lowering costs, not raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the consumer does pay a price: Less memory under the hood
often means worse performance. For some jobs, a 400-megahertz
Pentium II with 64 megabytes of memory may outperform a
500-megahertz Pentium III with only 32 megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   How much memory is enough? These days, anything less than 64
megabytes is a sick joke; both the Apple Macintosh operating system
and Microsoft Windows are memory hogs.
</P>
<P>
   If you run memory-intensive software, you'll want still more.
For instance, speech-recognition software like Dragon Systems's
Naturally Speaking needs lots of RAM. So do 3D games, graphic arts
programs, and large databases. And even if you run relatively
light-duty software like word processors, you need lots of memory
to run many different tasks simultaneously. For this kind of heavy
lifting, 128 megabytes would be nice. Only these days that's about
$400 worth of memory. In some places you can buy a whole computer
for that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, blame the earthquake in Taiwan, a vital chip-making
region. It's the easy answer, and like most easy answers, it's
wrong. Or mostly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the quake, memory prices spiked as nervous computer
makers rushed onto the spot market to buy up loose inventory. Peter
Goodman, president of PCs For Everyone, bought $70,000 worth of
memory. A lot of other dealers and computer manufacturers made
similar moves, and those who didn't got into trouble. A guy at the
Cambridge Micro Center told me they were out of some memory
products for two weeks after the big jolt.
</P>
<P>
   But the memory market had actually begun to tighten in July. One
chip distributor told me the shortage developed when manufacturers
began making fewer cheap RAM chips, to focus on higher-priced
``flash memory,'' the kind that goes into digital cameras and those
new audio devices that play music downloaded from the Net. But
Goodman blames the retooling of major Asian chip plants, in
preparation for the next generation of memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, this retooling will drive prices down. If you
buy a stick of memory today, each chip on the stick will generally
hold 64 megabits of memory. You need eight such chips to get 64
megabytes, because a byte is eight bits.
</P>
<P>
   The next-generation RAM chips, due out next year, will carry 128
megabits or even 256 megabits per chip. But these chips will be the
same size as today's, and factories will crank them out at the same
rate.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in the mid-'90s, when memory makers went
from eight-megabit chips to the 64s we now use. It was this
multiplication effect that caused memory prices to plummet, and
that helped launch the age of the cheap PC.
</P>
<P>
   New-generation RAM chips should send memory prices to
bargain-basement levels next year. And with the earthquake panic
past, wholesale memory prices are already slipping. So despite
recent history, there are two things you can count on. In the long
run, stock prices go up, and microchip prices go down.

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, going beyond Clinton
administration policy on the environment, called Thursday for a
total ban on new oil drilling in federal waters off the coasts of
California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposal would enable a Gore administration to
make ``dramatic progress'' toward a cleaner environment.

campaign.

</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has imposed a 10-year extension of a
moratorium on leasing offshore oil tracts and a permanent ban on
leasing in national marine sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign position goes beyond this policy to halt ``all
new drilling'' in federal waters off California and Florida and to
prohibit drilling new wells in existing oil tract leases held by
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect
our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,'' Gore
said. ``I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the
coast of California and Florida. ... I will do everything in my
power to make sure that there is no new drilling off these
sensitive coasts _ even in areas already leased for drilling by
previous administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rubin, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
Gore's proposed ban would force American oil companies to shift
their new drilling abroad. This would make the United States more
dependent on foreign sources of oil and gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that because we are limited in our
access to federal lands, the companies are forced to spend their
exploration budgets overseas and this is going to simply further
that,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the
Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group, said California and
Florida are ``two highly desirable places for complete protection.
It is great news to hear that a leader of (Gore's) stature is
taking a stand to protect both coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement by Gore's campaign noted that the state of
California, led by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, has raised concerns
about proposed new drilling off the coast. The Interior Department
has requested additional information from the oil companies
proposing new exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida, led by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a GOP candidate for president in
2000, has determined that proposed drilling off the Florida coast
``would be inconsistent with its coastal zone management plan,''
the Gore statement said. Chevron has appealed Florida's decision to
Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am placing environmental protection at the very heart of my
campaign for the presidency,'' Gore said. ``I will have no higher
priority as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., in
his bid to succeed Clinton as president. Gore's announcement may
help energize his natural constituency among environmentalists in
California, a key battleground with a presidential primary on March
7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey conducted for Cable News Network and USA
Today by the Gallup Poll that concluded on Oct. 10 showed Gore's
lead over Bradley shrinking to 12 percentage points, 51 percent to
39 percent. A survey in September showed Gore leading Bradley by 33
percentage points, 63 percent to 30 percent.

   Clinton announced a 10-year extension of the federal ban on new
oil and gas drilling off the nation's East and West coasts during a
visit to Monterey, Calif., on June 13, 1998. Clinton's compromise
position, seeking to balance environmental protection with the
economic interests of energy companies, disappointed some
environmental activists who had been seeking a permanent ban on oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., expressed disappointment at the

noting that Clinton's announcement moved the nation down ``the path

SMALL BOX, BIG SERVER

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NetWinder OfficeServer, by the Canadian firm Rebel.com,
brings a breath of fresh air to the stuffy world of network servers
and firewalls. Weighing just two pounds and taking up less space
than a three-ring binder, it combines innovative hardware with
great software in a package that won't intimidate the typical
small-office computer manager.
</P>
<P>
   NetWinder is designed to be a one-stop shop for office
networking. It comes with an e-mail server, a file server, and a
print server, all managed through an easy-to-use Web-based
interface. This combination makes the OfficeServer ideal for small
offices that have a few computers but haven't yet put together an
office LAN. All you need to buy is a NetWinder OfficeServer for
$895, a $25 network interface card for each PC, some cables, and a
$100 multiport network hub. The OfficeServer can easily handle up
to 100 work stations.
</P>
<P>
   The OfficeServer also can connect you to the Internet. For the
typical small office, you can connect the serial port on the back
of the computer to a modem, then use the OfficeServer to dial up an
Internet Service Provider. OfficeServer software lets everyone in
your office share the single dial-up connection. The computer also
includes a built-in firewall, so files and e-mail will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to upgrade to a faster Internet connection,
the NetWinder is ready, too. The computer's box has two Ethernet
interfaces on its backside. The first is for your company's
internal network. The second is for a high-speed DSL or cable modem
connection.
</P>
<P>
   When I first took the NetWinder out of its box, I did a double
take: I knew it would be small, but its truly diminutive size still
caught me off guard. The box measures just 9-by-6-by-2-inches,
which is still enough room for a hard drive (4.6GB with the $895
OfficeServer package; 10GB with the $1,995 version), a speaker, the
two Ethernet connectors, the serial port, the printer port, and
standard sockets for a PC-style keyboard, video, and mouse. Most
buyers, I think, won't even connect a keyboard, mouse, or screen.
Instead, they will just drop the OfficeServer onto a network and
configure it through a Web browser connected to a nearby desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Using OfficeServer's Web-based system administration program,
you can configure the network adapters and the firewall, add user
accounts, set up the e-mail system, and even configure the printer.
The computer comes with software to support Windows, Macintosh, or
Unix-style file sharing. It has discussion forums, Internet-chat,
and even a built-in Web server. This is all standard stuff for most
Unix gurus. What's amazing about the OfficeServer is that it comes
preconfigured with all these features.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes the NetWinder possible is its
StrongARM RISC microprocessor, an extremely fast chip that
nevertheless draws very little power. The StrongARM lets Rebel.com
build a tiny package that doesn't need to dissipate vast quantities
of heat, as do most desktop PCs and laptops built around Intel's
Pentium, AMD's K6, or Motorola G3 and G4 microprocessors. The low
heat and power requirements also make this computer ideal for
Internet Service Providers who want to stick a few hundred of them
into a single 19-inch rack and lease them out to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing that makes the NetWinder work is the Linux
operating system. Linux lets Rebel.com ship a boatload of server
software to its customers free. It is simply impossible to put
together a low-cost network server using Windows because of the
astronomical cost of licensing Windows NT Server and the requisite
software that Windows needs to get working.
</P>
<P>
   I have two big fears with network appliances such as the
NetWinder: backup and security. On backup, Rebel.com has done a
pretty good job. By design, You can back up the OfficeServer from a
typical Windows desktop computer. You can back up just the
computer's configuration, just the user files, or the whole
computer system. If the system crashes, just get another machine
and restore your backup: There are no user-serviceable parts
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But theft is a bigger issue for this small system. It is fairly
easy topick up the NetWinder, rip off all the cables, and carry it
away under your coat. Since an attack like that could shut down
many organizations, it behooves people using the NetWinder to make
sure the computer is kept under lock and key. Unfortunately,
Rebel.com made this harder than it should be. Many computers these
days come with a little slot to attach an anti-theft lock; the
NetWinder doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   I was prepared to dislike the NetWinder. I thought a computer
running Red Hat Linux would be too difficult for most small offices
to handle. But OfficeServer's Web-based management shields all but
the most inquisitive of administrators from the Unix operating
system that governs this machine's brain. I also thought a computer
without a floppy disk would be an invitation to disaster, but it's
clear to me now that most people who use this machine couldn't
rescue their computer with floppy disks if their lives depended on
it _ it's easier for them just to get another computer and restore
their backups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only thing I really don't like about the NetWinder
is its fan. Although small, the fan makes more noise than
practically every other computer in my office. For this reason, I
can't recommend it as a desktop machine. And that's a pity, because
I know a lot of Linux fans, who have already given Microsoft the
boot, would dearly love to be rid of Intel as well. Who knows?
Perhaps Rebel.com has a laptop system in the works that will
overcome this noisy problem.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, going beyond Clinton
administration policy on the environment, called Thursday for a
total ban on new oil drilling in federal waters off the coasts of
California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposal would enable a Gore administration to
make ``dramatic progress'' toward a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is much more than a policy position to me _ it
is a profoundly moral obligation,'' Gore said in remarks via
satellite to environmentalists meeting in Los Angeles. Gore spoke
from Rye, N.H., during a campaign swing for his 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one earth. And if we do not keep it healthy and
safe, every other gift we leave our children will be meaningless.''
</P>

A FORAY INTO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can Tom Lee, king of the leveraged buyout, make it in a cyber
world?
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas H. Lee Co. of Boston is renowed in the world of
private equity for its ability to buy companies like Snapple
Beverage Corp. and General Nutrition Cos., build them into
something more valuable and make a fortune on the way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lee is raising money for a decidedly differnet kind of
investment vehicle. TH Lee Internet Partners, a limited partnership
targeting Web investments, is in the process of raising $650
million and many believe the total will reach $1 billion when the
fund closes before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a few extra bucks in your bank account, forget
about it. Minimum investment here: $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the team that will manage the money joined Lee just this
fall, jumping from the GE Equity venture capital arm of GE Capital
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Coats, the leader of GE's 20-member venture team focused
on electronic commerce, is running the Lee fund from New York.
Colleague Sharon Pipe in London and some other members of their
former GE group are also on board.
</P>
<P>
   Coats and other Lee officials declined to talk to us while they
were getting their venture off the ground. But we have a good idea
about some of the investments that team made for GE, putting
venture money into companies like Net2Phone Inc., StarMedia Network
Inc. and Interactive Pictures Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the Lee fund is a sign of the times, when the
Internet has provided staggering returns for savvy early investors.
</P>
<P>
   The venture funds of CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass., can raise
money almost at will. Softbank Capital Partners, operating from
Newton, Mass., raised $1.25 billion for its first later-stage fund
over the summer and expect to collect a similar amount before their
second fund closes in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Benchmark Capital Partners closed on a $1
billion fund last month and Redpoint Ventures, a new firm led by
well-known Internet venture investors Jeff Brody and Geoff Yang, is
said to be raising more than $500 million in another fund to close
soon.
</P>
<P>
   They all compete with internal investment arms inside giant
technology companies like Intel Corp., which are often prepared to
risk similar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   All that money is being soaked up by larger than ever venture
stakes, particularly in the later rounds of private equity
investments. Late-stage venture rounds of $30 million to $50
million or even more, once very rare, are commonplace today.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its principals, the Lee fund has organized an advisory
board that includes the likes of autobytel.com chairman Michael
Fuchs, former NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer, Net2Phone chairman Cliff
Sobel and Howard Anderson, chairman of the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that Tommy is going to have no trouble raising
money,'' said Anderson. ``He's going to be doing some muscular
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he expected the Lee fund would have enough
financial firepower to begin organzing groups of portfolio
companies that could help each other grow, in much the same way as
Internet ventures backed by CMGI, Softbank and other investment
firms.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors think Lee is going to have a harder time in the
Internet venture world, where other big firms already have
established Web investing reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a tougher landscape than he (Lee)
probably believes,'' said Charles Lax, a general parnter of
Softbank Capital Partners. ``If they are focused on late-stage
(investments) they have to compete with established players like
us, CMGI and even Benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge Internet venture capital returns generated by leading
firms and the following interest of investors have created
extraordinary situations across an entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes reports that the Coats team, then investing in electronic
companies for GE, had proposed a compensation plan to give them a
cut of profits from their deals instead of a pay package based on
the corporate profits of the entire General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   When a note detailing the idea reached GE chairman Jack Welch,
he reportedly wrote ``NOT IN MY LIFETIME'' across the top. Soon,
Coats was working with Lee on more lucrative terms and other GE
venture investors have left for yet other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Internet venture firms themselves are also reaping exceptionally
big rewards in an industry that typically charged limited partners
2 percent fees plus 20 percent of investment profits.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Benchmark will reportedly take 30 percent of
profits off the table. The Lee fund is said to be structured to
take 20 percent to 30 percent, depending on performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet funds are obtaining rates of 25 to 30 percent,'' said
Steven Galante, editor of Private Equity Analyst, based in
Wellesley. ``There's so much enthusiasm right now for
Internet-related venture funds that institutions are willing to pay
the higher rates.''

RACING TO GET A RACE IN ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maura Conron is faced with almost 200 foreign rowers in
need of beds this weekend. Ed Holland is faced with 45 crew teams
in need of oars, boats, or a coxswain. And Katy Bonnin is faced
with making all 200 portable toilets are put in the right place
along the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   The Head of the Charles Regatta has always been about sleek
shells nagivating the 3-mile stretch of river on a late October
afternoon. But increasingly, spread sheets, e-mails, and faxes have
become as much a part of the race as the sculls and the oars.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnin, the operations manager who was hired last March, has
rowed in the Regatta, but has never helped run it. Sometimes she's
at the main office at the Cambridge Boat Club as early as 4 a.m. to
get in touch with rowers in a different time zone and ``because the
phone seems to be ringing 24 hours a day.'' She knows about the 98
boat trailers on Magazine Beach on the banks of the Charles, about
the 100 tents that are being set up, and there is about 400 feet of
temporary dock to assemble. More than 900 volunteers in 32
committees will deal with rules and appeals, awards, and weigh-In.
There is even a volunteer committee called ``Volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the entries for the 35th annual event come from
colleges, high schools, and clubs all over the country, it's no
longer a novelty to get entry forms from abroad. This year's list
of almost 6,000 athletes includes crews from Germany, Ireland,
Belgium, Italy, and France.
</P>
<P>
   So after their entry form is approved, Conron asks the foreign
crews to submit a housing request and Holland asks for an equipment
request. That's when the spead sheets come out.
</P>
<P>
   Conron and Holland have to figure out what the rowers need and
what the Head of the Charles can provide. In Conron's case, that
might mean a French crew who won't have a car and is allergic to
dogs, and in Holland's case that might mean a lightweight eight
boat oars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no idea where everything is, it's like us if we'd go
over there,'' said Holland. ``So we're glad to help them get their
feet wet, and know they'll reciprocate if a crew from the US goes
over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, all the boathouses on the river are lending their
boats, so are small schools, like Brandeis. And if a school like BC
can't help with boats, they offer volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland, a rower who has been volunteering for 20 years, moved
from Boston last year and is national sales director for a biotech
company in Lawrenceville, N.J. He'll come to town Friday afternoon
to see the result of his work, pairing boats with rowers. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so large, I'll never see some of the people I've
gotten boats for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conron, a Brown graduate who is former president of the
Riverside Boat Club in Cambridge, said she got involved when
someone asked her to be the international housing liasion three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now Conron's become part tourist information bureau (she directs
them to local pubs), part innkeeper (she's boarding a Swiss rower
this weekend), and part UN ambassador (she speaks some Italian) as
she directs the rowers to their weekend residences.
</P>
<P>
   And she's apt to do even more. Earlier this week she picked up
Swiss rower Marco Briganti at the airport. She is lending him her
boat to use in the lightweight singles race, as well as giving him
a place to stay at her apartment. (``But you get the pullout
sofa,'' she told Briganti with a laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Conron, an artist who designed the Head of the Charles' Web
site, said she's grateful for the computer age. She gets
information from the potential hosts, then e-mails the foreign crew
with their name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the host and rowers can talk together directly,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And she has learned from experience that there are bound to be
snags in her volunteer job.
</P>
<P>
   One year, three days before the regatta, Conron stood up at a
committee meeting, and asked, ``Does anyone want 24 lovely English
schoolboys?'' (She did find three houses for them, but one was in
Ashland, her farthest location ever).
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when one group of rowers drove away from
the airport in three rented vans and took a very different course
to the Cambridge Boat Club than Conron, who was leading them, had
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know happened to them, but they got hugely lost, and
one van showed up six hours late,'' Conron said. ``But they were
English-speaking, and I figured they would find themselves at some
point, so I didn't get too upset. There are just some things I
don't worry about anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Conron said glitches are by far outweighed by the upsides,
like when a British rower presented his host with a national team
jacket, or the Irish crew brought over a pint of whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Brigtani, who has never been to Boston, never seen the Charles
River, and had never met Conron before Tuesday, seemed more than
willing to trust Conron, as he looked over the boat she'll let him
use. ``Dangerous,'' she said, as if that had not occurred to her.
Then she laughed. ``But it all works out.''

AND NOW A WORD FROM THE READERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase Art Linkletter, you readers say the darndest
things.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years at the Globe and I've never encountered a more
fervent band of readers than those I'm dealing with now as auto
writer. Write something you like (favorite cars of the last 50
years; car wreck songs) and the e-mail and snail-mail pours in.
Make a mistake (label an engine a 442 instead of a 440 for
instance) and I'm caught like a deer in the headlights.
</P>
<P>
   I appreciate the feedback, good and bad _ excepting, perhaps,
the guy in Florida who wrote to say the only way to cure my brand
of writing would be to break all my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is lively, the questions almost always good ones.
Let's answer a few:
</P>
<P>
   I write frequently about ``torque'' and have noted I am
particularly fond of cars whose torque surpasses its horsepower.
What's torque? many of you have written.
</P>
<P>
   Think of torque as a circular, twisting force. Picture yourself
seated, leg straight out on an ottoman. I grab your foot and twist
it. The pressure I apply, even if your foot doesn't bend to the
side, is torque. Or hold one end of a baseball bat while I hold the
other. I twist the bat even as you grip it tightly. That's torque.
</P>
<P>
   Torque is power you can measure at the end of the crankshaft;
it's the transmission of force. Think of horsepower as the powerful
flame in a maple syrup hut. It's cooking up the sap. What you end
up with is syrup: torque.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, picture yourself a sprinter in a 100-yard dash.
The long muscles of your legs are going to propel you straight
ahead in rapid steps. That's not torque. That's horsepower. Now
picture yourself as a backpacker who has come upon a steep, rocky
step. You put one foot up on the step, knee almost waist-high.
Picture your knee from the side and realize that your upper leg
bone, with your knee as the axis, will move in a semi-circle around
that axis. Torque is the power that will boost you up through that
arc.
</P>
<P>
   Torque can make a car doggedly powerful or catlike quick.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle is producing 400 lb-ft. of torque at under 2,000
RPMs, you're pulling something, hauling a heavy load, or plowing
snow, or ought to be. This is low-end, raw power.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle is cranking out 400 lb-ft. of torque at 7,000
RPMs, you're in a high-horsepower, high speed car and ought to be
watching the rearview mirror for blue lights. This is top-end,
speed-inducing power.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of torque, others have written to ask: What is
torque steer?
</P>
<P>
   You encounter torque steer in front-wheel drive cars. When these
cars (think Saab 96) were low-powered, it was not a problem. Now
that high horsepower and high torque have been added to the
equation, it can be.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you didn't know what it was, you'd know torque steer the
first time you felt it.
</P>
<P>
   In a low-powered auto, torque steer means a slight but
noticeable tug of the wheel _ the car trying to pull itself off the
intended steering line _ during a quick start from stop.
</P>
<P>
   As cars got more powerful, torque steer meant the steering wheel
would veritably spin in your hands as the front wheels pulled
themselves off the intended line.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get torque steer in rear-wheel drive cars because
power in these cars goes from drive shaft to rearend and out to
fixed wheels.
</P>
<P>
   In front-wheel drive, however, the ``axle'' must be flexible _
that is, not only feed power to the driving wheels, but also allow
them to bend _ steering.
</P>
<P>
   A constant velocity joint is what lets the ``axle'' do this. But
a CV joint is an imperfect thing because it allows power to be
delivered in an imperfect way out at the wheels on the spindles _
at an angle. This causes a ``twist'' that makes the car pull in one
direction even as its steering wheel indicates it is being turned
in another. Increased power only amplifies the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of power, another reader wrote to chastise me for
praising the Ford Lightning, a supercharged, throwback hot rod of a
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy your column, but praising such beasts as the Lightning
(and SUVs) puts you way out of the new trend in cars. Recent
detailed studies show these vehicles . . . to be: 1) killers, 2)
gas guzzlers, and 3) contributors to the world climate change
phenomena.''
</P>
<P>
   To which I say, right, in some ways, on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not the environmental writer here. It doesn't matter,
when I am testing a car, whether I approve of people buying it. My
job is to assess the intended purpose of the car and how its buyers
might use it. Then I try to impart whether it will perform as it is
intended, for the buyer for whom it is intended.
</P>
<P>
   You mix enviornmental politics with assessing automobiles and
you have the threat of an ugly hybrid. I suspect the author of the
above letter would approve if my environmental politics were the
same as his own and I espoused them in my car reviews.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, as well, he would be outraged were I, say, a chaos
theorist who used my auto columns to promote the notion that it is
supremely arrogant of humans to think that a big hole in the ozone
layer could wipe out life on earth. Sure, I'd say, while promoting
the latest V-12 engine: Humans might be wiped out, but other forms
of life would flourish under the extra ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   I do have environmental opinions. I hope you never detect them.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a reader wrote to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``You and your editor should be ashamed. It's well known that
RPM stands for rotations per minute or revolutions per minute, and
it is incorrect when you refer to RPMs in your column.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader, of course, is correct. But I consider RPM to be an
acronym that has become a word (at least among car folks) unto
itself. If you try to write in a conversational manner _ a good
thing, I think _ then when you have more than one RPM, you have
RPMs. I'll stop referring to RPMs in stories when the first
sportswriter writes that Nomar Garciaparra ``had 10 RBI in last
night's win over the Yankees.''

ON ALL FRONTS, VOLKSWAGEN JETTA IS SOLID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   With some cars, a single word can be used to describe many of
its attributes.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 Volkswagen Jetta GLS VR6, that word is solid.
</P>
<P>
   As in: solid suspension, solid braking, solid acceleration,
solid seats, even solid interior door handles.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's aimed at younger drivers, this is a car that comes
down somewhere between pocket rocket and sports sedan. It's a
little too big and not quick enough for the rocket tag, not quite
big enough for the sedan label. But with its V6 engine turning out
174 horsepower, it will move five people about their appointed
rounds comfortably and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Its outside look begins with the narrow eye slits that are its
headlights, and travels up over the short, rounded snout, the big
sloping windshield, high roofline, and raised, truncated trunk.
</P>
<P>
   The headlights _ single, clear-lens slits _ hold halogen lamps,
turn signals, and side lights. The windshield gives a clean view of
the road as the hood drops away immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the leather seats are broad and give good support. They
could use a bit more lateral support in the form of ridges running
up the sides of the seat backs. Headrests at all five seats are a
nice touch. There is plenty of room for the two front-seat
passengers, adequate leg room for three in back.
</P>
<P>
   The interior ergonomics are simple: a small, easily-read screen
behind the wheel holds tachometer, speedometer, temperature and
fuel guages, and digital readouts for time and odometer. At night,
the lighting for the guages basks the car in a rich
indigo-and-orange glow.
</P>
<P>
   All light controls are to the left _ some on the dash, dimmer
switch on a stem on the steering column. Controls for the heated
outside mirrors, door lock buttons, trunk and fuel cover are in the
driver's door.
</P>
<P>
   Rectangles define the lineup of controls at center-dash.
</P>
<P>
   At the top, an assortment of odds and ends: controls for heated
seats (you can cook buns on these babies), the off switch for
traction assist, the emergency flasher button, and the rear window
defroster.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately below, the slim rectangle that pops out with two
cupholders that get a good grip on your drinks. Below that, a slot
for miscellaneous items.
</P>
<P>
   The audio package is next and, in a day when too many
manufacturers are making these controls look like the inside of an
airplane cockpit, these are wonderfully simple.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the climate controls below. See a button or
dial, push or turn it. Voila.
</P>
<P>
   Seven vents on the dash distribute heat and air in a studied
flow through the auto.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to storage _ and I'm talking mostly small, useable
bins here _ some manufacturers get it. Others don't. Volkswagen
does. The Jetta has a reasonable glove box, rare in the days of air
bags in the dash. The bins in the sides of the front doors are deep
and you can actually put a clenched fist down into one. There is a
money slot between the seats, the fold-down center armrest opens to
reveal a bin, and the backs of the front seats have pockets.
</P>
<P>
   At the rear, the trunk is deep _ golf clubs fit nicely _ and the
60/40 fold down rear seats lets you haul longer items.
</P>
<P>
   Settle in and drive, and, again, the first word that comes to
mind is solid.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration is steady up through third, fourth and fifth
gears _ though for quick passing at highway speeds, you'll need to
drop down to fourth _ and the Jetta's nimble stiffness lets it move
through traffic with ease. On sharp corners, at steady speeds, it
holds its line with little sense of body roll.
</P>
<P>
   All this is owing to a stiff suspension that includes struts,
independent coil springs, telescopic shocks and a stabilizer bar up
front; an independent torsion beam axle, coil springs, pressurized
gas shocks and a stabilizer bar in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   The rack-and-pinion steering is tight and immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Combine power with front wheel drive and you have to deal with
torque steer. Volkswagen has done a good job of it here. It was
barely perceptible even when I tried to induce it.
</P>
<P>
   All-speed traction control is standard on the GLS. Aiding that
system is a feature called Electronic Differential Lock that, up to
24 miles per hour, uses brakes to slow slipping wheels. This will
be good in snow. It's also got another feature dubbed Anti-Slip
Regulation and it uses electronics to control the throttle when it
detects slippage. The ABS, all-wheel disc brakes gripped fast and
stopped the car firmly, even from pretty high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Running down the road, the transverse mount engine _ DOHC, two
valves per cylinder, cast iron block, aluminum alloy heads _ purred
quietly. Even in heavy acceleration, the engine produced a distant
rumble rather than a piercing whine.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission is not as tight in its
pattern as I'd expect in a quick European car with too many
clicking sounds and too long a throw for my taste.
</P>
<P>
   I played the roll of soccer coach/tream transporter, commuter to
Boston, and guy-who-gets-the-newspapers-in-the-morning last week
and the Jetta got just over 24 miles per gallon _ fine mileage for
a car that moves as powerfully as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --The dimpled rubber bottoms in each bin. Put coins, glasses,
pens, anything in them and the items will not slide.
</P>
<P>
   --The tuck-away handles above each door. Great aids in getting
in and out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The placement of the clock in the left quadrant of the main
panel behind the steering wheel. Only the driver can see it. You
can only listen to ``What time is it now, dad?'' so many times.
</P>
<P>
   --The manual seat adjustments. Stiff wheels up the outer sides
of the seats are hard to reach, hard to turn.

FLEET BOSTON FACES CHALLENGE MERGING TWO CULTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's knitting time at Fleet Boston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a rough environment for merged banks, the nation's eighth
largest bank faces a woolly task: blending contrasting cultures and
stitching businesses together, all while keeping investors
convinced that plans won't unravel and targets won't be missed.
</P>
<P>
   It is Terrence Murray's toughest job yet. But so far, things
look good.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since announcing its $16 billion acquisition
of BankBoston Corp, the new Fleet has won regulatory approval for
one of banking's more controversial deals, picked key managers,
sold billions in deposits, and crafted integration strategies. The
company's two leaders _ one hard-knuckled, the other more patrician
_ are slowly finding ways to work together. With Wall Street wary
of combined banks' promises and unforgiving of missteps, Fleet has
been deft and fast.
</P>
<P>
   But despite solid earnings reported Wednesday, a track record at
making acquisitions work, and general optimism among investors, New
England's largest bank could face snags in coming months, according
to some industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fleet, reporting results for the first time as a
combined company, said third-quarter profits rose 41 percent to
$711 million, or 74 cents a share. The result, which Fleet credited
to higher investment banking and credit card revenues, beat
analysts' expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which restated previous earnings to reflect the merger,
earned $506 million, or 52 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Russia's financial crisis depressed BankBoston's third-quarter 1998
earnings, which is one reason the latest results are such an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers give Murray, Fleet's chief executive, the momentum
to confront make-or-break matters in coming months and to prove he
can run banks as deftly as he buys them. Any stumbles or delays
could spook investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upbeat _ this deal has the potential to be a grand
slam if executed right,'' said Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Cleary Inc.
``But Fleet sold this deal to investors on cost savings, and now it
has to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 60, has to find a way to combine his trademark
cost-cutting ethic with BankBoston's traditional focus on revenue
growth _ a hallmark of Chad Gifford, BankBoston's former head and
the number two in the new Fleet. And Murray has to do so without
alienating customers or shrinking his revenue base. With bank
stocks battered and investors sour on banks' post-merger
performance, it is not an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fleet has put its feet to the fire by promising to cut
$600 million in annual costs and to boost earnings by 21 percent in
2000. A veteran of more than 50 deals, Murray has already started
wielding the ax, planning staff reductions in coming months and
beginning to consolidate facilities and computer systems. Judah S.
Kraushaar, an analyst who covers the bank for Merrill Lynch, wrote
in a recent report that ``management appears hell-bent'' on
achieving savings and financial rigor.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which aims to be a broad financial services
provider, has a crazy quilt of businesses ranging from Latin
American operations and investment bank Robertson Stephens to
discount stock brokerage Quick &AMP; Reilly and commercial finance.
Such breadth gives Fleet an enviable arsenal of accelerated
earnings potential and makes the bank unique among its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, with $185.3 billion in assets, estimates that 40 percent
of profits will come from its overseas business, investment
management, asset-based finance, and private equity _ all
high-growth businesses. No single line of business accounts for
more than 10 percent of earnings, with the exception of retail
banking, at about 20 percent. But Fleet's diversity also opens room
for quarrels over how to allocate resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger and more diverse you are, the greater the
challenges, '' said Thomas D. McCandless, who covers Fleet for CIBC
World Markets. ``The next two quarters will be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Fleet and the old BankBoston do not share operations in
many areas outside retail banking, tying things together will be
easier than appears, chief financial officer Eugene McQuade said.
``The minimal overlap makes things manageable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other challenges.
</P>
<P>
   One, according to Merrill Lynch's Kraushaar, who has a long-term
buy rating on the stock, is Fleet's backburner positions in
investment management and stock brokering. Tasks include
confronting a slow-growing asset base and revitalizing Quick &AMP;
Reilly _ a move underway as Fleet prepares to offer brokerage
services in one click to the combined bank's 500,000 on-line
banking customers.
</P>
<P>
   A second sticking point is wholesale finance strategy.
BankBoston is more focused on large, national companies requiring
large loans, investment banking, and capital markets services,
while Fleet has concentrated on middle-market businesses in New
England needing cash management and asset-based financing.
</P>
<P>
   And with 20 million retail customers, analysts say Fleet still
has to decide whether to adopt BankBoston's consumer-friendly model
or to go with its bottom-line attitude _ an approach that has
alienated customers in the past. ``This is where the big argument
in the company is going to be,'' said Nancy A. Bush, who covers
Fleet for Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has not been kind to banks whose mergers stumble _
and for good reason. ``The industry's consolidation record is a
gentleman's C,'' said Henry C. Dickson, an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``But so far, Fleet's doing a pretty good job.''

CONCRETE PORCH FLOOR NEEDS INSULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a ground-level heated porch with a concrete
slab-on-grade floor that is very, very cold. How can I insulate the
floor without raising it more than an inch; I have a very low
overhead. Will a carpet insulate the floor?
</P>
<P>
   MARTIN BARRETT, North Attleborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No, a carpet will not insulate the floor, which is pulling
nearly as much heat out of the room as would be lost through all
the open windows.
</P>
<P>
   There is no compromise: You have to put some insulation on top
of the slab. Apply polyethylene plastic to the floor, set down 2 x
4 sleepers on their wide side, 12 to 16 inches apart, then put 1
1/2-inch-thick styrofoam between the sleepers, and install the
floor; if you put hardwood flooring on the sleepers, you will save
a little thickness. This will raise the floor by 2 1/4 inches. If
that is too much, use 1 x 4s instead of 2 x 4s; they are half as
thick as the 2 x 4s. In that case, apply 3/4-inch-thick foam
insulation and finish off with the hardwood flooring. This will
raise the floor by 1 1/2 inches; you cannot do it effectively with
less than this thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the hardwood flooring, you could put down 5/8-inch
plywood and carpeting or plastic tile, but it will not reduce the
thickness of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My stone retaining wall is 4 1/2-to-5-feet high, and is
bowing outward a bit. I think the bow occurred because there is no
drainage behind the wall, and no weep holes to relieve the
pressure. Can the wall be straightened out? It is chiseled into
ledge, and it is the part above the ledge that is bulging.
</P>
<P>
   JIM KILEY, Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. It is unlikely that you can straighten the bow without
rebuilding the wall. But if the bulge is not so severe that the
wall is threatening to collapse, you can keep it from bowing
further.
</P>
<P>
   Your first priority is to drill some holes in the wall for
drainage; weep holes they are. Drill holes a foot or so above the
ground, spacing them every 4 feet horizontally. Put other holes 2
feet up from the first row of holes. Make a hole by driving a steel
reinforcing bar through the wall. Install copper or sturdy plastic
tubing in the holes. Quarter to half inch will do nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Priority 2: Dig out the earth behind the wall as deep as you can
get, and install crushed stone along the wall. Water will drain
into the crushed stone and the weep holes will carry it away before
it does any more harm.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to dig out a lot of earth on the held side of the
wall, it might be worth tearing down some of the stones and
correcting the bulge. If you do that, don't forget to do all the
other things as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Two long hairline cracks appeared six months ago in the
concrete basement floor of my 3-year-old house. That seems kind of
a short time for cracks to appear anywhere. A mason said I can't do
anything about them. There are no leaks. What can be done?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK GIANNITO, Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The mason was right in that you cannot do anything about the
cracks, but he could have been more reassuring. So the handyman
will try to be: There is nothing you can do, and nothing you have
to do.
</P>
<P>
   A slab floor is not structural, and is not attached to the
foundation. If it is not reinforced with steel bars or steel mesh,
it is bound to crack. Concrete is strong in compression (it will
hold heavy weights such as houses) but weak in tension (sideways
strength), and if the ground settles under the slab, the slab will
settle too, and will break at the point where it did not settle. If
water comes up through the cracks, that is another kettle of fish
that I really don't want to get into.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am repairing my brick steps by chipping out old mortar and
putting in new mortar between the bricks. How long should I let the
mortar set before using a pointing tool to press in the mortar?
What can I use to fill some hairline cracks in the mortar? If the
hairline cracks go through some of the bricks, can they be filled,
too?
</P>
<P>
   AMERICO PERPETUA, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. When you insert new mortar beween bricks, there is no waiting
period before pressing the mortar compactly with a pointing tool.
Actually, you can use the pointing tool (an elongated S-shaped
steel rod) to insert the mortar as well as compact it. And, as you
know, the compaction is important; if the mortar is not compacted
very thoroughly, it will fail in months.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hairline cracks, you can try painting them with a
masonry sealer; enough coats (four or five or more) can actually
fill those cracks, in both mortar and brick. And fill them you must
to prevent water from entering them and freezing in winter, making
them even wider and eventually ruining the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Short of filling the cracks, the only other cure is to replace
the cracked mortar and the cracked bricks. Then again, the steps
could last for years even if the work is not done.

TV ON THE INTERNET: A FUZZY PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   So there's Sam Donaldson on your computer screen, all smiley
with a head shrunk to the size of a postage stamp. He's trying to
drum up enthusiasm for his recently launched news show, which airs
three times a week on the World Wide Web. ``Television on the
Internet,'' he says, ``is a two-way, not a one-way, street.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Television on the Internet, at least for now, is a
frustrating dead end.
</P>
<P>
   What were the folks at ABC News thinking, anyway? You can't just
put an old-fashioned news talk show on the Internet, add a few
creaky ``interactive'' features, and expect to keep viewers. Bad TV
is still bad TV, even if it's on line.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this concept was wrongheaded from the start.
Donaldson is best known for his acerbic, confrontational style, but
on SamDonaldson(at)ABCNews.com, he's trying to be Mr. Congeniality.
Since the show debuted three weeks ago, he has chatted up former
presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter and talked amiably with the
always controversial Governor Jesse Ventura. His questions are
softballs, and the witty banter is anything but. This isn't hard
news; it's soft corn. And when you can find breaking news and the
latest jokes all over the Internet, why would anyone put up with
the limitations of the technology to watch a ``news'' show in which
the host makes quips about Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the former White House correspondent seems to
know he's out of place in this medium. ``I'm quite aware that
you're seeing me in a little box, 2 inches by 2 inches,'' he says.
``But we save on makeup. There is no expensive set back there, and
the technology will get better,'' he promises.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it can't get any worse. When I tried to watch the show
live on Wednesday (it airs Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 12:30
p.m. at www.abcnews.go.com), it crashed my browser three times. It
wasn't any easier watching the archives, either. An interview with
former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin looked like two little Pez
heads suspended in a split screen. Sometimes the screen froze, and
at other times, the video lost pace with the audio, making the
Rubin Pez head deliver Donaldson candy.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem here isn't just the technology or the insipid
content. The real potential of Web television is the option of
interactivity. But like most Web TV, this show doesn't tap that
potential. So far, Donaldson has taken a few ``unscientific''
polls. In one, viewers were asked to evaluate their boss
(``excellent'' or ``jerk''); in another, they were quizzed on the
spelling of, you guessed it, potato. Stal(e)?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are also invited to e-mail questions to Donaldson, but
so far, the format is less spontaneous than that of a typical
call-in talk show. The questions from the viewers have actually
been quite intelligent, but communication on line, whether it be in
a chat room or on a news show, is stilted by its very nature. It's
impossible to get a real dialogue going by typing missives to a
talking head on a tiny screen.
</P>
<P>
   True interactivity may be impossible, but the Donaldson show
doesn't even come close to breaking new ground. The reporter is a
suit-and-tie kind of guy trying to fit into a jeans-and-T-shirt
world. ``Hit me again,'' he says, looking a bit worried that
someone might take him literally. No need to fret. Repeat hits
aren't a danger when it's so easy to just go click.
</P>
<P>

   The Reform Party's list of presidential candidates keeps growing
_ Warren Beatty! Donald Trump! Cybill Shepherd! Oprah Winfrey! _
and the cyber squatters are already one step ahead of the
candidates. Kiley Pryor, a 22-year-old college student in Amarillo,
Texas, bought the domain name www.Oprah2000.com back in March. ``We
would like to make a great deal of money on it,'' says the
entrepreneur, who paid $100 for the Web address and hopes to sell
it to the talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   And there are already several Beatty sites. Beatty2000.com is a
site ``created to gauge interest'' for the actor's candidacy; its
Webmaster, Dave Perry of New Phase Media Design in Nashville,
refuses to say whether the site is paid for by the Bulworth, we
mean Beatty, machine. The actor already has an unofficial tribute
at www.beatty4president.org; it was started by Adrian Wild, a
University of Florida student. ``He's a charismatic outsider,''
says Wild.
</P>
<P>
   So far The Donald, the Talk Show Host, and the Model haven't put
up political sites. But Shepherd has a vanity site
(www.cybill.com), and Trump has a site for his hotel and casino
operations (www.trump.com). One has a platform for Revlon; the
other takes a stand on the Taj Mahal.

   Dubious Internet firsts. Amazon.com has announced, quite
breathlessly, that Moby's performance on  &UR; tonight &LR; 's ``Late Night

Amazon immediately after the show. ``This is an exclusive
opportunity, and it's the first time a song played during the show
will be available for download,'' says Amazon spokeswoman Jenny
Cherrytree. Well, we can't wait for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   We're told that a new site, www.beer.com, embraces ``a total
beer lifestyle and entertainment concept.'' Now, that's a scary
concept. The site has a feature called a bar finder, which helps
you locate a place where everybody knows your name. When we
searched for a watering hole in Boston, we got the response ``Zero
bars found.''

NO NEED TO RUSH, BUT YOU CAN BOOK YOUR SPACEFLIGHT NOW 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Zegrahm Expeditions is booking tourists for their
first flights into space as early as 2003. But would-be space
travelers may have to wait beyond that date for takeoff, according
to aerospace experts.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Zegrahm Space Voyages says it has lined up 250
prospective space travelers, many of whom have put down deposits
for the $98,000, 2{-hour trip into suborbit, where space officially
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Zegrahm's engineering partner, Vela Technology Development Inc.,
is developing the system that would transport these tourists 100
kilometers into space in as few as four years, give them a
2{-minute taste of weightlessness and then return them to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Voyages takes you on civilization's next great
adventure; and takes humankind to the brink of a space-faring
civilization,'' said Pat Kelley, the president of Vela Technology,
in a company statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although space tourists eventually will get a chance to head
starward, some experts warn it may take longer _ up to seven years
or more _ before they get that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia-based Vela Technology is developing a plan to carry six
passengers above Earth in a two-stage process. A jet-powered
``sky-lifter'' would carry the ``space cruiser'' to roughly 50,000
feet. The cruiser _ which resembles a business jet _ is then on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   The space cruiser would use rocket engines to travel to 100
kilometers. It would then employ retro rockets to slow down as it
re-enters the atmosphere. The cruiser would land at a conventional
airfield powered by jet engines.
</P>
<P>
   The $98,000 fee buys a customer more than just the space trip.
Touring astronauts would receive their own spacesuits and and
boots, five days of training, hotel accommodations and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, however, warn that tourist space travel isn't around
the corner. They cite a litany of concerns, ranging from the
availability of financing and insurance to the length of time it
may take to secure regulatory approval. They don't say it's
impossible, they just say it may take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take these predictions with a big, big grain of
salt,'' said Adam Bruckner, chairman of the University of
Washington's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ``This is
rocket science and rockets and space vehicles are very complex.''
</P>
<P>
   It took The Boeing Co. 4{ years to obtain government approval to
fly passengers in its wide-body 777 _ and that was based on
technology of earlier passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
   Like Boeing, space entrepreneurs must secure the blessing of
federal regulators. Vela is talking with the Federal Aviation
Administration and expects a faster review process.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FAA is focusing more of its attention on unmanned
flights, according to one government official, who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), on the
other hand, has applauded some of the efforts. Space tourism is
``going to generate a large amount of money eventually,'' said
Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman. ``These companies are for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the timing may not be set, as long as the economy
continues to thrive there likely will be some customers for
spaceflights, according to John Pike, director of space policy for
the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the big bucks people pay for the price of getting
killed climbing Mount Everest,'' Pike said. ``I would have to
imagine there would be a certain category of entrepreneur that
would not mind having those (space) bragging rights on the golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zegrahm Space Voyages says 4,000 people have at least
asked for information about earning those bragging rights. And
Zegrahm isn't alone. Virginia-based Space Adventures also is
talking to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The interest and the high-priced tickets don't mean launching a
space travel business isn't risky, Pike and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the most speculative business I can think of,
both from the investor getting his money back and the customer
coming back in one piece,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   The speculative nature raises one of the biggest questions
facing space travel entrepreneurs: money. Vela expects to finalize
the financing for the development of its space cruiser system by
the end of the year, according to Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   But in an age of Internet startups and software success stories,
the handful of firms developing reusable space vehicles are
generally having a hard time attracting venture capital, said Eric
Stallmer, president of the Space Transportation Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Zegrahm-Vela project is a private venture, according to
officials from both companies, and so isn't relying on government
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Those financing challenges could delay the first commercial
spaceflight by a few years, Stallmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something like this along these lines is closer to
being ready in five to seven years,'' Stallmer said.

TEAM THAT PRODUCED `TAXI DRIVER' TRIES AGAIN, WITH LESS SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago, director Martin Scorsese and
screenwriter Paul Schrader collaborated on a grim portrait of a New
York City loner called ``Taxi Driver.'' Despite its relentlessly
ugly vision of life, it somehow tapped into the zeitgeist of the
time, and became an instant classic.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' this partnership has reunited
for a long-time-in-coming follow-up about another Manhattan loner
with a stressful job. Schrader says it's not so much a sequel as a
``bookend,'' but, clearly, they're trying to make lightning strike
twice in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it doesn't. Scorsese's legion of admirers will
find pockets of brilliance, and the movie has a certain morbid
fascination, but it has no real bite, and finally seems so
contrived and pointless it borders on being out-and-out
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the early '90s, it's about Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage), a
burnt-out paramedic on the verge of a breakdown who works the
graveyard shift in hell _ Hell's Kitchen, that is. Zooming from
tenement to crack house to back alley, and one crisis after
another: cardiac arrests, gunshot wounds, drug overdoses, births,
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The script is episodic, following the near-psychotic character
over three days with three different partners _ each crazier than
the last _ as he constantly sees the ghosts of patients he's lost
(hence the title), and stumbles into a sort of relationship with an
ex-junkie (Patricia Arquette) whose estranged father he tries to
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   As always with Scorsese, the film has a shimmering technical
polish, an overlay of dark humor (much of it delivered by Scorsese
himself, as the voice of the dispatcher), strong supporting
performances (especially Ving Rhames as a Jesus-freak paramedic)
and a good star turn: Cage plays the character with an appealing
world-weariness and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But it's never hugely engaging, possibly because the character
is never especially believable, and the crux of his emotional
ordeal _ why he became a paramedic, why he stays one, why he feels
such smothering personal guilt _ somehow gets lost amidst all of
Scorsese's camera tricks, and Schrader's cheap laughs.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as they try to come up with another ``Taxi Driver,''
they also just can't make this film rise up to be more than the sum
of its uneven parts. In the end, it seems the calculated work of
two wealthy filmmakers who are now so far removed from these mean
streets that they can only approach them in terms of an
insensitive, dehumanized, burlesque show.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Out the Dead. Directed by Martin Scorsese. Screenplay
by Paul Schrader. Cast: Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John
Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom Sizemore. Paramount/Touchstone. 118
minutes. Rated R for violence.
</P>

Big 12 sets championship venues 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ For the first time since establishing Fort Worth-Dallas as
its base of operations when the league was created, Big 12
officials will host some of its highest-profile championship events
in its own back yard.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big 12 board of directors, composed of presidents and
chancellors from the member schools, approved proposals Wednesday
to settle future championships in football, men's basketball and
women's basketball at area venues. The first championship event in
Fort Worth-Dallas will be the 2001 football title game, to be
played at Texas Stadium in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the under-construction American Airlines Center in
Dallas will play host to the men's basketball tournament in 2003
and 2004, with the women's event to be played during the same
seasons at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Weiberg, Big 12 commissioner, said The Ballpark in
Arlington remains under consideration as a host site for at least
one future conference baseball tournament. But those negotiations
will not be finalized until next month, Weiberg said. No new
agreements regarding baseball sites were announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg cited ``a real desire and intent to try some new
locations'' as a factor in administrators' decisions to bring
championship events to Fort Worth-Dallas. He also confirmed that
the winning bids offered the best financial deals for the Big 12,
but declined to cite specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Texas Stadium as host site for the 2001
football game came in conjunction with the announcement that the
2000 game would be played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.
League officials also voted to continue rotating the football game
between northern and southern sites through 2003, with venues for
the 2002 (northern) and 2003 (southern) games to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting open-air stadiums to host the next two football
championship games, league officials allow the possibility of
adverse weather conditions to impact the outcome for the first
time. The first four football championship games rotated between
the TWA Dome in St. Louis (1996, 1998) and the Alamodome in San
Antonio (1997, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're taking some risk in regard to the weather,''
Weiberg said. ``We gave that a considerable amount of discussion.
But there was a comfort level ... in knowing those stadiums can
support the games and offer our best financial situations.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bid process, Big 12 officials were offered the
opportunity to play the 2001 game at Texas Stadium or the Cotton
Bowl. Weiberg said Texas Stadium was selected because it offered a
greater ``showcase'' opportunity and administrators consider it ``a
better football-playing facility, at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In selecting Dallas to hold basketball tournaments in 2003 and
2004, Big 12 officials broke with tradition. Since the league began
competition during 1996-97 school year, all basketball tournaments
have been played in Kansas City, where the men's event is a
perpetual sellout. Weiberg said administrators considered it vital
to keep the men's and women's tournaments in the same city and
viewed moving the event to Dallas as an opportunity to create
interest in a market that was slow to embrace the Southwest
Conference basketball tournament during its waning years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the Big 12 tournament is the SWC tournament. We
think with the quality of basketball we'll bring to Dallas, the
event will be successful,'' Weiberg said.  &QL; 
Big 12 championship venues With agreements announced Wednesday, Big
12 officials have settled on championship venues for multiple years
in football and basketball. Below is a breakdown of where upcoming
championships will be played: School year Football Basketball (M&AMP;W)

SCELZI'S THE TOPS, AND WANTS TO STAY THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the NHRA makes its annual autumnal visit to the Texas
Motorplex this weekend, here is all you need to know about Top Fuel
driver Gary Scelzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been anything but Winston champion,'' said Scelzi,
neatly summarizing his 1997 and 1998 seasons. ``I don't want to
lose it. I don't want to lose it because I like it. I like signing
my name with `No. 1' after it. There's not any less drive in me not
to compete as a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   For the six other drivers still mathematically eligible to win
the National Hot Rod Association's most prestigious championship,
those words are fair warning. Beginning with the 14th annual
O'Reilly Fall Nationals in Ennis, three events remain on the
22-race schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And Scelzi is still hanging around. He sits in third place, 66
points behind first-time title contender Tony Schumacher and 46
points behind five-time Winston Top Fuel champion Joe Amato.
</P>
<P>
   A maximum of 138 points is available this weekend, which means
Doug Herbert (75 points out of first), Kenny Bernstein (98), Mike
Dunn (124) and Doug Kalitta (135) remain viable players at The
Plex. Some, of course, will be more viable than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the seven teams in this deal, I would think Gary Scelzi
with \Rcar-owner/tuner\S Alan Johnson is going to be the hardest to
beat,'' said Herbert, winner of consecutive races in Topeka, Kan.,
and Memphis, Tenn. ``Gary gets pressure on him, and he's driving
like a maniac. Not crazy, but good. Alan gets pressure on him,
he'll put the thinking cap on and start figuring out what he needs
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're motivated. They've got something they could lose. In
my opinion, they're the ones I'd be most worried about going into
these last three races.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the all-concrete Motorplex quarter-mile has been
one of the favorite venues for Scelzi, Johnson and Team Winston.
When it appeared that Scelzi was about to disappear from the Top
Fuel radar screen five races into the season, a victory in the
Castrol Nationals in Ennis in late April reinstated the car known
as ``Big Red'' as a player. Scelzi won two more races, in Commerce,
Ga., and at the end of June in Madison, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi lowered the NHRA Top Fuel national elapsed-time record to
4.525 seconds and won the fall race at the Motorplex last year, key
elements to his second consecutive championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those super racetracks,'' Scelzi said of Billy
Meyer's facility. ``Our car is suitable to tracks that make a lot
of power. It's going to be interesting. I don't think you'll see
cars that normally don't win end up in the final here. And the last
three tracks we go to, you'll see some incredible ET and speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   In between one-on-ones against Cory McClenathan, Bernstein and
Kalitta, Scelzi has wheeled the division's dominant car since
succeeding the late Blaine Johnson in the fall of 1996. Scelzi won
five races as a rookie in 1997, including his first two starts, and
another six in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But this season has been notable for its inconsistencies,
punctuated by the fact that Schumacher has led the standings since
the U.S. Nationals on Labor Day weekend despite never having won a
race. And Amato, whose five victories lead the division, somehow is
stuck in second.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never not been a dominant car in all the seasons
I've been around Winston Drag Racing,'' said Scelzi, a 39-year-old
resident of Fresno, Calif. ``I've never seen it like that. Normally
there's some that's hot, but even when they cool off, they're not
that bad. The inconsistency among the teams is probably the
strangest thing I've seen this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do understand why. There's so many teams that can run
low numbers, that you can't run soft. You've got to run it like
it's a final round every time, or you're going to get beat. A lot
of times they'll send you home packing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi said this points race has been great for team morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan and I always assure our crew they're the baddest on the
planet,'' Scelzi said. ``Morale is good, but Alan's going to give
them a pep talk when we get to Texas Friday morning, and turn the
stereo up and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi also said this points race has been great for the
two-time reigning series champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single round is a factor in the points chase,'' Scelzi
said. ``I'd rather have it like \RFunny Car champion\S John Force _
win it early and keep the lead. But nobody wants to see a chase for
second. They want to see a chase for first.''

   SPOTLIGHT ON... Ray's `off-season' full of testing tires, trucks
Newly crowned Indy Racing League champion Greg Ray says he has a
dream vacation all planned. Ray would love to take his wife,
Angela, and sons Winston and Simon, on a wind-surfing vacation in
Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   But probably not this year.
</P>
<P>
   And actually ... ``forgetaboutit''.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after wrapping up his first IRL title at Texas
Motor Speedway, Ray has been booked to start four days of tire and
engine testing at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Ray and Team Menard
are Firestone's lead tire-testing team, and he is scheduled to
spend Friday and Saturday turning laps for the manufacturer using
the league's current 4.0-liter Aurora V-8 engine for a baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we'll go to the 3.5-liter engine on Sunday and
Monday, and we won't see a 4-liter engine again,'' said Ray,
referring to the rules package that goes into effect in 2000. ``We
don't have the new \RDallara\S chassis yet, but we're already
working on tire development for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the engine, we'll find out its nature and quirks. It's
going to turn more RPMs, like 11,000 RPMs. They've reversed the
crank angle so it's going to change the sound. With the new chassis
and gear boxes, although we'll lose horsepower, you can count on
the cars being about as fast as they were this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray laughed at the notion that after a season that stretched
from January to mid-October, his comp time was about to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and June is my busy time of the season,'' said
Ray, whose four poles and three victories led the series in his
first season of driving for car-owner John Menard. ``We have a lot
of things going on under the tent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he and Menard have abandoned the idea of an appearance
in the Championship Auto Racing Teams season ender Oct. 31 at
California Speedway. Menard is partners in Robby Gordon's CART
adventure, and Ray said the possibility of running with that
series' regulars on the two-mile speedway was intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity is still there, but we're so focused on our
IRL program,'' Ray said. ``It'd be fun to do that, if you had great
equipment. But they have a championship coming down to the wire,
and we have our own agenda in front of us. I don't think there's
anything to gain from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ray said he definitely will figure into Menard's
plans to compete in the NASCAR truck series in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With John Menard purchasing the No. 3 truck team, over the
course of the winter we'll do some testing and probably run a
couple of truck races for fun,'' Ray said. ``Because driving
different cars broadens your horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   Menard reportedly has agreed to purchase seven Chevrolet
Silverado trucks from the inventory of owner Richard Childress. Jay
Sauter, current driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus
truck, won the O'Reilly 300 from the pole at TMS on Oct. 15. The
series concludes Oct. 30 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Menard has hired 1996 truck-series rookie of the year Bryan
Reffner as his driver and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how the truck team goes,'' Menard said. ``I'd like
some day to get to Winston Cup with that team, but you have to walk
before you run. If we start winning races in the truck series, you
can figure that team is going to get ready to go to Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who has completed only the first year of a five-year
contract with Menard, said he is excited by the seemingly endless
possibilities afforded by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for any reason we become bored or complacent \Rwith the
IRL\S, and if we decided collectively we wanted to go CART racing,
then we would do that,'' said Ray, speaking of Menard and team
manager Thomas Knapp. ``If we decided collectively we wanted to go
Winston Cup racing, then we would do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exciting thing for me is my team owner is John Menard. If
we want to go do it, there's no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny Car driver Force's hints Fuel speculation
Eight-time Funny Car champion John Force is promising a blockbuster
announcement about his current two-car team during the NHRA's fall
tour through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Force said the announcement, backed by high-profile sponsors
Ford and Castrol GTX, could be about his long-rumored Top Fuel
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a dragster or a Funny Car,'' said Force, who is
bearing down on his record ninth NHRA Funny Car championship.
``We'll either do it at Dallas or Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA visits the Texas Motorplex in Ennis for the 14th annual
O'Reilly Fall Nationals this weekend, then heads to Houston Raceway
Park in Baytown on Oct. 28-31.
</P>
<P>
   Force said his victory against Top Fuel ace Bob Vandergriff Jr.
in the final of the inaugural Winston Showdown at Bristol (Tenn.)
Dragway in July was ``a very big high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bristol win against the dragster really got me thinking
dragsters,'' Force said. ``You talk about a high; it felt like they
put me on straight nitro. My head wanted to come off. I got to race
Kenny Bernstein and Bob Vandergriff, and it was just really
exciting. It was just kind of unique. It was probably the biggest
high in my career, bigger than my first championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something neat is going to go down. A dragster would be
exciting. It's going to be something where you say, `That goofy
sonofagun did it again.' I talked to a number of crew chiefs, a
number of drivers. Just hang on. I'm excited about it. Get me
drunk, I'll tell you. Otherwise I can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS Sonntag replaces Starr Fort Worth's David Starr is
out as driver of the No. 73 Chevrolet owned by Joey Sonntag in the
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   B.A. Wilson of Carrollton is scheduled to debut for the team at
the season-ending NAPA 200 at California Speedway on Oct. 30.
Originally from Bonham, Wilson drove the No. 85 Ford to a
24th-place finish in the O'Reilly 300 at Texas Motor Speedway on
Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Starr started a season-high eighth but finished 32nd at TMS
after an early brush with the wall. Starr's best finish in 23
starts this season is 14th, in the Pronto Auto Parts 400 at TMS in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been thinking about this as long as two months ago,''
said Sonntag, whose team is based in Little Elm. ``I wanted to make
this deal work and let it go. At Texas, we mutually agreed it was
time for me to have a fresh start with a new driver and for him to
open up his options.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been rumored to be under consideration for trucks
rides with Petty Enterprises and Roush Racing. Rain follows Outlaws
Promoter Lanny Edwards has been flat out of luck when his Devil's
Bowl Speedway plays host to the World of Outlaws. Two of the three
appearances by the Outlaws at the half-mile dirt track in Mesquite
were hampered by rain this year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the final night's main event was stopped after eight
laps because of rain and made up one month later. Saturday's
championship main event also was rained out. Gary Wright, who won
Friday's preliminary, was declared the champion.
</P>
<P>
   The rain came after 18 drivers had qualified in front of what
Edwards said was the biggest crowd he had played host to. He
estimated the attendance at more than 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said fans who purchased tickets for Saturday night's
event can exchange them for tickets to one night of next year's
Spring Nationals, scheduled for March 17-18, or send a
self-addressed, stamped envelope to Devil's Bowl for a refund.
Merchandise on sale Racing fans can stock up on merchandise from
top drivers during the annual ``NASCAR Sale-abration'' at Texas
Motor Speedway on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway trailers will feature merchandise from the inventories
of Dale Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Mark Martin, Terry and Bobby
Labonte and Jeff Burton, among others. Greg Ray, the newly crowned
Pep Boys Indy Racing League champion, also will have merchandise
available, as well as new 2000 logo TMS items. Most will be priced
from 25 to 50 percent off.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will receive a one-lap ride around the 1.5-mile
racetrack for each $50 spent on driver and/or speedway merchandise.
Fans spending $100 or more will receive a pair of qualifying
tickets for the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup race in addition to the
track ride.

The resurfacing schedule at Texas Raceway in Kennedale has been
shuffled because rains that soaked the area this week.
</P>
<P>
   Resurfacing of the eighth-mile drag strip got underway
yesterday, but plans to be in operation this weekend have been
shelved, with the track now scheduled to reopen Oct. 30 for a full
schedule. Minority drivers to test
</P>
<P>
   Three drivers selected for CART's inaugural African-American
Driver Development Program are scheduled to log their first test
miles Tuesday at Buttonwillow Raceway, north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Selected for the test in a Toyota Atlantic race car are David
Francis Jr. of Los Angeles, Andrew Kelley of Columbus, Ohio, and
Bill Lester of Oakland, Calif. The drivers are to receive a seat
fitting and be familiarized with the open-wheeled cars Monday at
the Cal Wells-owned PPI race shop in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Each driver is scheduled to run approximately 100 miles during a
test conducted by Arciero-Wells Racing. The PPI team plans to make
a series of changes to the car and evaluate how each driver
responds on the track. A debriefing session follows.
</P>
<P>
   If merited, one of the three could move to an Indy Lights test
with Team KOOL Green, as the Championship Auto Racing Teams looks
to discover and develop minority drivers. Last words ``When I was a
kid _ which goes to show you how old A.J. is now _ I remember
reading a book about him when I was in the fifth grade. I idolized
him.'' _ IRL champion Greg Ray of Plano

TCU TAILBACK TOMLINSON GAINING YARDS, NATIONAL ACCLAIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It is 1 o'clock on Monday afternoon, and the
guy on the line from ``USA Today'' wants to know how many earrings
LaDainian Tomlinson wears.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in each ear,'' Tomlinson says, looking puzzled. ``But I
take them out during the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it, L.T.; when you're the leading rusher in the
nation, they'll ask you anything.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. They already asked about the tattoos?
</P>
<P>
   Four. One is a picture of his mother, Lorene Chappell. One bears
the initials, ``L.T.'' One is a representation of God's hands,
folded in prayer. The fourth is a picture of the Waco University
Bulldog, his high school mascot.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few others, actually _ most of them adorning the
helmets of TCU opponents. They look like cleat marks.
</P>
<P>
   In only six games as the lone resident at the tailback position,
which he shared last year with Basil Mitchell, Tomlinson, a
5-foot-11, 217-pound junior, has become a burgeoning star with a
rapidly expanding audience.
</P>
<P>
   With 178 yards against Tulsa last week, he became the first back
in TCU history to top the 1,000-yard mark in six games. He has
1,060 yards on 145 carries, averaging 7.3 yards per pop. At 176.7
yards per game, he leads the nation by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   He has used his 4.3-second speed to break for scoring runs of
74, 79, 80 and 89 yards and has bulled his way through a tangle of
defenders on close-in scoring thrusts. In three of the past four
games, he has been selected offensive player of the week in the
Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a 300-yard explosion against San Jose State, he
was approached by a weary foe, who said, ``What are you trying to
do, win the Heisman Trophy in one day?''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, a national publication identified him as
the best unknown back in America. Now, he is being interviewed from
afar on the cultural significance of body-piercing.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked into the TCU football offices Monday, secretary
Jennette Forrester high-fived him. And, as revealed in a local news
item this week, in regional rushing statistics, he ranks just ahead
of Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm surprised at some of the things he's done ...
well, that he's leading the nation,'' coach Dennis Franchione said.
``But I'm not surprised at the way he's played. We thought he could
perform this way, and in fact, I think his rushing total is about
what he and Basil together had at this point last year. It's just
that now, he's doing it by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with a few friends. After a scolding by Franchione
following a loss in which Fresno State keyed exclusively on
Tomlinson and held him to 49 yards, TCU's offensive linemen have
developed a steamroller complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks, the holes have been unbelievable,''
Tomlinson says. ``On that (TCU record) 89-yard run against San
Jose, I wasn't thinking about a long run, just about helping us
punch out and start a drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I saw the hole, I knew it was a touchdown. Actually,
I was kind of running for my life, because I figured that after the
hole they opened, these guys would kill me if I let anyone catch
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I think they enjoy those plays as much as I do,
because we're all involved in it together. But I may have to take
everyone out to dinner at the end of the season. Probably have to
borrow some money from my mother, though.''
</P>
<P>
   A logical thought. Tomlinson's parents divorced when he was in
grade school, and Lorene, a real estate agent who lives in Dallas,
became the strongest influence on his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still talk to my dad, and I also had a stepdad for awhile,''
he says. ``But my mother raised me. Everything I needed to know
about being a man _ how to act, what to do _ my mother taught me.''
</P>
<P>
   It has always been one of the more impressive things about
Tomlinson, which is why, Franchione says, it was such a shock when
Tomlinson and former TCU basketball player Lee Nailon, among
others, were arrested last summer at a motel where a robbery had
taken place and where police found evidence of a controlled
substance. Eventually, the players were released and no charges
were filed, but Tomlinson said he learned a lesson about being in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over there that morning to see Lee, because he had just
got back in town and that's where he was,'' Tomlinson says.
``Something had evidently happened there a few hours earlier, but I
didn't know anything about it. But the police came, and we all got
taken to jail. I was still wearing my sweat suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione said that ``when I got the phone call, I said, `That
doesn't sound like L.T.' I was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, I give them a speech about how when you sign to
become a Division I player, you have a responsibility to be careful
in your relationships and in where you go, but they don't always
listen. L.T. is a guy who simply takes everyone at face value and
just doesn't think about those things happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, however, said he is a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that anything can happen,'' he said. ``Mostly, I
just stay at home now with my girlfriend (Lakesia McKinney). I
don't go out much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tomlinson and younger brother LaVar, a two-way player at
Dallas Samuell, manage to keep Lorene on the run.
</P>
<P>
   When Tomlinson burst through the startled Spartans on the
89-yard run, Lorene was on her feet at Amon Carter Stadium, tears
streaming down her cheeks. When he went 74 on a pitch moments
later, it was a bit much. She had to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   ``She missed the Tulsa game,'' he said, laughing, ``because
Samuell had a game that night and she went to see LaVar play.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she missed the 80-yard option on which he burned through a
seam, outran the pursuit down the sideline, cut back inside a final
defender, and delivered the blow that signalled the beginning of
the Golden Hurricane's end. At this rate, he will create enough
highlight film to open a studio by season's end.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite run? Why, that 9-yarder in the fourth quarter
against Arkansas State, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that's the best run I've had,'' he said,
``because it got us a first down when we needed it, and I stayed in
bounds, too. That allowed us to run about two more minutes off the
clock, and that's what we were trying to do to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it because he landed right at my feet on the
sideline,'' he says. ``We didn't block it very well, but he broke a
tackle and dove for the first-down marker and made it. And stayed
inbounds to run the clock. Those are the kind you remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he already has one more carry than he had in all of
last season, Tomlinson, whose longest run in '98 was 36 yards, said
he is one of those tailbacks who gets better as the game wears on.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, you're a little tentative, you don't know where the
seams are,'' he said. ``And last year, it was hard to get in a
groove coming in and out of the game. This way, you see the seams
better as the game goes on, you know what the blockers are going to
do, you know where to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, no argument from Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you worry about the wear on him,'' he said. ``But
against Arkansas State, he had 40 carries and proved he could
handle it (269 yards). If you have a big weapon, you use it.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Tomlinson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rested and still hungry,'' he says. ``Tailbacks are made
to run.'' nn

NEBRASKA MYSTIQUE STOPS AT TEXAS BORDER
</HEADLINE>
 12 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the only Division I-A school to win three national
championships in the 1990s, Nebraska has every right to crow about
being college football's team of the decade. Not even the
staunchest football fan from Florida State can quibble with that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is a stunning reversal of fortune when the Big Red
butts heads with teams from the other side of the Red River. Since
the creation of the Big 12, Nebraska is 29-4 against conference
opponents and owns winning records against all but two schools.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters are Texas (0-2) and Texas A&AMP;M (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   This puzzles the Cornhuskers, who lost as double-digit favorites
on three occasions. But it makes sense to me. And the theory is
seconded by players, all of them native Texans who were not
brainwashed from birth by the Midwestern misconception that
Nebraska perfected the sport of college football.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put: Children of the Corn, you've got no fear factor down
here.
</P>
<P>
   Showing up in those white helmets with an ``N'' on the side
might be worth 14 points against Kansas, Iowa State and Oklahoma
State. It was worth more than that against Kansas State until a
quarterback from Texas, Michael Bishop, helped alter the mind-set
in Manhattan, Kan., and ended a 30-year losing streak in that
series.
</P>
<P>
   But the third-ranked Cornhuskers (6-0, 3-0) won't have any
mental mojo working for them when they meet No. 18 Texas (5-2, 2-1)
on Saturday in Austin. Nor will they take the field against a bunch
of intimidated Aggies when No. 13 A&AMP;M (5-1, 2-1) visits Lincoln,
Neb., on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Let's do the math that unravels this mystery. The majority of
today's college players are 20-22 years old. Their most
impressionable childhood years came and went between 1987-93.
During that stretch, Nebraska lost seven consecutive bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   For budding football stars in Texas, those postseason contests
offered a rare glimpse of Nebraska football in the pre-Big 12 days.
And it was not an impressive sight. Contrast that to players who
grew up watching weekly telecasts from the old Big Eight, when
Nebraska steamrolled everyone. The residual effects are evident
today.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Texas receiver Ryan Nunez, an Austin native who played
his freshman season at Colorado (1996) before transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be very true,'' Nunez said of the inherent Big Red
fear that cripples North Division teams but fails to impact Texans.
``I think that's a mind-set that's in our subconscious. We may not
talk about it, but it's there ... The northern schools, like
Colorado, put more emphasis on Nebraska than we do. When I was at
Colorado, people were talking about the Nebraska game before
two-a-days. With that goes more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to the advice of Texas coach Mack Brown, who urges
players to ``take the logo off the helmet'' and treat the
Cornhuskers like any other team. That is easier to do, admitted
Texas cornerback Ahmad Brooks, if you haven't been inundated for
years with tales of Nebraska's invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, a sophomore who grew up in Abilene, said he ``wasn't
familiar with the Nebraska mystique'' until he began getting
recruiting letters as a junior in high school.
</P>
<P>
   But how long was he aware that A&AMP;M and Texas played the sport at
a high level?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a boy,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Others downplay the native Texan angle as a factor in adopting a
fearless approach when facing Nebraska. Texas defensive end Cedric
Woodard, a Sweeney resident, said it boils down to ``being lucky
and being prepared.'' Texas A&AMP;M strong safety Michael Jameson, who
grew up in Killeen, cites the need for self-confidence and a
short-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go out there scared of Nebraska's tradition,''
Jameson said. ``On that day, tradition goes away. It's just a
matter of who makes the plays on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history suggests players who carry a Texas driver's
license have the best chance of looking past Nebraska's glowing
credentials on game day. Such a development validates a theory
lofted in 1996 by Rice coach Ken Hatfield in the wake of the
Southwest Conference breakup.
</P>
<P>
   When a new league is formed, Hatfield said: ``You've got to
establish your position in the conference pecking order, instead of
having it grandfathered in like in the past. You're playing four or
five new teams and none of them are awed by your mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day, Longhorns and Aggies might arrive wide-eyed and
trembling for showdowns against Cornhuskers, just like Jayhawks and
Cyclones. But not this year. The Big Red mystique has yet to take
root in points south of the Red River.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON: NORTH MIGHT SEPARATE SOUTH'S CLOSE CONTENDERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the South Division race in a virtual dead heat among five
schools, the teams that could play the greatest role in determining
the outcome might not be listed in the South standings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the championship could be impacted heavily by North
Division schools Nebraska and Kansas State. Both the third-ranked
Cornhuskers (6-0, 3-0) and seventh-ranked Wildcats (6-0, 3-0) have
two crossover games remaining against South opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska plays Texas (5-2, 2-1) and Texas A&AMP;M (5-1, 2-1). Kansas
State meets Oklahoma State (3-2, 1-1) and Baylor (1-5, 0-3).
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Texas Tech (3-3, 2-1) and Oklahoma (3-2, 1-1) are
not on the remaining schedules for the league's only Top 10 teams.
Unless upsets occur, the Red Raiders and Sooners figure to pick up
a pivotal game down the stretch, courtesy of Nebraska and Kansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important in this race how you do against the other half
of the league,'' Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``That's why beating
Colorado (last week) was such an important win for us. We've still
got Missouri and Iowa State left to play from the North Division.
They're tough teams. But it's not like playing Nebraska and Kansas
State.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown, whose lone league loss came against
Kansas State, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years, you hit the schedule right. Some years, you
don't,'' Brown said. ``Obviously, it's not a plus for us this year.
You'd have to say the teams playing both Nebraska and Kansas State
have the toughest road.''
</P>
<P>
   Among South schools, only Texas and Oklahoma State play the
Cornhuskers and Wildcats.
QUICK HITS PIVOTAL WEEK
</P>
<P>
   A clouded South Division title race could swing in any of five
directions this week, depending on Saturday's outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five contending teams, each with one loss in the
league standings, two are underdogs against top-10 opponents
(Texas, Oklahoma State). Two square off in a potential elimination
match (Texas A&AMP;M, Oklahoma). Only Texas Tech is a clear favorite,
and the Red Raiders have yet to win consecutive games heading into
a contest at Baylor that follows a victory against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next week will open a lot of eyes,'' Tech coach Spike
Dykes said. ``A lot of different scenarios could unfold. When the
smoke clears on Sunday, we'll have a little better idea what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said: ``This is a week where you either
take a step forward or you take a big step back. This is a big week
for everyone in the South Division.'' PRIMARY SECONDARY
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska defensive backs wear T-shirts beneath their uniforms
emblazoned with the slogan ``Secondary to None.'' They rank third
nationally in pass efficiency defense, allowing opponents a 42
percent completion rate. The Cornhuskers have 20 pass breakups and
nine interceptions and have permitted only four touchdowns passes
in six games.
</P>
<P>
   How good are they?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out this week,'' said cornerback Ralph Brown,
looking ahead to a matchup against a Texas passing game that
averages 305.4 yards per outing. ``This will be the biggest test
we've faced all year, but I think we'll be up to the challenge. We
want to show people we really do have the best secondary in the
country.'' nn

   What Alfred Hitchock understood with ``The Birds,'' and Steven
Spielberg understood with ``Jaws,'' is that when you make a ``when
animals attack'' movie, it helps to have humans who are at least as
interesting as the animals. ``Bats,'' like too many other films,
forgets this, giving us stock characters _ stolid sheriff (Lou
Diamond Phillips), spunky zoologist (Dina Meyer), her wisecracking
assistant (Leon, in a role that's a little too ``feets, do yo'
stuff'' for my taste), earnest Centers for Disease Control official
(Carlos Jacott) and mad scientist (Bob Gunton) _ battling
computer-generated imagery and really ugly puppets. The scientist's
nefarious experiments result in hordes of genetically altered bats
attacking a small Texas town (why do these things always happen
away from population centers?).
</P>
<P>
   It's as trashy as it sounds, but it's also kind of entertaining,
in a turn-off-your-brain sort of way. Louis Morneau directs with
enough play-with-camera style to make you think he has some
promise, until you find out that he already has a half-dozen
straight-to-video titles to his credit. The bat attacks are pretty
cool, though _ and the bats, with their screeching, have the best
dialogue in the movie. Filmed in Utah, despite the Texas setting.
89 min. PG-13 (strong language, violence, ugly bats, guano)

NEW BRUNSWICK OFFERS FLOOR FOR A SLOW DANCE WITH SALMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Every fall I buy a ticket to dance with salmon.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Robert Dewell, my fishing partner since
childhood and now of Cooperstown, and I pack a rental with all the
gear and clothes we need for a week of fly fishing for Atlantic
salmon on one or another Canadian river.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, we've been joined by Frank McCaffrey of New
Scotland. For years we would head for the little-known Stewiacke in
upper Nova Scotia and be virtually alone on a 20-mile river. When
that precious gem closed due to a mysterious lack of returning wild
fish nearly a decade ago, as have most Bay of Fundy rivers, we
moved with an increasing sense of the ominous to others in the
province. We tried the East, the West, St. Mary's, many others.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they closed, as well, for the same reason. That left
us only the muscular Margaree far out on Cape Breton Island, Nova
Scotia's last, best hope for preserving a once proud and prolific
salmon fishing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But even there, the fishing pressure has become so intense for
often a limited run of fish, that civility and cordiality have been
sorely stressed. Too many fishermen, too few fish. It's not much
fun dancing on the Margaree these days.
</P>
<P>
   So during the '90s we switched our affections to New Brunswick's
main branch of the Miramichi.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly a dance we go to, although years ago each of us
learned painfully that a ticket never guarantees even one partner.
Every river offers a different symphony as background, a blend of
rushing currents and incessant winds. It is deliciously lonely.
Waist deep in 41-degree water, fighting to maintain balance, hour
after hour we cast over and over into a promising seam of pitch
black water with tensed muscles, waiting. Waiting for a partner.
</P>
<P>
   A salmon's ``take'' on the small wet fly free-floating down
river is usually unmistakable. It's as if the fly hits a brick
wall. The line goes taut, there usually are a couple of quick head
shakes, and soon after the salmon goes airborne, tailing along the
surface. Over and over, dancing on its tail. Then running upstream
or down with a power and purpose as amazing to feel and marvel at
the hundredth time as the first.
</P>
<P>
   Too soon, it's over, although by the clock it might be half an
hour. Either the salmon breaks loose, or we release it, coaxing it
back to full strength before letting go.
</P>
<P>
   As the late Lee Wulff said years ago, an Atlantic salmon is too
precious a commodity to be caught only once. That's also become the
law in North America. Big salmon, the breeders, must be released,
there are so few of them anymore. Some small, one-sea-run salmon,
called grilse, may be kept, but most fishermen I know release those
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Because we're all feeling a sense of doom settling over Atlantic
salmon, and we desperately want to keep the dance going as long as
we can.
</P>
<P>
   From any perspective, the facts are deeply discouraging. In the
last two decades, 80 percent of the Atlantic salmon stock in Europe
and North America have simply disappeared, and in general that
decline continues. The why of it is mostly a mystery, although
there is no lack of suspects, from long-haul commercial nets in the
ocean, to disease brought in by huge fish farms, to natural
predators such as seals, cod, and stripers. And always, and
especially, us. Greedy fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so desperate right now in Maine that Trout
Unlimited and the Atlantic Salmon Federation are calling for
immediate, emergency listing of indigenous wild salmon as an
endangered species. Otherwise, the prediction is they will be
extinct in as little as two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Our anecdotal report from the Miramichi this year is cautiously
optimistic, or at least, not wholly negative. We hooked and landed
fish every day, which constitutes an excellent fishing trip. A
total of 15, mostly grilse. That's much better than the past two
years. And we saw markedly more salmon this year, rolling on the
surface and flashing through, because we arrived, fortunately, well
after the disastrous drought months of July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, salmon have the option of hanging out in bays until
there's enough water in a river to make a spawning run. We
benefited from good water, and excellent guides.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big commercial fishing camps catering to well-heeled
sports from the states took a shellacking again this year. There
were fewer this year than last. No water, no fish during prime
time. Even small operations we encountered are openly saying what
was unspeakable a few years ago. There is talk about closing cabins
and camps along this majestic river on beats that have been fished
with the devotion of a religion every year for centuries. No water,
no fish. No point.
</P>
<P>
   I did hook and land a bright hen of about 30 pounds, according
to my conservative guide, a torpedo of a fish that slammed a 12
black bear. She danced and danced, and kept me running for the
better part of an hour. At the end, I was more exhausted than she
was. We had the best time.
</P>
<P>
   God willing, we'll both be back next year. Wouldn't miss the
dance for anything.

HAPPY ENDING FOR A FRUSTRATED FISHERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Strange happenings are commonplace on a fishing
stream, although few of them feature a reasonably happy ending even
for the fish, as this one does.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Silverman was fly fishing for giant chinooks with three
buddies on Lake Ontario's Salmon River last Wednesday, along the
privately owned Douglaston run. The fishing was good, at least for
his companions, each of whom hooked up muscular fish during what
seems to be the last big spurt of king salmon coming into the
river. But none of this rubbed off on Silverman, who had a
frustrating day of misses. Then again, although he is a lifelong
spin fisher, he is only a beginning fly fisher, and there is the
learning curve to get through.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was trying too hard, or he was just plain sloppy, which
he couldn't afford to be because he wasn't wearing spiked Korkers
underfoot. The Salmon is a river slippery as goose spit on the best
day, and on this occasion a sudden drop in temperature loosed algae
that made every rock a bowling ball.
</P>
<P>
   In his eagerness to get out into four feet of water to cast to
some moving fish, Silverman took a royal header. It's instinct to
throw your arms out in front to break the fall, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, an Orvis DXR reel, Orvis fly line and Heritage 8
wt. rod all went sailing into the current and disappeared. Big
bucks. Fruitlessly, the four searched the river bottom for hours
and couldn't find the rig.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Silverman was one dejected puppy on that ride home, and told
his wife when he walked in the door that it was the worst day of
his life. But then on the weekend he got a call from a chiropractor
from Queens, who found the rod and reel and wanted to know how to
get the stuff back to Silverman, who had wisely left his name and
address at the check-in booth at Douglaston.
</P>
<P>
   It was like Silverman's buddy, Patrick Sisti, said in
consolation while they were searching: ``You just want to pray a
fly fisherman finds your rod, because he or she can understand how
you feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If just getting a top-end rig back from a stranger isn't odd
enough, consider what the chiropractor had to report. It seems
Silverman had his pink egg fly attached to his hook keeper when it
went flying. But when the rod was found, all the line was out plus
a lot of the backing. The fly was gone, and so was a foot of the
tippet.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is the fly came loose from its guard, a Chinook
scarfed it up and went for a merry fin down river. The fish finally
snapped off, which is common enough even when a rod is being
well-played by a human at the other end. Which means that as a
final indignity to the day for Silverman, the only time a salmon
found his fly appealing was when he wasn't fishing it, which
doesn't say much for his technique.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe it does.

`BODY SHOTS' TAKES AIM AT PRURIENT INTERESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody involved in the advertising of ``Body Shots'' actually
had the nerve to come up with the tagline, ``There are movies that
define every decade ...''. Yeah, there are, but ``Body Shots''
isn't one of them, unless you've spent the decade with your nose
buried in magazine sex-advice columns.
</P>
<P>
   This overdirected, pretentious film has about as much depth as
an average ``Friends'' episode, although come to think of it,
``Friends'' is more decade-defining, even with its well-chronicled
lack of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Let's cut the malarkey, OK? What ``Body Shots'' is about is sex,
baby. Its eight characters talk about its various forms, often in
annoyingly staged faux interviews during which they directly
address the camera. They not only talk, they take action, and
director Michael Cristofer _ a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
who should know better _ spends a good deal of time showing them in
the act. He may be after a ``mature'' movie that says that we're
all desperate for love or at least a connection, but what he
delivers often looks like soft-core porn.
</P>
<P>
   Cristofer and screenwriter David McKenna _ who wrote the
similarly oversimplified but much better-executed ``American
History X'' _ create superficial characters, all good-looking
people who, after about five minutes, seem about as desirable as a
case of pinkeye. The message, apparently, is that looks can be
deceiving. Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   The movie sets them up in teams _ girls vs. boys _ who
rendezvous at a club, pair in assorted ways, and wind up having an
eventful night.
</P>
<P>
   The central event happens to Michael (Jerry O'Connell), a pro
football player, and Sara (Tara Reid of ``American Pie,'' a much
more honest movie about sex), an aspiring actress. After he spirits
her away from her nice-guy prospective boyfriend, they go back to
her place, and she later accuses him of date rape. Cristofer and
McKenna linger on this plot thread, with Michael and Sara each
telling their versions of the story with the movie graphically
depicting each side. It's here that the movie takes a turn from
shallow to offensive; even as it cops out by refusing to take a
stand, it still has a lot of ``Well, she asked for it'' in its
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   There's a couple that we're meant to root for, played by Sean
Patrick Flanery and Amanda Peet, each of whom takes a turn as
surrogate counselor/attorney with their friends entangled in the
rape case. But the movie keeps them apart for so long, it doesn't
allow us to become involved in their budding romance. Instead, it
dwells on scenes of back-alley sex and cartoonish bondage among its
other principal characters.
</P>
<P>
   The movie would be a lot less irritating if Cristofer and
McKenna weren't so convinced that they were saying something
profound, or if it its actors didn't look so much like they bought
into the baloney. At times, you wonder how they said some of their
lines without bursting out laughing. If you met any of their
characters in real life, it would probably take only a couple of
heartbeats to spot them for the phonies they are. So why waste a
couple of hours with 'em?

`BOYS' IS ALL GROWN UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hilary Swank, the star of ``Boys Don't Cry,'' represents a
peculiar kind of culture clash. Slender and hipless, she resembles
the wiry, androgynous trailer trash whom Larry Clark (''Kids'')
stared at through his camera lens and Calvin Klein employed as
underwear models a few years ago. Swank, who glowered at Mr. Miyagi
as ``The Next Karate Kid'' a few years back, looks like Matt Damon,
but the Matt Damon of ``Courage Under Fire'' _ toothy and
emaciated. Astonishingly, she also resembles Teena Brandon, the
real-life person upon whom Swank's role is based. Brandon was
dissatisfied with her life as a girl and decided to live as a boy:
She bound her breasts, cropped her hair and switched her name
around, becoming Brandon Teena. With her happy lope of a walk, this
Brandon Teena is ripe for experience _ she comes across as nothing
so much as hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' displays a unique intimacy. Director Kimberly
Peirce makes the movie seem both intensely felt and modest in
scale, a story of a small-town kid with epic feelings. (It's
reminiscent of ``East of Eden.'') The women communicate in
unactorly ways; the camera often seems to be a voyeur in the girls'
locker room, which is exactly what Brandon is.
</P>
<P>
   Teena's openness is just what these small-town girls want;
they're tired of the drunken macho louts around them. Especially
Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who comes to life as she falls for Brandon _
she desperately wants an alternative to the bad-tempered John
(Peter Sarsgaard). But Brandon has a wild streak, too, if only
because she wants to experience life as a male.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the story may be a little disappointed by the
simplification of Peirce, who co-wrote the film with Andy Bienen.
The Brandon Teena of ``Boys Don't Cry'' is an innocent, a sexual
martyr in a world she never made; the real story is a bit more
complicated. The real Brandon Teena was a predator who read
people's weaknesses and preyed upon them. She used the feminine
side of herself to gain the trust of the young women she dated and
used. It's a fascinating story, and the movie, while compelling,
strays far from its source. (The Brandon Teena documentary of a few
years ago is being repeated this month on Showtime.)
</P>
<P>
   But Peirce is angling for an emotional clarity, which she gets.
Brandon is as turned on by getting into costume and posing in front
of the mirror as a guy, as she is by women. Peirce is also after
emotional power _ the fear about what could happen if Brandon is
exposed in front of the angry John and his tag-along buddy (Brendan
Sexton III). We get a taste of it early on, when Brandon is run out
of her hometown after her imposture was revealed. And she was giddy
over it, pixilated by the tempest she stirred up. She relishes the
troublemaking aspect of being a man _ she gets into a fight and
rubs the bruised side of her face as if it were a brand new car and
she were examining the curves. ``Boys Don't Cry'' is the eruption
of a new star _ Swank _ and the debut of a major director. Peirce's
capacity for layering important psychological detail and building
to a climax shows intelligence and willfulness. I can't think of
another American director of the past few years who has exploded
onto the screen in this way, especially with such an honest
depiction of women. Even a woman who wants to be a man is still a
woman.

LOOKING BACK, POPE PAUL VI WAS RIGHT ON CONTRACEPTION

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Confession time. I was brought up Catholic and attended weekly
Mass through my college years, but I became a Protestant at age 22,
back in 1963, in part because I did not believe in the Catholic
Church's position on birth control.
 &HT;    As a Time correspondent in South America, I saw massive poverty
of families living in shacks, in part because they had too many
children. The population of the world was already 3 billion, and
the population bomb seemed explosive.
 &HT;    It seemed reasonable for families to plan the size and spacing
of their children. I could see no practical difference between
artificial contraception and natural family planning, except that
NFP was less effective.
 &HT;    When Pope Paul VI issued his encyclical Humanae Vitae, (Of Human
Life) in 1968, many had hoped that he would legalize the already
widespread practice of using ''The Pill.'' When he reaffirmed
traditional Catholic opposition, millions of Catholics flouted his
position.
 &HT;    By 1977, a Gallup Poll found that 73 percent of Catholics said
one could be a good Catholic and ignore the pope. I thought it more
honest to be a Protestant.
 &HT;    The population of the world is now 6 billion, and I have changed
my mind about birth control. In retrospect, Paul's Humanae Vitae
was prophetic in saying that widespread use of contraception would
lead to ''conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of
morality.''
 &HT;    Certainly, that's happened. Since the Pill began to be sold in
1960, divorces have tripled, out-of-wedlock births jumped from
224,000 to 1.2 million, abortions doubled, and cohabitation soared
10-fold from 430,000 to 4.2 million.
 &HT;    The pope predicted man would lose respect for woman, considering
her ''as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment, and no longer as
his respected and beloved companion.'' Surely the ''Playboy
Philosophy'' became widely accepted.
 &HT;    Ironically, feminists have attacked the Catholic Church for its
alleged disregard for women, but the church in Humanae Vitae
``identified and rejected sexual exploitation of women years before
that message entered the cultural mainstream,'' writes Denver
Archbishop Charles Chaput.
 &HT;    One sad result: 40 percent of U.S. children do not live in homes
with their father. Never has there been such an abandonment by
fathers of the women they impregnated and their kids.
 &HT;    Pope Paul also predicted that contraception would mislead human
beings into thinking they had unlimited control over their own
bodies. Indeed, the Supreme Court's decision to allow
contraceptives to be sold was cited as justification in a later
decision legalizing abortion. Now scientists are at work to clone
human beings, which Congress has refused to outlaw.
 &HT;    Contraception is constantly trotted out as the answer to
abortion and illegitimacy, with $715 million spent by the Federal
Government on it despite a rise of out-of-wedlock births from 4
percent to 32 percent of American babies born.
 &HT;    Isn't a generation of failure enough to question these outlays?
 &HT;    Why has contraception induced lower rates of morality?
 &HT;    Throughout history, some have committed adultery. ''However, a
tremendous deterrent from doing so, if not the main deterrent in
most cases, was the fear of pregnancy. Hmm, now what might happen
if this natural deterrent were to be taken away through widespread
availability and cultural acceptance of contraception?'' asks
Christopher West, the Denver archdiocese's Marriage &AMP; Family Life
Director. Of course, infidelity increases.
 &HT;    Similarly, the fear of pregnancy limited premarital sex. Take
that fear away, millions more will have sex out of wedlock. And
when pregnancy occurs, more resort to abortion or have babies
out-of-wedlock. Those children grow up in fatherless homes, and are
more likely to become sexually promiscuous as they grow older, or
criminal compared to those nurtured in intact homes. The sins of
each generation are compounded in the next.
 &HT;    Even evangelicals are reconsidering their once solid support of
contraception. The Family Research Council just published an
article, ''The Empty Promise of Contraception,'' which notes that
Japan is about to legalize the sale of the Pill. The impact ''may
be more ominous for this traditional and family-oriented country
than public officials realize,'' predicts Teresa Wagner.
 &HT;    One surprising reason: ''The Pill today prevents even fewer
pregnancies than it prevented 30 years ago.'' The Pill used to
suppress ovulation through a heavy dose of a synthetic estrogen.
But that often caused nausea and weight gain. So drug companies
reduced estrogen and added progesterone, which is less effective.
 &HT;    Result? Half of all pregnancies are still unintended in the U.S.
as ''18 percent of couples who use condoms and 12 percent who take
the Pill become pregnant within two years,'' reports Family
Planning Perspectives. Half of those seeking abortions were using
birth control!
 &HT;    Pope Paul VI predicted much of this back in 1968. Even Catholics
should pay attention.

NICOLAS CAGE'S PALE-FACED PERFORMANCE HAUNTS SCORSESE FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Bringing Out The Dead,'' Nicolas Cage looks so exhausted,
even his eyes have a five o'clock shadow. He's Frank, a beaten-down
emergency medical technician, as desperate as many of the junkies
he treats. Except Frank gets high on saving lives, and when we meet
him he's chasing down this life-sustaining and transcendent buzz.
``Saving lives is like falling in love,'' he murmurs in the
narration that carries the film. Without the rush, he's the color
of parchment. Frank's haunted because in the sea of ghosts that
washes over the night streets, he sees the sullen baby face of a
girl he couldn't save. The few times he dozes off, she haunts his
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This is director Martin Scorsese's return to the streets of New
York, and he gives ``Dead'' a sense of place that's unmistakably
Manhattan. (The streets are so slick from being hosed down, you'd
think they were trying to keep it from spontaneously bursting into
flame. Given Scorsese's intensity, that's not outside the realm of
possibility.) ``Dead'' was written by Paul Schrader, who gave us
``Taxi Driver'' 23 years ago, and it's a movie about hope, if not
optimism, although it's soaked with the traditional Scorsese thirst
for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Frank drags himself through the movie in a numb haze _ he can't
sleep _ so the movie is jacked up for him, with a VH1 soundtrack to
suggest the synapses firing and misfiring in his head. It's also
the signature of Scorsese, perhaps the world's most exhibitionistic
director, who's working here with one of the most flamboyant of
cinematographers: Robert Richardson, who worked with Oliver Stone
on some of his best-known films, including ``Natural Born
Killers.'' When you add Cage (referred to by a fellow star as ``the
world's most over-the-top actor'') to the mix, it sounds like a
lethal cocktail. The images pop from the screen; often, people are
backlighted by street lamps or delineated in shadows. But Cage is a
weary blur, his eyes fried to a crackly crunch, so he doesn't get
to fall back on his quick, tantrum-y bleats.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is carried by its supporting actors. Solid-as-a-rock
(and big-as-a-boulder) John Goodman is the closest-to-normal
partner Frank has, and he's as goofy as a fruit bat. Ving Rhames,
sporting a perm of black patent leather, is a preacher, a fighter
and a lover given to comic rants right out of an old Robin Harris
routine (''If you see me with a white woman, I'm holding her for
the police.'') And Tom Sizemore's eyes gleam with malice. He lives
to fight, especially with a freaked-out wraith of a junkie played
by Marc Anthony. You know it's the eve of the millennium when Cage
is the straight man in a movie, as he is here and was in ``8mm.''
</P>
<P>
   Cage's Frank is like a biblical figure, attempting to fight a
plague on his home _ a type of heroin called Red Death. He's torn
about trying to keep alive the father of a woman he falls for
(Patricia Arquette), a man who cries out, in a voice only Frank can
hear, that he doesn't want to suffer anymore. He's a rather
heavy-handed manifestation of Frank's conscience, representing the
girl Frank couldn't help.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it must be horrible to be Martin Scorsese, with
every film pounced upon by people waiting to judge it as a work of
art. ``Bringing Out the Dead'' doesn't labor to offer new insight
on the human condition. Not even from the screenwriter, who must've
been attracted to Joe Connelly's handsomely sculpted, grim dream of
a novel because it's close to areas Schrader's covered before.
Scorsese seems relieved to take a little pressure off himself. The
result is an enjoyable, if minor work, full of jokes: Scorsese is
the voice of a dispatcher, as is Queen Latifah; the wives of the
star (Arquette) and the writer (Marybeth Hurt, as a hectoring
admitting nurse) are in it; and a fireworks scene is a grisly
parody of ``Manhattan.'' With his perfunctory artistry, Scorsese
seems to be using this film to take a breath of fresh air.

`THE BEST MAN': PARTY, BUT BE TRUE TO YOUR SWEETHEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end)) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the genial ensemble film ``The Best Man,'' Taye Diggs puts on
glasses to play a Chicago novelist whose book has been selected for
Oprah Winfrey's book club. He also appears in a candlelit bathtub
covered with rose petals, since the movie doesn't forget to get its
priorities straight. The main point about the novel written by
Harper Stewart (Diggs) is that it is called ``Unfinished
Business.'' Harper has some. It seems that he closely modeled one
character on an old flame named Jordan (Nia Long) who once kissed
Harper to the tune of a Stevie Wonder song when they were in
college. ``Jordan's the best girlfriend you never had,'' one of his
buddies remarks.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with minimal surprise that the film finds Jordan at a
New York wedding that Harper also attends. (See title.) The two
take a walk in Central Park, during which Jordan, now an ambitious
career woman, pronounces herself ``a horny nutbasket.'' Soon
afterward she lures Harper into a clinch, and the film emphasizes
the crucifix behind them. This is a reminder that back home,
probably cleaning the petals out of the tub, is Robin (Sanaa
Lathan), to whom he has promised to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Malcolm D. Lee, ``The Best Man'' is another
demonstration that current movies about upscale black characters
have much more traditional values than ones about catty white
teen-agers. Marital fidelity is its main issue, since it involves
the imminent marriage of a once-philandering star athlete (Morris
Chestnut) to his longtime sweetheart (Monica Calhoun). Now that he
is ready to renounce his wild past (mention is made of ``those
honeys at the Cotton Bowl''), this guy likes boasting about his
fiancee's virtue. One of the film's minor messages is that it's
dangerous to marry a jealous football player.
</P>
<P>
   But its major message is an affirmation of marriage, fidelity
and religious faith, with an enjoyable group of the groom's friends
(Harold Perrineau, Terrence Howard) to hash over these issues.
Meanwhile, there is time for them to tease the literary Harper as
``Richard Wrong'' and ``Langston Snooze'' and, of course, to party.
The film's cure for many ills is celebrating and dancing. Despite
the story's underlying wholesomeness, it thus has an excuse to work
lap dancers into the plot.

</P>
<P>
   After tucking our toddler into bed one recent evening, my
exhausted husband commented, ``I remember what I was doing 30 years
ago tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I can barely remember what I was doing 30 minutes ago,
this caught my attention. ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, 30 years last night, actually. October 15, 1969. I was
at a big protest of the Vietnam War in Washington. A month later,
another protest. After that, everything broke loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans remember 1969 for two events: Neil Armstrong walking
on the moon and Woodstock. But 1969 was also a crucible for the
antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   Although people had protested the war throughout the decade, by
1969 antiwar sentiment became increasingly difficult to ignore. The
largest cohort of baby-boomers turned eighteen; Richard Nixon had
just taken office. The clash between protesters and establishment
could no longer be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The American experience of Vietnam is as varied as the memories
of those who lived through it. Politicians, soldiers, reporters,
parents, college students, schoolchildren. North and South; black
and white and brown; rich and poor. Whether or not one served in
Vietnam, we all fought the war together. It was waged on Asian
battlefields, American campuses and the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   And in church.
</P>
<P>
   Few events have transformed American religion as did the Vietnam
War. And few have been more difficult to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the Yale historian Sydney Ahlstrom wrote of the times,
``The sharp crescendo of social strife seemed to demonstrate that
the time-honored structures of American church life were irrelevant
to the country's actual condition-- churchgoing America came to be
regardedas an obstacle to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the 1970s, traditional religion seemed completely
outmoded, a relic of an earlier, more innocent age. God appeared
dead. One more casualty of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the late University of California professor Walter
Capps identified two major religious trends resulting from
Vietnam-- the ``revitalization of conservative religion'' and ``the
new spirituality.'' Pent-up patriotism fuelled a backlash against
the 60s radicalism and formed the basis for the religious right.
People went back to church. But they did not return to traditional
ones. Instead, they joined conservative churches in droves,places
that enshrined romanticized, pre-Vietnam views of family and
country.
</P>
<P>
   Capps described ``the new spirituality'' as ``the rise of
contemplative religion, the daily practice of meditationand even
the new and perceptibly strong interest in mysticism.'' This ``new
spirituality'' was more concerned with self than community-- ``an
appropriate response'' since traditional community had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   With older structures in chaos, a diffuse interest in
spirituality replaced institutional religion. God was not dead. God
had only changed his address.
</P>
<P>
   Both impulses were aspects of the American soul. One honored
tradition, the Bible, God and country; the other reflected
individualism, experimentation, ambiguity and questioning. These
differing religious interpretations of Vietnam led to a 20-year
cultural war-- ``a quarrel that has not yet been resolved'' at the
time Capps wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But we are 30 yearsand a generationaway from 1969. Despite
persistent bickering by some politicians and pundits, the quarrel
has been largely resolved. It was resolved by default and
demographics, by an aging baby-boom generation and the
coming-of-age of their own children, Generation X. For the most
part, these two groups have embraced some form of the ``new
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, it looked as if the religious right's patriotic
``return to normalcy'' would prevail. It has not. Conservative
evangelicals have realized that they are a distinct minority-- a
large one but still a minoritywhose views do not resonate with
contemporary values and opinions on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the venerable evangelical magazine ``Christianity Today''
recently posed the question, ``Is the Religious Right Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new spirituality'' of the Vietnam era has become
mainstream. Contemplative, personal, mystical, eclectic. Some
traditional religious institutions -- Ahlstrom's ``irrelevant''
ones-- have adapted this ethos and have begun to experience new
growth. The baby-boomers, so shaped by the first wave of ``new
spirituality,'' now lead America's churches and synagogues. They
are quietly reforming the nature of the institutions they once
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But much of American spirituality remains outside institutions.
The powerful impulses toward alternative religious expression and
mystical spirituality are consumer-oriented, Web-accessible, and
seeker-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The pull is so strong, and the new consensus around these values
so real, that most younger Americans imbibe this spirit. The break
with the past, even among very conservative religious people, is
surprisingly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years. A generation. Gone is traditional American
religion. We left it in the rice paddies of Vietnamor maybe on the
Mall in Washington one long-ago autumn.

`BRINGING OUT THE DEAD': A SCORSESE DEVIL HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prop garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen helps set the
early-'90s tone for Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead.''
Though his latest film explores one more urban inferno and
colorfully reaffirms Scorsese's role as the Dante of the Cinema,
creating its air of nocturnal torment took some doing. After all,
New York City has had its cosmetic makeover, and the filmmaker is
rightly regarded as a national treasure. Yet old demons die hard,
at least on this film's evidence. So Scorsese is still trawling
Manhattan's underworld, looking for the devil he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' based on a scorchingly vivid 1998
novel by Joe Connelly, describes the life of a night-shift
paramedic encountering one bizarre crisis after another and very
nearly stretched to the breaking point. ``I'd always had
nightmares, but now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep,'' says
Frank Pierce (played soulfully by Nicolas Cage), although Travis
Bickle of ``Taxi Driver'' might have said the same. In fact,
Frank's ambulance carries ``Taxi Driver'' as dangerously heavy
baggage when it makes its nightly rounds. Twenty-five years later,
New York's neon lights whiz past Scorsese's camera much faster, but
the sights on the tour have barely changed.
</P>
<P>
   The essence has: the loner who sought violent release in ``Taxi
Driver'' has become a lonely guy seeking a state of grace.
Faithfully and succinctly adapted from Connelly's book by Paul
Schrader (who also revisits his ``Taxi Driver'' triumph here), the
film tells of a man driven wild by real horrors, not paranoid
imaginings. Early in the film Frank and one of his several sharply
etched partners (John Goodman) answer a call from the Burke family
and find the senior Burke apparently a corpse. In an eloquently
suspenseful sequence that illustrates Scorsese's utter command of
his medium, Frank succeeds in restoring his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like too many of his struggles with death, this proves to be a
Pyrrhic victory. ``After a while, I grew to understand that my life
was less about saving lives than about bearing witness,'' Frank
latter says. ``I was a grief mop. It was enough that I simply
showed up.'' So Burke winds up in limbo at the hellish, overcrowded
hospital that the film evokes ruefully well. And his daughter Mary,
played by Patricia Arquette, becomes an important presence in
Frank's life. The film is structured to follow his nightly routine
over the course of several days, so that it repeatedly returns to
the emergency ward with new patients. Mary's vigil for her father
keeps her there too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' becomes an intense, volatile film full
of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. It also becomes an uncertain mix
of moods, appropriately manic to suit Frank's stress; there are
times when he doesn't know whether to laugh or cry, and audiences
won't, either. One dizzying subplot (featuring Cliff Curtis) leads
Frank to the terrace of a high-rise building where welder's sparks
shoot off against the city skyline and a man is impaled on a
wrought iron fence. ``Isn't that beautiful?'' the man asks as Frank
tries to save him. The movie's furious contradictions and its
gallows glory are perfectly captured in that moment.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative structure, revisiting the same characters and
hospital over the course of ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' has a
deliberate but wearing way of chasing its own tail. But this is
still a bustling, impassioned film with much to recommend it.
Scorsese wrote the book on darkly evocative urban visions, and now
he adds a new chapter; he deploys his huge visual vocabulary of
camera movements, perspective and motion changes with unparalleled
authority. Cage, with the look of an anguished medieval saint,
gives a fine, haunting performance that makes Frank's spiritual
crisis very real indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In a joyously scene-stealing performance, Ving Rhames turns one
of Frank's partners into comic relief, while Tom Sizemore plays
another as a violent crime waiting to happen. The singer Marc
Anthony proves to be very much the actor Marc Anthony, though his
role as a deranged derelict named Noel is not the stuff of which
heartthrob images are made. The hospital staff, closely based on
Connelly's documentarylike character sketches, includes Mary Beth
Hurt and Aida Turturro and has the attitude and lingo to suit the
setting. ``They're fixed and dilated,'' says a doctor looking into
a patient's pupils. ``This guy's plant food.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arquette's quietly credible performance helps center Frank's
experiences; one of the film's most honest scenes is actually one
in which they share an ambulance ride without sharing a word. And
Dante Ferretti, the production designer, summons Manhattan's West
Side as carefully as he did the Tibet of ``Kundun'' and the Las
Vegas of ``Casino.'' ``Bringing Out the Dead'' was shot by Robert
Richardson, Oliver Stone's frequent cinematographer, who gives it
more than enough speed and variety to get the movie through the
night.

`MOLLY': TAKING THE TEARS OUT OF A POTENTIALLY TEAR-JERKING PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a mentally retarded woman who, thanks to brain surgery,
briefly achieves a state bordering on normalcy, Elisabeth Shue
slowly unfurls through John Duigan's film ``Molly'' like a flower
reaching for the sun. But if Ms. Shue infuses ``Molly'' with a
flicker of joy, her sweetly likable performance is the only
coherent element in a film that has the impersonal feel of a
television drama slapped together in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   In its plot outline, ``Molly'' is so similar to ``Charly,'' the
1968 hit starring Cliff Robertson, that you wonder why no official
credit has been given to the earlier movie or to its source, Daniel
Keyes' novel ``Flowers for Algernon.'' Both films tell essentially
the same story of someone who, through modern medical science,
emerges from the shadows of a disability to experience a moment of
euphoric illumination before retreating back into the darkness. But
``Molly'' is so mechanically detached and emotionally void that a
potentially tear-jerking fable is rendered merely stupefying.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Molly, she is discharged from a nursing home
in the care of her brother, Buck (Aaron Eckhart), an advertising
copywriter and boating enthusiast who lives in Venice Beach. Molly
is a formidable handful: curious, clumsy, hyperemotional,
desperately needy and incapable of discharging the must mundane
tasks. One day, after Buck takes Molly to his office and instructs
her to wait in the reception area, she complains about the heat,
pulls off her clothes and barges naked into her brother's meeting.
Buck soon loses his job.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of a risky operation that could increase Molly's
intelligence, Buck persuades his sister to agree to the surgery. At
first the operation appears to have been unsuccessful. Then Molly
begins to show signs of a growing intelligence. Addicted to
television soap operas, she also becomes increasingly interested in
sex. After watching a video of ``Gone With the Wind,'' she
transforms herself into a ludicrous parody of Scarlett O'Hara and
throws herself wildly at Sam (Thomas Jane), her closest friend from
the clinic. As the two embark on a semi-grown-up love affair, Buck
and Susan Brookes, Molly's doctor (Jill Hennessy), also begin
playing footsie.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Ms. Shue (who is no match for Juliette Lewis in a
similar role in ``The Other Sister''), the movie's other
performances are so blank and chilly that the characters never come
to life. As Buck, Eckhart, who was so provocative in two Neil
LeBute films, is gawkily opaque, and Jane's Sam is barely more than
a prop. By the end of ``Molly'' you have the sinking sense that,
except for the star, this was a movie made by people glumly going
through the motions.

`THE CITY': CITIZENS OF POVERTY YEARNING TO BE FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As profoundly as Italian neo-realism has influenced American
movies (where would Martin Scorsese be without Rossellini and De
Sica?), it takes a work like David Riker's smudgy, no-frills film
``The City'' (``La Ciudad'') to remind you of the genre's power in
bringing home the brute Darwinian realities of poor people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Consisting of four vignettes featuring nonprofessional Latin
American actors, this indelible, deeply disquieting film plunges
you onto the streets of some of New York's poorer neighborhoods
where immigrants, many of whom barely speak English, live at the
mercy of exploitative employers and inflexible institutions. Many
have entered the United States illegally to make whatever money
they can to send back home to their desperately poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City,'' which opens Friday in Mahatttan, blurs the line
between documentary and fiction. Instead of a neatly structured
short story, each vignette is a slice of life that follows one or
more characters into a crisis and leaves them with the situation
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of their lives, including their national origins,
often remain sketchy. The stories are connected by scenes in a
neighborhood studio in which one immigrant after another is
photographed against a tropical backdrop. These scenes underscore
the sense of each story being an extension of a snapshot, a
here-and-now portrait of a life in flux.
</P>
<P>
   In the first story, ``Bricks,'' a cluster of Latino men wait
anxiously on a street corner for someone to arrive and hire them as
unskilled laborers. A contractor (Joe Rigano) appears in a truck
and scoops up 10 men, promising each $50 for a day's work. But
after they are deposited by a demolished brick building in a dusty
lot across the Hudson, the terms of employment are revised.
</P>
<P>
   They are promised a measly 15 cents for each brick that is
gathered and cleaned from the pile around the building. Although an
organizer tries to muster some protest, the workers are too
desperate to heed his call. Fights break out. And when a wall
collapses on one laborer, he is dug out of the rubble and work
halts as the others stand vigil over him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Home,'' a young man (Cipriano Garcia) newly arrived in the
city strays into a ``sweet 15'' party and meets a serious young
woman (Letacia Herrera) who turns out to be from the same Mexican
town. Because he has no place to stay, she takes him home to her
uncle's house, and a wary flirtation develops.
</P>
<P>
   But the next morning when he goes to buy some groceries for
breakfast, he can't find his way back. As the camera peers up at
buildings that more or less look alike, the film conveys the
panicky feeling of being completely lost in an intimidating urban
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The title character of ``The Puppeteer'' is a homeless street
performer (Jose Rabelo) suffering from tuberculosis who lives with
his young daughter in a battered old station wagon, illegally
parked on city property and crammed with their belongings. Having
been told that every child in the city is guaranteed an education,
the puppeteer, who has refused to stay in a city shelter because of
contagious diseases, attempts to enroll his daughter in school but
is unable to produce a document or receipt to prove he lives in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Seamstress,'' the final and most politically incendiary
vignette, a young woman (Silvia Goiz) who works in a sweatshop
where no one has been paid for several weeks, receives a letter
from home with the news that her daughter has fallen ill and needs
$400 for an operation. When she pleads with her bosses for her back
pay, she is threatened with dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to ``Bricks,'' her fellow workers rally around her
in a spontaneous work stoppage. The scenes in the factory of tense,
grim-faced managers bullying the terrified workers are simply blood
chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City'' doesn't go out of its way to pull your
heartstrings, but its understatement makes it all the more
devastating. The anxious, careworn faces of downtrodden people who
have no choice but to continue as best they can convey their plight
more powerfully than any words.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will recognize these faces. There are tens of
thousands of them. They're only too glad to do our dirty work.

ON THE CHEAP: PROLIFIC PRODUCER DAVID E. KELLEY GOES
OVERBOARD  WITH SEX AND SCHLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new hallmarks of television are shock and titillation, and
even a producer and writer as talented as David E. Kelley is
susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently overextended with a batch of TV series and feature
films, Kelley seems to be turning to cheap tricks to keep his
projects afloat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same man who, just one month ago, achieved a
television first by winning the Emmys for best drama (``The
Practice'') and best comedy (``Ally McBeal''). But the strain is
showing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week on ``Chicago Hope,'' a show co-executive produced by
Kelley, a shabby little piece of network history was recorded when
the doctor played by Mark Harmon uttered the dreaded ``s'' word. It
was utterly gratuitous and probably calculated to attract
attention. The show gained half a ratings point over its season
average.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the heavily promoted season premiere of ``Ally
McBeal'' _ the Fox promos crow that ``the only thing more shocking
than the first five minutes is the way it ends!'' _ is an episode
called ``Car Wash.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``Car Wash'' because, in those first five minutes,
Ally (series star Calista Flockhart) disrobes and has sex in a car
wash. Ally swings into action in the rinse section, to be exact.
Her partner is a total stranger played by guest star Jason Gedrick.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ally rhapsodizes about another TV taboo, the ``f'' word,
though she never says it. ``That's what we were doing,'' she tells
one of her legal colleagues, John Cage (Peter MacNicol). ``And
that's what I want to do to him again, that vulgar verb.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is just one of several sexual themes in Monday's
season opener, which Kelley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   MacNicol's character worries that he's lost his sexual
``rhythm'' after his lover, Nelle Porter (Portia de Rossi), wants
to have phone sex with him. And two female characters, launching a
law practice, audition prospective male employees by ordering them
to undress.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kelley's been away from the Boston legal world too long.
</P>
<P>
   A story line on ``The Practice'' last week involved a man
accused of exposing himself. Because his attribute didn't match the
``sad, pathetic little penis'' described by the victim, the
defendant exposed himself in front of the judge and jury to flaunt
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops,'' another Kelley co-production, most recently featured
a political candidate caught in flagrante delicto on a sex tape.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's personal participation varies in these shows and in the
half-hour ``Ally,'' his fifth network series. He's believed to be
most directly involved in ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the other story line on ``The Practice'' this past
Sunday was a powerful, albeit sensational, look at a famed trial
lawyer (James Whitmore) who is senile and accused of murdering his
wife. But you can't watch his shows without realizing that Kelley
has gone beyond sex and shock as judicious components of
high-caliber TV. They're becoming his stock-in-trade _ a telltale
sign that his creative tank is approaching empty.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, with Kelley's workload. Not only does he have five
series on TV but he also had two films in theaters this year,
``Lake Placid'' and ``Mystery, Alaska.'' (Kelley appears to be
doing his prestigious work on TV and slumming in the movies.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' is where it's most conspicuous that Kelley is
spread too thin. Judging by Monday's season premiere, that show has
drifted free of any plausible moorings.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving your car and stripping naked to have sex with a stranger
in a car wash? Lawyers ordering job applicants to take off their
shirts and shake their behinds? Ally also stops a wedding, three
times.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might add that Kelley stretches credibility when Ally
gets wet in the car wash. Flockhart could probably pass through
bone dry.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a show about a single, neurotic young
lawyer making her way in the professional world. But it's
practically entered the realm of erotic fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside ``Ally McBeal's'' comedy classification, Kelley
has been American television's best hope for pungent drama about a
spectrum of issues _ sex is only one _ that touch the human soul
and psyche.
</P>
<P>
   But now the most provocative thing on offer from TV's most
honored producer is the needlessly offensive broadcast of the ``s''
word?
</P>
<P>
   Something is badly askew, and the man who is supposed to be part
of the solution is instead making himself part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Kelley apparently needs some revitalizing rest and
about three fewer network shows. Then we'd see talent again,
instead of flashy but demeaning parlor tricks.

`BEST MAN' IS SON OF `BIG CHILL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like one of those novels on the order of ``Milk in My Coffee,''
``The Best Man'' is a romantic comedy about the confusion that sex
can bring into friendships. Taye Diggs is attending a wedding for
which his best friends from college are convening. He's the best
man who's determined to get groom Morris Chestnut ``over the broom
if it kills me.'' And it just might, as novelist Diggs has written
a book that could potentially wreak havoc at the scene of football
superstar Chestnut's wedding. (Ironically, it was Diggs who brought
the bride and groom together.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' is built around a piece of information that is
supposed to build suspense, but it's so obvious that it makes the
characters look silly for not having figured it out until the
weekend of the wedding. If you're willing to suspend disbelief for
the length of the picture, you'll have a good time. Writer-director
Malcolm Lee (cousin of Spike Lee, who is listed as a producer on
this film) isn't untalented; ``Best Man'' has a sweetness, and more
important, an earnestness that's powerfully touching with its
buppies-in-the-making. This movie is more subversive than
``American Beauty'' because this genre _ comedies about a thriving
black middle class _ is still so new to mainstream film. (And,
unfortunately, a comedy with a predominantly black cast is still
likely to scare off a mainstream _ white _ audience.)
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of his gleaming cool in ``Go'' _ where he was
so suave, it made no sense that he would hang out with the geeks he
was chasing girls with _ Diggs hasn't had much of a chance to
display the talent he showed onstage in ``Rent.'' (He does finally
get to dance a little bit here, though.) Because his role requires
him to look apprehensive all the time, Diggs looks stricken.
Mostly, he acts with his pecs, as does Morris Chestnut. (The rest
of Diggs' performance comes from the fact that, for one of the few
times in film history outside a Woody Allen movie, the glasses his
character wears are obviously necessary; you can see the
magnification in them.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Best Man'' is worth seeing for one of the best
performances of the year, that of Terrence Howard. Howard is the
mack-tastic member of the crew whose hooded cynicism is a thing of
beauty; it's his world, and all we do is live in it. Howard's
introduction, as he nonchalantly blazes through a flamenco guitar
solo while keeping an eye on the honeys, almost turns the picture
on its ear. Fortunately, all his scenes are just as good. He's the
truth teller who turns out to have a soul after all. (Lee doesn't
sentimentalize Howard, either; he's still self-centered and vain at
the end.) And Melissa De Sousa, who plays the spoiled-rotten
blossom of a girlfriend to Harold Perrineau, is deliciously
manipulative. Any director who can deliver comic characters this
well-rendered has something going for him. Now, if Howard and De
Sousa were the center of ``The Best Man,'' it'd live up to Lee's
promise. Still, in the end, it offers a promise. No small thing.

GOOD GOLLY, THIS `MOLLY' IS A LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a review I don't entirely agree with, Pauline Kael described
Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance in ``Rain Man'' as
playing ``one note on a piano for two hours and 11 minutes.''
Elisabeth Shue finds more than one note in ``Molly,'' but they all
sound like nails being raked across a chalkboard. Shue's title
character starts the movie as a barely functional autistic, and the
actress takes this as her cue to overdo it: She mocks, she screams,
she even barks. When one of those miracle movie operations makes
Molly more functional and she has to do nearly 30 years of maturing
in a matter of days, Shue confuses her character's growing
self-confidence with smugness. And if you've seen ``Awakenings,''
you know what happens next. Aaron Eckhart, sporting a surfer-blond
'do, plays the estranged brother who bonds with the new, improved
Molly. Although it has some things to say about caretakers' woes
and the autistic's world, ``Molly'' mostly just plays like a
glorified TV movie. In fact, with its brief length _ which it
achieves by jumping from point A to point B so fast it seems as if
entire hunks were lopped out _ it'll fit in perfectly on the
Lifetime channel. &QL;

`BODY SHOTS': VENUS AND MARS COLLIDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening scenes of ``Body Shots,'' a groggy young man
rises from his date's bed, urinates on her closed toilet and mops
up the mess with her bathroom rug. Moments later, a distraught
young woman at the wheel of a car speeding through the night in a
blinding downpour skids to a spinning stop, shoves open the door
and vomits onto the rain-swept road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body Shots'' is not the sort of movie to leave much to the
imagination, and when a passing remark about a class on oral sex is
buttressed by images of a group of women seated on a floor around a
table whose centerpiece is a model of a penis, the conclusion is
inescapable that the film's pretensions to significance are doomed
by its graphic style.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because in broad outline ``Body Shots'' seems eager to
grapple with questions like the difficulty of dating in the 1990s,
men versus women, sex, the definition of love and date rape.
</P>
<P>
   But the film, written by David McKenna and directed by Michael
Cristofer, who won the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for drama for his play
``The Shadow Box,'' is more focused on surface than true
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the eight principals _ four men and four women in
their 20s who sometimes address the camera _ speak frankly about
sex and their views of the opposite sex, but seeming more like
types than true individuals, they prove to be a lightweight lot.
</P>
<P>
   An allegation of date rape frames the story of ``Body Shots,''
and had the film focused steadfastly rather than briefly on its
impact on the eight principals and the workings of the law, the
exercise might have been more fruitful. But insistent on repeated
showings of the foreplay and coupling from the viewpoints of the
man and woman involved, ``Body Shots'' reveals itself to be neither
``Rashomon'' nor serious sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film takes place in the form of a flashback to the
night preceding the morning when the disheveled, bleeding Sara
(Tara Reid), an actress, turns up at the apartment of her friend
Jane (Amanda Peet) to tell her that she was raped by Mike (Jerry
O'Connell), a cave man in the guise of a hulking professional
football player.
</P>
<P>
   Jane, a clerk in the district attorney's office, sends away Rick
(Sean Patrick Flanery), the lawyer who woke up on her bed, and the
film proceeds to show its characters in the hours before the
disputed event.The four male friends, roommates and acquaintances,
include not only Rick and the belligerent Mike but also Shawn (Brad
Rowe), who is sweet on Sara; and Trent (Ron Livingston), who runs
pornography on his office computer and boasts that he works hard
and likes to play hard.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Jane and Sara, the women include the quiet Emma (Sybil
Temchen) and the cool, blond Whitney (Emily Procter), who works at
the frenetic dance club where, well fueled by alcohol, they have
all arranged to meet.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the film's emphasis on style, the cast is
attractive and talented, but some dramas call for more than meets
the eye.
</P>

`THREE TO TANGO': HE'S NOT GAY, BUT PRETENDS TO BE. CHAOS ENSUES. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Three to Tango,'' a leering screwball sex comedy set in
contemporary Chicago, is like an overly boisterous party guest who
is so nervous meeting strangers that he compulsively spews out
bawdy jokes in a loud, belligerent voice.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the movie has plenty of reason to be nervous.
For the tolerance toward homosexuality exhibited by the story of
Oscar Novak (Matthew Perry), an avidly heterosexual architect who,
for business reasons, is coerced into pretending he's gay, often
feels strained and shallow.
</P>
<P>
   This allegedly liberated comedy has some nasty undercurrents
that lend it a slightly sour taste. For the duration of his
charade, Oscar goes around in a state of barely controlled panic.
He finds it almost unendurable to be thought gay.
</P>
<P>
   After reading a newspaper article in which he comes out of the
closet, Oscar's parents go ballistic and his closest straight pals
shrink from him, even after he swears that he's really straight. In
the movie's portrayal of relations between gay men and straight
women, a group of women treat Oscar as a fellow ``girlfriend'' who
has had to put up with the same kinds of harassment and lame sexual
pitches they have.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is funny up to a point, in a crude barroomy sort of way.
And had someone other than Perry, a bluff, competent actor of
decidedly limited charm, played Oscar, the movie's tone might have
seemed a bit less overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar's troubles begin when he and his gay architectural
partner, Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), compete with another team
to design a $90 million cultural center. The billionaire
entrepreneur underwriting the project is a lean, gimlet-eyed
lothario, Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott), who is married but
having an affair with Amy Post (Neve Campbell), a glass sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   On being deliberately misinformed by the rival team that Oliver
is gay, Charles, deciding that Oliver would be ``safe'' companion
for his girlfriend, pressures him to spy on Amy at her gallery
opening to make sure she isn't flirting with her former boyfriend,
Kevin Cartwright (Cylk Cozart), a professional football player and
legendary stud.
</P>
<P>
   The evening evolves into a madcap adventure in which Oliver
saves one of Amy's glass works from destruction and the pair suffer
various mishaps including eating tainted tuna melts, which leaves
them vomiting side by side on the street. (What a way to bond!)
</P>
<P>
   Although Oliver is instantly smitten with Amy, whom Ms. Campbell
portrays with a breezy free-spirited bounce, he has to conceal his
true feelings. Eventually Oliver, having been chosen man of the
year by a gay professional organization, finds himself compelled to
give a televised acceptance speech and at long last rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Three to Tango,'' as in the amiably nonsensical ``Happy,
Texas,'' you can feel Hollywood suffering from the box office
jitters as it strains to be cool about a touchy subject. The movie
has a lot in common with the recent (and more likable) ``Happy,
Texas,'' which gave us two straight men feigning gayness and an
ostensibly straight town sheriff (sweetly played by William H.
Macy) who turns out to a doe-eyed gay man pining for one of the
impostors.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Three to Tango'' the equivalent of the sheriff is the
football player, who has only recently discovered he's gay and
comes on strong to Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Once it gets its ducks in a row, ``Three to Tango,'' directed by
Damon Santostefano, follows a totally predictable path. In trying
to be both bold and nonthreatening, the movie ends up seeming tame
and mildly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES

UBERPRODUCERS ARE MONOPOLIZING THE TUBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes either a lot of talent or a lot of nerve to make a TV
series that's essentially a sharply edited rerun of your first
series and expect people to actually sit still and tune in. David
E. Kelley, he with the golden touch, has done it and, surprise,
people aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Ally doesn't command ``Ally McBeal's'' audience loyalty, even
though 8 million people watched the half-hour series when it
debuted, and 6 million or so are apparently hanging around waiting
for it to get better.
</P>
<P>
   That's 4 million fewer than those tuning in to ``Snoops,''
Kelley's new series about wacky private eyes airing Sundays on ABC;
11 million fewer than those putting aside Sunday nights for
Kelley's prickly law drama ``The Practice''; and 5 million fewer
than those catching ``Chicago Hope,'' the medical drama Kelley
created in 1994, abandoned in 1996, and has returned to for a
last-ditch exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother counting. That's five shows on three networks, most
of them with Kelley as sole writer, head writer, rewrite guy or
script supervisor who, if the Kelley myth is to be believed, has
quite the heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the movie scripts. Two this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   All that and Emmys, too.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's become fashionable to take a shot at the guy, to
say he's spreading himself way too thin, or even charge him with
forgetting that quality more than quantity fueled his early,
blemish-free reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But try as you might to be fair, to let the bandwagon whiz on
by, it's obvious that although Monday's season premiere of ``Ally
McBeal'' looks awfully strong, ``Snoops'' and the new ``Chicago
Hope'' look equally lifeless. And ``The Practice'' so far this
season is Kelley-lite, which begs the question of whether he's
merely spinning his wheels.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing the topic of producers who have taken on more
than they can handle, retreading is the chief symptom. The well is
only so deep, they say, and it's just a matter of time before all
their work starts showing dangerous signs of sameness. See Steven
Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   But producers continue to spin off other shows anyway, partly
for the money, partly for the power, partly for the creative
release, partly because they can.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling and Norman Lear always had their hands in a
number of cookie jars during the '70s (Spelling still does), but
television these days is looking a lot like corporate America,
where everything is being concentrated in the hands of a very few.
</P>
<P>
   This season alone, ``ER'' creator John Wells has ``Third Watch''
and ``West Wing,'' Chris Thompson is producing ``Action'' and
``Ladies Man,'' and Joss Whedon created ``Angel'' to follow ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Amy Lippman and Chris Keyser will add ``Time of Your
Life'' to ``Party of Five,'' Joel Silver has both ``The Strip'' and
``Action,'' and Dick Wolf has cloned his ``Law &AMP; Order'' franchise.
Yvette Lee Bowser, executive producer for The WB's ``For Your
Love,'' is developing series for NBC and The WB.
</P>
<P>
   Only Aaron Sorkin, however, truly comes close to rivaling Kelley
as a madman/writer, handling duties on ``Sports Night'' and ``West
Wing'' single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Farquhar is one producer who doesn't get the
spread-your-talent theory. He left the coming-of-age comedy
``Moesha'' this season to co-create and produce the new UPN series
``The Parkers.'' ``I'm a writer, too,'' says Farquhar, who also
penned ``South Central.'' ``And I don't know how (Kelley) does it.
But then, I don't know if I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these uberproducers do it by hiring ``show runners,''
who look over the daily details while they shuttle from one show to
another. But do any of these shows have the full attention and full
expertise of their creator? And are audiences paying the price for
that?
</P>
<P>
   Kelley may be considered the point man for this trend, but I
blame the invasion of feature film writers who, after being bullied
on the film set, see TV as a wide-open playground.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Williamson wrote ``Scream'' before bringing ``Dawson's
Creek'' and ``Wasteland'' to TV. Sorkin penned ``The American
President,'' ``A Few Good Men'' and others, and Silver is the man
behind ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``Die Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Whedon, whose film writing credits include ``Speed,''
``Twister'' and ``Toy Story,'' for which he received an Oscar
nomination, talks often about the rush of seeing what he puts down
on paper come out of Sarah Michelle Gellar's mouth on ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   What a stark change, he notes, from the hierarchy in film, where
a director is in charge and the writer is a nonentity. (He also
wrote the 1992 ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' film, but says he hated
the results.)
</P>
<P>
   As for leaving ``Buffy'' with less than his best, Whedon says he
won't, describing the series as ``a drug'' he can't kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it an impossible workload?'' Whedon says of working on both
shows. ``Yes, it is. Will I have a nervous breakdown? Yes, I will.
But will `Buffy' fans get shortchanged? No, they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, busy writing the recent film ``Teaching Mrs.
Tingle'' and launching ``Wasteland,'' pulled out of ``Dawson's
Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You shortchange your audience because you don't have the time
to think about the characters. You're just hitting a deadline,''
Williamson says. ``I never want to be in that spot creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought about this whole issue while watching ``Snoops'' the
other night when Jane Krakowski was brought on as a guest, playing
her ``Ally McBeal'' character Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   I'll spare you the details and only say that it didn't work,
and, in fact, turned out to be choppy and forced.
</P>
<P>
   A Kelley show choppy and forced. Now that's one we haven't
heard.

`BATS': YOU'LL WISH THEY WERE JUST IN THE BELFRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In the beginning were the biblical plagues. In the fullness of
time, they begat cinema's plagues of ants, bees, spiders, birds and
various viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Bats.''
</P>
<P>
   A pox on it.
</P>
<P>
   Masquerading as a Halloween season horror film, this noisy
version of a washed-out formula is cause for fright in only one
respect: the possibility that it could spawn sequels.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly an excuse for igniting flames, cooking cars, shattering
windows and launching fireworks of sparks while littering the
rather pretty Western landscape with corpses, ``Bats'' manages to
overlook suspense and terror.
</P>
<P>
   Among its characters, only Lou Diamond Phillips as Emmett
Kimsey, a small-town Texas sheriff, manages to suggest a human
drawn from life rather than a rash of old movies. And Dina Meyer,
as the wildlife zoologist and bat specialist called in when the
local toll of mysterious deaths begins to mount, succeeds in
investing the role of Dr. Sheila Casper with energy and wit.
</P>
<P>
   But Leon as Jimmy Sands, her assistant, is the only mammal in
the movie capable of making the audience squirm. Under the
direction of Louis Morneau, working from a screenplay by John
Logan, the bat-fearing Jimmy is saddled with lame lines struggling
to rise to the status of jokes and kick-me-in-the-script moments,
including the one where he shouts that the plague of bats ``is not
funny.'' Here it sometimes is, which is not the film's intention.
</P>
<P>
   To Bob Gunton as Dr. Alexander McCabe falls the role of evil
scientist responsible for the deadly bat attacks in Gallup, Texas
(pop. 7,000), where F.W. Murnau's 1927 vampire movie,
``Nosferatu,'' just happens to be playing in the local theater. And
as ``Bats'' progresses, Dr. McCabe's sidelong glances and
remoteness give way to the familiar loony tics, sabotage and
megalomaniacal declarations that customarily end in what Winston
Churchill liked to call condign punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was batty Dr. McCabe, a slavish believer in science as
the path to betterment, who mutated a couple of bats that escaped
from his lab and are now busily turning their generally fruit- and
bug-eating gentle ilk into aggressive omnivores with enhanced
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   So after a teen-age couple meet a bloody death right at the
start of a make-out session on a lonely road one night, Dr. Casper
is summoned by the Centers for Disease Control to have a look at
the corpses, while Dr. McCabe stands by.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly realizes what the problem is, but the townspeople
fail to heed a warning to evacuate, and soon the plague (two real
bats and the others animatronic and computer-generated) is upon
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy, a computer wiz, shows one and all that it is only a
matter of time before North America is overrun by beastly bats but
that, of course, there is a chance to nip the onslaught in the
roost. That is, if the meddling government agent behind Dr.
McCabe's project and the military don't blow up the abandoned mine
where the bats are snoozing and scatter them to the winds.
</P>
<P>
   As the heroes plods through guano to a predictable finish, the
pulse remains steadfastly unaccelerated.
</P>
<P>

LYNCH'S LATEST PLAYS IT `STRAIGHT' AGAINST THE GRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Lynch is one of the few successful American filmmakers who
seems to have made little or no concession to commercial
considerations throughout his career. Consistently, he makes
whatever film interests him at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at this low point in his career _ after the flops
of ``Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me'' and ``Lost Highway'' _ the
wise thing for him to do would be to chase a hit, either with a
star vehicle or with a film full of Lynchian elements that have
worked for him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's given us ``The Straight Story,'' a low-key,
low-budget, G-rated inspirational film for the Disney company about
an old man on a journey. I loved it, but it's exactly the kind of
underwhelming movie that seems guaranteed to get lost in the
multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the based-on-a-true-story of a 73-year-old Iowa man named
Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) who decides to visit his
estranged brother (Harry Dean Stanton) in Wisconsin after learning
his brother has suffered a debilitating stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvin's own health is badly deteriorating, he's nearly
blind, and he has no driver's license. So the only way he can make
the trip is on his 1966-vintage John Deere lawn tractor _ puttering
along the highway at less than 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his six-week journey, he has a few mechanical
problems and a few harrowing adventures, and he meets some
interesting and mostly friendly people who seem eager to help him.
But he remains determined to ``finish the trip the way I started
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an enjoyably eccentric but thin story that might have been
easily handled in an afternoon TV special for kids. And Lynch's
approach is so understated _ avoiding the obvious emotional and
inspirational scenes _ that it often seems to vanish before our
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has its own lazy charm and some unforgettable moments,
as when Straight exchanges horrific war stories with another old
veteran. And it has some subtle bite: Its G-rating and upbeat
ending nothwithstanding, the movie is a somber meditation on the
helplessness of old age.
</P>
<P>
   The film also has an Oscar-worthy performance from 78-year-old
Farnsworth, the veteran Hollywood stunt man who turned into a
venerable character lead (``The Grey Fox,'' ``Comes a Horseman'')
well after age 60 but has recently been in semi-retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Without trying very hard, Farnsworth commands a unique and
immensely appealing screen presence that could be called ``a
compilation of all the great western heroes of the movie past.'' He
gives the character and his quest an honesty and dignity both
inspiring and heartbreaking.
</P>

   The Straight Story. Directed by David Lynch. Written by John
Roach and Mary Sweeny. Cast: Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,
Harry Dean Stanton. Walt Disney Pictures. 111 minutes. Rated G,
suitable for all audiences.

`MEN CRY BULLETS': HE PUTS ON HIS DRESS ONE LEG AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best part of ``Men Cry Bullets'' is not when Gloria's blond
debutante cousin chases Gloria's pet pig, Jack, with an ax. The
best part is when Gloria, having learned of the slaughter, leaps
onto the dining room table and embraces the pork roast, sobbing,
``I'm a terrible mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``Men Cry Bullets,'' a muddled film with John Waters
aspirations, is not about animals, motherhood or vegetarianism,
however. It is, says Tamara Hernandez, its writer, director and
co-producer, a message about domestic violence, told with the
gender roles reversed to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   Billy (Steven Nelson) is the ingenue and a virgin, and Gloria
(Honey Lauren) is the seducer who grabs Billy's crotch and murmurs,
``You know you want it; you wouldn't be here if you didn't want
it,'' as he tearfully succumbs. And although this is largely inept
filmmaking, that scene has a flicker of power.
</P>
<P>
   Both the main characters often dress in drag, although not
particularly attractive drag. Lydia, the cousin (``I'm a debutante.
I've got dozens of dresses like this''), is played by Jeri Ryan,
best known as the predominantly alien character named Seven of Nine
on ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' and she does have screen presence.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the film just wanders around confused, trying
to pass for post-modern, throwing in a menage a trois fueled by
possibly poisoned wine and proudly showing off the other acts at
the club where Billy works: a man who lifts weights with chains
attached to his nipples and a woman who eats a huge plateful of
live worms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men Cry Bullets'' opens Friday at the Angelika Film Center in
Manhattan. It includes profuse profanity, sexual situations, full
frontal male nudity, partial female nudity, animal murder, gunshots
and a strangling.

`TANGO' TWISTS TO AN ALL-TOO-PREDICTABLE PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where have we seen this movie before? From ``Some Like It Hot''
to ``Tootsie,'' from ``The Associate'' to ``Happy, Texas,'' film
characters have long pretended to be something they're not in order
to achieve a goal: love of a woman, a big job _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   The films' current trend, which features heterosexual characters
playing gay, is certainly no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three to Tango'' stars TV actors Matthew Perry (``Friends''),
Neve Campbell (``Party of Five'') and Dylan McDermott (``The
Practice'') also charading as big-screen movie-star material. Perry
(``Fools Rush In'') has had sketchy luck beyond the small screen;
Campbell and McDermott have had hit movies _ ``Scream'' and ``Steel
Magnolias,'' respectively _ but also have suffered box office
blues.
</P>
<P>
   Their current outing is a tepid if moderately likable romantic
comedy, but it's highly unlikely to be a conduit to movie-star
status. Still, it has some charm; Perry seems looser and more
relaxed than usual even though he's playing a role similar to that
of Chandler on ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Novak (Perry) is, along with his gay associate Peter
Steinberg (Oliver Platt), a talented architect. The pair are up for
bid on a $90million renovation job sanctioned by billionaire
Charles Newman (McDermott). But their opposition, Strauss (John C.
McGinley) and Decker (Bob Balaban), aren't going to play fair. When
a moment of support between Oscar and Peter is overheard by
Newman's assistant, Lenore (Deborah Rush), the duo are taken to be
romantic as well as business partners, a status Strauss
</P>
<P>
   and Decker heartily confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Newman pits the teams against each other and asks the
motor-mouthed Oscar for a favor as well. The jealous, suspicious
businessman keeps an independent, arty mistress, Amy Post
(Campbell), and wants Oscar, being gay and no threat, to keep an
eye on her moves at an art gallery opening. Of course, Oscar, who
is really quite a ladies man, falls head over heels.
</P>
<P>
   The vapid plotline follows the same narrative arc as ``Tootsie''
but hasn't the heart or purpose of that film, most because its
script tries to stay trendy by tossing in offbeat humor out of
``There's Something About Mary.'' It's ultimately just a mish-mash
of movie moments without any fresh invention.
</P>
<P>
   Three to Tango. Directed by Damon Santostefano. Written by
Rodney Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna. Cast: Matthew Perry, Neve
Campbell, Dylan McDermott. Warner Bros. 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
language, sexual themes.

THAT `NOISE' YOUR KIDS ARE LISTENING TO IS HEAVY METAL AND HIP-HOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents have always listened to their kids' rock 'n' roll and
wondered, ``What is that noise?''
</P>
<P>
   It's been true since the '50s, it was true in the '70s _ with
the advent of metal acts such as Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin _
and it's certainly been true in the '80s and '90s, as hip-hop and
grunge established themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For kids, that's at least half the fun _ giving Dad and Mom the
willies because what you're listening to doesn't sound like what
they used to listen to, be it Elvis or Ted Nugent or Public Enemy
or Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Well, parents, it's happening again: 1999 has seen
heavy-metal-hip-hop make a huge surge in popularity via acts such
as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock and the continuing arena-filling
popularity of Korn.
</P>
<P>
   All three acts have taken their stylistic cues from such
established groups as 311 and the politically charged Rage Against
the Machine and have sold millions of copies of their latest CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's ``Devil Without a Cause'' and the Bizkit's ``Significant
Other'' have sold more than 3 million copies each.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are listening. But to what?
</P>
<P>
   From a distance _ say, the other side of your son's bedroom door
_ the mingling of metal and hip-hop (dubbed ``rip-hop'' by some)
might just sound like loud, aggressive hard rock has always
sounded: loud and aggressive, with lots of guitars and some angry
young guy hollering.
</P>
<P>
   But the current crop of young rip-hop acts is funneling the
grinding/thrashing guitars (and us-against-them attitude) of
Metallica and mixing it up with beats and emphatic raps that recall
any number of hip-hop acts, such as Ice Cube, Run-D.M.C., Public
Enemy, Dr. Dre, Tupac and Snoop Doggy Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   Metal and hip-hop always belonged together: Both emphasize hard,
insistent beats, male braggadocio, hard living, bucking the system,
having plenty of female companionship and generally making one's
way on one's own terms. The two have been fused for more than a
decade, since the Beastie Boys debuted in 1986 with the ``Licensed
to Ill'' LP and its attendant hit single, ``(You Gotta) Fight for
Your Right (to Party).''
</P>
<P>
   But with other forms of hard rock (industrial, grunge) having
long ago peaked commercially, thousands of young music fans from
all demographics have latched onto rip-hop as a way to reject
mainstream society, act tough and assert their independence _ and
their allegiance to urban music and the high-living inner-city
gangstas they would so love to be.
</P>
<P>
   Confused yet? Don't be.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned? Maybe you should be.
</P>
<P>
   Below is a parent-friendly guide to rip-hop's major acts _
including which are nasty as they wanna be and which are
(relatively) nice.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit
</P>
<P>
   Home: Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Latest CD: ``Significant Other''
</P>
<P>
   Notable stuff: Currently the biggest rip-hop act in the country,
this is the band that encouraged Woodstock attendees to ``smash
stuff'' right before the fires began to burn. Perform with a giant
toilet onstage. Lead singer Fred Durst was recently made an
executive at the band's label, Interscope. Their big hit this
summer was ``Nookie,'' which is about exactly what you think it's
about.
</P>
<P>
   Sound: Led Zeppelin meets Ice Cube, as performed by a bunch of
white kids who like girls, making money, more girls, and destroying
stuff because they're having a bad day. Really. They wrote a song
about this.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty scale: 7 out of 10. They like the ladies (including adult
film actresses), but since their audience is 14-year-old guys who
have never seen a naked woman anywhere but on the Internet, they're
more funny than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock
</P>
<P>
   Home: The mean suburbs of Detroit _ did anyone say ``Vanilla
Ice''?
</P>
<P>
   Latest CD: ``Devil Without a Cause''
</P>
<P>
   Notable stuff: This is the shirtless guy with lank blond hair
you saw kickin' it with Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith on the latest MTV
awards show. He brags of once having been a small-time crack dealer
and of his years in the hip-hop wilderness. He's the
self-proclaimed spokesdude for all the rap-loving white boys out
there. ``You're straight outta Compton? I'm straight outta the
trailer!'' he raps on ``Cowboy,'' one of several hits on ``Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound: Some big, greasy guitars, plenty of hip-hop beats,
country touches and that good ol' Detroit attitude. He's making
money left and right and meeting lots of young ladies, and he'll be
more than happy to tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty scale: 8 out of 10. The Kid's all about the women.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   311
</P>
<P>
   Home: Nebraska. No snickering in the back, you.
</P>
<P>
   Latest CD: ``Sound System,'' which came out last week
</P>
<P>
   Notable stuff: Nice guys, apparently, who were merging rock and
rap before anyone had ever heard of Fred and the Kid. Tour like
mad. Had two big hits, ``Down'' and ``All Mixed Up,'' in 1996.
Photogenic, hard-working, sincere _ and their new CD comes along at
the perfect time for them to capitalize on the craze.
</P>
<P>
   Sound: Musically, these guys may well be the most astute band of
the whole bunch. Rap merges with enormo guitar, but there are also
smartly placed nods to reggae, R&AMP;B and funk.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty scale: Basically zero. 311 songs are about spiritual
topics, the joy of music, dealing with the modern world and so on.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Korn
</P>
<P>
   Home: Bakersfield, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Latest CD: ``Follow the Leader''
</P>
<P>
   Notable stuff: Massively popular depressed-rock for the masses _
it's almost a requirement that every suburban high-school kid wear
a Korn T-shirt these days. Lead singer Jonathan Davis gave up a
career as a mortician to concentrate on music _ and sounds like it.
</P>
<P>
   Sound: Cathartic world-of-gloom despair with grinding, fuzzy
guitars _ and, ye sons of Scotland, Davis occasionally bleating
away on the bagpipes! Korn songs deal with homophobia, abuse,
incest and other unpleasantness, with Davis screaming out his
unhappiness to a sea of fist-punching fans.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty scale: One out of 10, maybe. These guys deal with adult
topics, but bragging about all the babes they've bagged isn't one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Rage Against the Machine
</P>
<P>
   Home: Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Latest CD: The band will release its third CD, ``The Battle of
Los Angeles,'' on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Notable stuff: The most politically charged and potent rip-hop
band out there _ by a wide margin. Lead singer Zack de la Rocha is
a disciple of Che Guevera and Allen Ginsberg (he used to recite the
latter's poetry on stage).
</P>
<P>
   Sound: Incendiary and thunderous _ musically and lyrically. For
example, the band has done songs about the evils of cultural
imperialism and racism and in support of the rights of Native
Americans. Guitarist Tom Morello is very inventive, and de la Rocha
(a small guy who always looks as though he's about to explode with
fury) is one of the most compelling vocalists currently performing.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty scale: Almost minus.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Pimpadelic
</P>
<P>
   From: Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Latest CD: The new ``Southern Devils''
</P>
<P>
   Notable stuff: Pimpadelic has become one of the Metroplex's most
popular live acts in the past year or so; their shows are notable
for the number of young women who get onstage and take off their
shirts. ``Southern Devils'' was recently picked up for distribution
by major hip-hop label Tommy Boy _ these guys are going to be very,
very popular indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Sound: Raging guitars, raging hormones _ and old-school
turntable scratches, overlaying songs about hard, hard partying.
Lead singer Dirty K brags, at various points, of being ``white
trash,'' selling records, having mucho sex, doing a lot of drugs,
and living a life of almost total hedonism. And somehow, I believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty scale: Full-on 10. They want your daughter and they want
her right now _ and not for dinner and a movie, either.

THEORY OF THINKING: AUTHOR REVISES, UPDATES POPULAR SIX HATS
METHOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Greeks were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, Aristotle, Socrates and Plato decided that arguing was
the best method of thinking, and that the more critical you could
be, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners adopted their ideas as if they were written in stone
and have been arguing in conference rooms, offices and factory
floors ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Many reasoning methods have been conceived, but few have such a
documented track record as the one developed by conceptual thinker
Edward De Bono: the Six Thinking Hats.
</P>
<P>
   Before you dismiss this as some sequel by Dr. Suess, consider
what companies around the globe have accomplished since the Six
Thinking Hats method was first described in De Bono's book 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   IBM says the method has reduced its meeting times by 75 percent.
Siemens, which with nearly 400,000 employees is the largest
corporation in Europe, has 37 internal trainers using the method
and every department has an innovation unit using the six hats.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, DuPont, Shell, British Petroleum and Federal Express are
just some of the many companies that have incorporated this simple
thinking change designed by De Bono, a Rhodes scholar who has
degrees in medicine and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Now out is a revised and updated version of his internationally
best-selling book ``Six Thinking Hats'' (Little, Brown and Co., 173
pages, $14.95). It joins a cadre of other bestsellers, including
``Lateral Thinking'' and ``Teach Your Child How to Think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Thinking Hats'' is remarkably simple to read, given that
it deals with changing the way humans think. Although De Bono has
included recent evidence of how the concept is working in various
companies, he does not bog the book down with too many examples.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he offers a fresh look at a fascinating theory that he
says is being used on everyone from preschoolers to executive
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there is a huge amount of experience using the Six Hats
method,'' De Bono writes. ``It is no longer a matter of trying out
something new and exotic. It is now a matter of catching up with a
powerful thinking method that has been in use for fourteen years
across all ages, cultures and abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   With meetings taking up 40 percent of U.S. manager's time on
average, this nonconfrontational, most systematic method of
thinking can decrease that time by up to 75 percent, De Bono has
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Six Hats method is used, the advantages soon become
clear,'' he writes. ``Instead of rambling, ego-driven meetings,
meetings are more constructive, productive and much faster. ...
Thinking becomes a game with defined rules, rather than a matter of
exhortation and condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Six Hats'' clarifies thinking by compartmentalizing it.
Each hat is a different color that represents a different way of
thinking. A white hat is concerned with objective facts and
figures, a red hat gives the emotional view, a black hat points out
weaknesses in an idea, a yellow hat covers positive thinking, green
represents creativity and new ideas and blue organizes the thinking
process and use of the other hats.
</P>
<P>
   People in the meeting are asked to think of wearing each hat at
a specific time, preferably for just a minute, to bring out all the
different aspects of a problem or idea. The result is a myriad of
information, data, feelings and moods, all brought out in a
controlled setting in a ``neutral and objective exploration,'' De
Bono writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confusion is the biggest enemy of good thinking,'' he writes.
``We try to do too many things at the same time. We look for
information. We are affected by feelings. We seek new ideas and
options. We have to be cautious. We want to find benefits. ...
Juggling with six balls at the same time is rather difficult.
Tossing up one ball at a time is much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bono writes individual chapters defining each hat, as well as
the method of using the hats effectively in meetings. His writing
is so clear, you can easily finish the book and feel well-versed in
the theory in not much over an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Implementing the concept is also easy, although it may take a
bit for the different types of personalities to try it out, De Bono
writes.
</P>
<P>
   But merging those types of personalities into a thinking machine
is ultimately what the book is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``By going straight to behavior, the Six Hats method is much
more acceptable and effective and quick than methods that set out
to change personalities,'' he writes.

   ``What's Your Exit Strategy? 7 Ways to Maximize the Value of the
Business You've Built''
</P>
<P>
   By Peter H. Engel
</P>
<P>
   Prima Publishing, $25
</P>
<P>
   Every business will someday be closed or sold, and every
business decision should be based on the way the owner plans to
leave the business, according to entrepreneur Peter Engel. In other
words, ``just because you build a successful business doesn't mean
that you can become rich from it,'' he writes. The book covers
selling a business to a strategic buyer, selling to a financial
buyer, going public, selling to heirs or employees, liquidating,
enforced liquidation and managing for life, as well as other
related topics.

   ``Million Dollar Selling Techniques''
</P>
<P>
   By The Million Dollar Round Table Center for Productivity
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   Before you wonder further about this strange author, let me
explain that the Million Dollar Round Table is an international
association made up of the top 6 percent of life insurance
producers in the world. This group of 19,000 from 400 companies
obviously knows how to sell. Cold callings, listening, selling to
different types _ all of the basics of selling are covered clearly
in this well-crafted book.

   ``Shakespeare on Management''
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Corrigan
</P>
<P>
   Kogan Page, $22.95
</P>
<P>
   With management books pulling quotes from Moses to Attila the
Hun, it seems only natural that Shakespeare would eventually
appear. Of course, his writings are filled with household business
phrases _ ``Neither a borrower nor a lender be'' _ and so on, but
this book goes quite a bit further in taking major Shakespearean
characters and what they say and pointing to the business world. A
good gift for those in love with Shakespeare. Otherwise, this
academic study will be completely lost on the average
businessperson.

HARD-LUCK JETS HOPE FOR BREAK FROM RAIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHELLE SMITH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The only good break the New York Jets have
gotten this season is that the Yankees' and Mets' postseason runs
turned attention away from what has befallen a team that fell one
game short of the Super Bowl last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with the start of the World Series, the Jets are just days
away from becoming headline fodder once again in New York. At 1-5
as they go into Sunday's game against the Raiders in Oakland, the
headlines are destined to be really big and bold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought things would go this way,'' Jets star wide
receiver Keyshawn Johnson said. ``You look at everything on paper
and you think your team is going to be good and all of a sudden,
things turn for the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were slapped with the Super Bowl contender label in the
preseason after having reached the AFC title game last January and
losing to Denver, 23-10. But expectations came crashing down in the
team's opening game when starting quarterback Vinny Testaverde
collapsed untouched on the turf with a ruptured Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   It has turned out to be only one of many injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas, the Jets' third starting quarterback of the season
after the injury to Testaverde and the ineptitude of Rick Mirer,
suffered a severe ankle sprain in last week's game against
Indianapolis and will be out 3 to 4 weeks. That leaves Mirer the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Starting safety Steve Atwater is questionable this week with a
pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Otis Smith is out with a broken collarbone, running
back Leon Johnson is in street clothes with a knee injury, and wide
receiver Wayne Chrebet returned last Sunday after missing the first
five games with a broken foot and caught five passes against the
Colts for 51 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most seriously, there is safety Kevin Williams, who
was hospitalized for a throat infection that spread to his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Bill Parcells has remade franchises. But he cannot
work miracles, although perhaps it's enough of a miracle that his
team _ riding the strength of its defense _ has stayed in nearly
every game. The Jets' largest margin of defeat is 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Even the status of Parcells, who led the Jets out of the dregs
after a 1-15 record in 1996, has been the subject of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells not only has health considerations _ he's had heart
surgery _ but the Jets' ownership situation for next season is also
unsettled and the team is $10 million over the 2000 salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought beyond this year, to tell you the truth,''
Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injuries, Parcells has felt dissatisfaction from
every direction. The first utterances of Rich Kotite's name _ the
man who posted a 4-28 record as the Jets head coach in 1995-96 _
have been heard around town. And the now-defunct possibility of a
Subway Series in baseball couldn't even protect Parcells from the
proper New York media roasting he got after Sunday's loss to
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells started the day by announcing that Lucas would be the
starter just 2 1/2 hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, with the Jets tied with the Colts 13-13,
Parcells called for a pass on first-and-goal at the Colts' 3-yard
line. Lucas' pass was intercepted, setting up Indianapolis'
game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens,'' Parcells said of the criticism. ``You
can't ever judge the wisdom of the calls by the results. Now
retrospectively, would I do it again? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went into that is we've been stopped on third-and-1 and
fourth-and-1. We had not been successful on goal-line offense
recently, we've been having some problems. But you can't explain
that to everybody. But who cares?''

   MINSK, Belarus _ When I went down to breakfast in my hotel one
day last week, the maitre d' greeted me in good English and asked,
``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' I said, though I had slept with my clothes on because
my room was so cold, and the heat had not yet been turned on. ``How
are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not good,'' he whispered, looking around to make sure that no
was listening. ``Things are very bad in this country,'' he said.
``Very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he might have added, they are getting worse by the day in
this former Soviet republic, which is ruled by President Alexander
Lukashenko, a Stalinist thug who is recreating a totalitarian
police state in the geographical center of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 30 years in journalism, I have been around the
world, and I have visited many countries, in Africa and elsewhere,
with unspeakably poor living conditions, repressive governments and
little hope.
</P>
<P>
   But I have never been so moved as by the situation in Belarus,
whose 10 million people had thought in 1991 that they were finally
free after 70 years of domination from Moscow, punctuated by the
brutal and murderous rule of the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Minsk, some people wore buttons promoting an
anti-Lukashenko ``Freedom March'' on Sunday, and they furtively
passed around a small handbill with a caricature blending
Lukashenko and Hitler and the urgent plea, ``Stop Luka.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the 15 new countries formed by the collapse of the Soviet
Union eight years ago Belarus is in the direst political and
economic straits. Violations of human rights are becoming more
serious and more alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Lukashenko's toughest opponents have disappeared off the
street in the last few months, and three weeks ago, the government
closed nine outspoken independent newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists that freedom of the press exists, but
there is continuing harassment of newspapers not controlled by the
state and of companies that advertise in them.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many private companies to begin with, as
Lukashenko has imposed a top-down, Soviet-style economy. Protesters
have been beaten up, and so have the journalists who were covering
their demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lukashenko wants to destroy all of the institutions of civil
society,'' a newspaper editor told me.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Belarus is like going through a time warp to the old
Soviet Union. The state is omnipresent and controlling. In the best
hotels, where foreigners stay, policemen stand by the elevators in
the lobby, watching who gets on and off.
</P>
<P>
   The Belarus ruble is suffering hyperinflation that is making it
virtually worthless. The average income in Belarus has fallen to
$30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Food shortages are widespread and common, but Lukashenko tells
the people that the shortages are the result of their eating too
much.
</P>
<P>
   The official exchange rate, which was 50,000 rubles to the
dollar less than a year ago, was 330,000 to the dollar last week.
But the unofficial, black market rate was 540,000 to the dollar
Oct. 11 and had fallen to 600,000 to the dollar by Saturday. My
hotel bill for a week was 204 million rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the people of Belarus look with envy and dismay at
their neighbors who have embraced liberal democracy and a
free-market economy and are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) away, is a thriving, vibrant city in stark contrast to the
gray and tired Minsk, which was almost completely destroyed during
World War II and was then rebuilt in grand Soviet style, with wide
boulevards and massive, hulking, nondescript buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are our people living as they are when their neighbors are
doing so much better?'' asked a prominent journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko, 45, who had been a Communist functionary during what
is called ``the Soviet time,'' became Belarus's first elected
president in 1994. His five-year term would have ended last July.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, after a rigged referendum, he disbanded the elected
Parliament and declared that his term of office would start on that
date, thereby giving himself an extra two years by fiat. Now he
seeks to reunite with Russia, and he dreams of becoming head of the
combined union.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, the militia were out in force throughout the
city. When thousands of people began their march, the militia
clashed with them, and dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting worse,'' the journalist said. ``People are
beginning to disappear. Newspapers are being shut down. The economy
is in shambles. The president is illegitimate.'' &QL;

 By MARSHALL I. GOLDMAN  
 c.1999 International Herald Tribune  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Every day there are new revelations and now
even indictments stemming from the avalanche of hot Russian money
passing through the Bank of New York on its way to a myriad of
other U.S., European and offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost no responsible officials in the U.S. and Russian
governments, nor those in international lending organizations, will
admit publicly that their funds or foreign aid have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there may have been a failure to report the sudden
influx of a few billion dollars now and then, but otherwise, as
Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, put it in a slightly
different context, ``Calm down world.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt a substantial portion of the $7.5 billion that was
filtered through Benex, a Potemkin-like office set up in 1996 by a
Russian emigre in Queens, N.Y., was not criminally derived money.
Much of it was from Russian and foreign businessmen seeking to
evade Russian taxes. That is unethical but not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But some of this money did come from corporate theft, organized
crime and government kickbacks as well as from misuse of U.S.
foreign aid, World Bank support and IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a sophisticated Western investor like BP Amoco, which may
never again see the $571 million it invested in Sidanco, a once
well regarded Russian oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask the Dart Group, which is struggling to retain its
investment in Yukos, another oil company. Or Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Company and the United States-Russia Investment Fund,
which has just discovered that their investment in the Lomonosov
porcelain factory has been nationalized to keep them from taking
control.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, ask Boris Yeltsin's son-in-law how he happened to
end up with $2.7 million in that same Bank of New York, not to
mention the other son-in-law's accounts in various Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   To be even more specific, Russian economists have complained
that in 1993, U.S. food aid was diverted and then re-exported,
which was contrary to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Roskhleboproduct, the Russian agency chosen to distribute the
grain in Russia, profited at the expense of the intended
recipients. Yet the same firm was selected to process the U.S. food
aid provided last year.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one example of misappropriated foreign aid. Even
former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin has complained that ``30
percent of &QL; 
our humanitarian aid is invariably stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   What about loans from the World Bank? A few weeks ago the
president of the World Bank asserted that there was no evidence
that its loans to Russia had been misused.
</P>
<P>
   This came as a surprise to several economists in and outside the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed specifically to money lent by the World Bank to
restructure and close many of Russia's obsolete coal mines.
According to the audit committee of the Russian Duma, the $600
million loan provided in 1996 for the coal mines seems to have
disappeared with little evident restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the loans from the International Monetary Fund.
It has acknowledged that there have been some problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has complained that the Russian central bank
diverted some of the country's reserves to an offshore account that
the bank had set up to avoid scrutiny and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IMF has charged that the Russian central bank
deliberately lied to the IMF by reporting that those funds were
still in Moscow, whereas they were actually in a controlled account
in the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But what IMF officials have not addressed is the claim that
senior central bank personnel took those funds and invested them in
high-yielding government securities back in Russia and kept the
proceeds for their personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also has a long history of taking dollars
borrowed from the IMF. Instead of selling them all at auction to
prop up the ruble, as it is supposed to do, it sets aside a
substantial portion at a lower rate for a few selected banks owned
by a few favored oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these transfers have a habit of taking place
immediately before a sharp devaluation of the ruble. Many of those
dollars then quickly find their way back to the West, if not
through the Bank of New York then through other Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way money flows and deals are made and unmade, it
is difficult to document most forms of corporate and government
theft in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   True, government officials in Russia are not the only ones in
the world who enter government service poor and exit as
multimillionaires or CEOs of their country's wealthiest utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet failure to penalize those Russian officials, institutions
and businessmen who have taken advantage of loose procedures,
including those who have stolen from the West, only perpetuates
such practices.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder so many Russians laugh at the naivete or seeming
obtuseness of Western officials, both private and governmental, who
seem to blind themselves to obvious examples of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   To say ``no'' to Russia now and then does not mean that we want
to cut Russia off from the world and force it to resume a hostile
arms buildup. After all, there are responsible voices in Russia,
including the former minister of finance, Boris Fyodorov, who have
urged the IMF to stop lending money to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Russia unable to repay such loans, Fyodorov warns,
but continued borrowing only nourishes destructive habits.
</P>
<P>
   Call it tough love. The time has come for policymakers to ask
themselves whether saying ``no'' occasionally might not facilitate
the reforms they seek more effectively than always saying ``yes.'' &QL;

 c.1999 International Herald Tribune

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Every day there are new revelations and now
even indictments stemming from the avalanche of hot Russian money
passing through the Bank of New York on its way to a myriad of
other U.S., European and offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost no responsible officials in the U.S. and Russian
governments, nor those in international lending organizations, will
admit publicly that their funds or foreign aid have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there may have been a failure to report the sudden
influx of a few billion dollars now and then, but otherwise, as
Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, put it in a slightly
different context, ``Calm down world.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt a substantial portion of the $7.5 billion that was
filtered through Benex, a Potemkin-like office set up in 1996 by a
Russian emigre in Queens, N.Y., was not criminally derived money.
Much of it was from Russian and foreign businessmen seeking to
evade Russian taxes. That is unethical but not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But some of this money did come from corporate theft, organized
crime and government kickbacks as well as from misuse of U.S.
foreign aid, World Bank support and IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a sophisticated Western investor like BP Amoco, which may
never again see the $571 million it invested in Sidanco, a once
well regarded Russian oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask the Dart Group, which is struggling to retain its
investment in Yukos, another oil company. Or Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Company and the United States-Russia Investment Fund,
which has just discovered that their investment in the Lomonosov
porcelain factory has been nationalized to keep them from taking
control.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, ask Boris Yeltsin's son-in-law how he happened to
end up with $2.7 million in that same Bank of New York, not to
mention the other son-in-law's accounts in various Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   To be even more specific, Russian economists have complained
that in 1993, U.S. food aid was diverted and then re-exported,
which was contrary to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Roskhleboproduct, the Russian agency chosen to distribute the
grain in Russia, profited at the expense of the intended
recipients. Yet the same firm was selected to process the U.S. food
aid provided last year.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one example of misappropriated foreign aid. Even
former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin has complained that ``30
percent of &QL; 
our humanitarian aid is invariably stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   What about loans from the World Bank? A few weeks ago the
president of the World Bank asserted that there was no evidence
that its loans to Russia had been misused.
</P>
<P>
   This came as a surprise to several economists in and outside the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed specifically to money lent by the World Bank to
restructure and close many of Russia's obsolete coal mines.
According to the audit committee of the Russian Duma, the $600
million loan provided in 1996 for the coal mines seems to have
disappeared with little evident restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the loans from the International Monetary Fund.
It has acknowledged that there have been some problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has complained that the Russian central bank
diverted some of the country's reserves to an offshore account that
the bank had set up to avoid scrutiny and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the IMF has charged that the Russian central bank
deliberately lied to the IMF by reporting that those funds were
still in Moscow, whereas they were actually in a controlled account
in the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But what IMF officials have not addressed is the claim that
senior central bank personnel took those funds and invested them in
high-yielding government securities back in Russia and kept the
proceeds for their personal use.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also has a long history of taking dollars
borrowed from the IMF. Instead of selling them all at auction to
prop up the ruble, as it is supposed to do, it sets aside a
substantial portion at a lower rate for a few selected banks owned

<P>
   Moreover, these transfers have a habit of taking place

through the Bank of New York then through other Western banks.

</P>

`SIXTH HAPPINESS': GROING UP WITH A DEFECT, AND CHARM AND
MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

<P>
   In ``Sixth Happiness,'' a boy who cannot grow grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of ``My Left Foot,'' this offbeat, beguiling English
production set in Bombay in the 1960s and '70s tells the story of
Brit, named by his sister for the brittle bones that characterize
the ailment he was born with: osteogenesis imperfecta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth Happiness,'' based on an autobiographical fiction by
Firdaus Kanga, who portrays Brit Kotwal, is the story not only of
how the boy comes to terms with himself but also of his impact on
his family. In addition the film, directed from Kanga's screenplay
by Waris Hussein (``Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx,''
et al.), looks with affection and amusement at life among India's
Parsees, who are descended from the Persians of a millennium ago,
maintain their customs and enjoyed a special status under the
British.
</P>
<P>
   Brit's story, told with humor as well as pain, is one of
progress from the broken legs of his childhood through his
education to his sexual awakening and self-acceptance through
relationships with a lodger, Cyrus (Ahsen Bhatti), and Cyrus'
girlfriend, Amy (Indira Varma).
</P>
<P>
   Brit's journey to a literary career is also the story of his
relationship with his parents _ Sera (Souad Faress), his Anglophile
mother, who loves him without reservation from the moment of his
birth, and Sam (Khodus Wadia), his handsome father, a bank manager
who can never really come to terms with his deformed son.
</P>
<P>
   The film is full of vivid secondary characters, including Brit's
bright, funny sister, Dolly Kotwal (Nina Wadia), who amuses him
with photos of nudes and adores him. And the music, beginning with
an enigmatic tango and including songs like ``Always,'' is used
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Presented without sentiment, Brit is no angel. He can be
manipulative and selfish as well as perceptive and funny. And as
Kanga and Hussein know, these qualities make him human and very
much worth knowing. &QL;

   SHENZHEN, China _ Although billed as a showcase for cutting-edge
technology, some of the most intriguing business plans being thrust
toward visitors at the Shenzhen High Tech Fair earlier this month
were adaptations of existing technology to unique niches in China's
vast consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Internet music may not yet be mainstream _ in China
or anywhere else _ but Shen Kum-tu is convinced his handheld MP3
player could quickly attract the millions of English-learners in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most MP3 devices, which can only play music downloaded
from the Internet, the machine Shen is developing will also allow
simultaneous recording from a built-in microphone. His device will
also be designed to jump easily between tracks.
</P>
<P>
   These features aim the product at the already thriving market
for recorded language lessons in China.
</P>
<P>
   With his hand-held MP3 device, priced at 800 yuan ($97), English
students across China will be able to download CD-quality English
lessons featuring the latest in slang expressions and listen to
themselves in their own speaking accent.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Shen and his company, Shenzhen Xinronghao
Industrial Co., are looking for a 20 million yuan investment to get
the device off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, one software developer said she believed she
had finally cracked the code on devising keystrokes for the
thousands of Chinese characters that have long restricted the
vocabulary available for Chinese-language documents written on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a half-century of research by her father, an eminent
lexicographer, Zheng Long's company has created a computer input
system capable of writing 100,000 characters, more than triple the
standard computer vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the characters are esoteric terms rarely needed
for everyday use, they are essential for traditional Chinese
medicine and to accurately write Chinese names. Long said these two
uses alone could open lucrative markets for her father's lifelong
academic pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Long also plans to tap the market for traditional Chinese
medicine by setting up the only Internet site on which discussions
using completely accurate characters for traditional herbal
remedies can take place.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Join Hands Century Technology Corp., is trying
to combat rampant product piracy in China with an anti-fraud
network.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared scanners linked nationwide by Internet will alert
manufacturers, suppliers, retailers and law-enforcement officials
when any member of the network inspects a product bearing a
fraudulent Join Hands label.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-strapped Chinese pager companies looking for gimmicks to
keep customers from migrating to mobile phones may find hope in a
new voice pager system now offered by Zhengzhou Aomei Electronic
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which says it recently completed an operational
trial with 20,000 subscribers in Henan Province, claims several
advantages over competing Japanese products.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Aomei's domestic manufacturing keep the price down
to 680 yuan a unit, but pager companies can upgrade their systems
without replacing the entire network.
</P>
<P>
   ``By only requiring an upgrade, we hope to attract companies in
China that cannot afford to fully change their network,'' said Zhu
Su-sheng, inventor of the system. &QL;

   DHEISHEH, West Bank _ Tapping into the Internet's ability to
abolish distances and knock down frontiers, Palestinian refugees
have begun a virtual gathering of exiles.
</P>
<P>
   A project called Across Borders is trying to bring together the
3.6 million-strong Palestinian diaspora, scattered across the
Middle East for the past 50 years, through a network of computer
centers and World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dheisheh became the first online refugee camp a couple of months
ago, and camps in Gaza, Lebanon and Jordan are expected to hook up
to the Net in the future. Birzeit University is the coordinator for
the project, which is funded by contributions from aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the project _ two West Bank Palestinians who
have spent part of their time in exile in the United States and
Australia, Muna Muhaisen and Adam Hanieh _ say they hope refugees
will use the immediacy of the Internet to let their political
demands be heard loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   But by bringing computer technology to low-tech, run-down camps,
the project may ultimately prove more successful at introducing
Palestinian children to the wonders of the modern world than at
bolstering the Palestinian refugee cause.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Israel, a technologically advanced society with a
per-capita gross domestic product 10 times that of the
Palestinians, the West Bank and Gaza look like technological
wastelands.
</P>
<P>
   There are Internet cafes in most large towns of the West Bank
and Gaza, but only 20 percent of households had telephone lines in
1997, and a mere 4 percent had computers, according to the
Palestinian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dheisheh computer center was inaugurated in July,
only a handful of the camp's 10,000 residents had access to
computers. Now, for 6 shekels ($1.40) an hour, anyone with a bit of
training can surf the Web on one of the center's 14 computers
donated by the Canada Fund and other aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Across Borders encourages people to post news items and essays
and bits of oral history on the camp's Web site. But most of the
activity at the computer center _ where screen savers say
``Palestine'' _ has nothing to do with identity or politics.
</P>
<P>
   Children flock to the computer monitors to play games in which
they destroy imaginary enemies, not to mull over real-life
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of being introduced to the concept of a computer
mouse, boys were visiting the Web site of their favorite soccer
player, Ronaldo, and downloading pictures of National Basketball
Association (NBA) celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Free computer classes for children and adults are intended to
ensure that as many people as possible will use the camp's computer
resources.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a student has done research on cloning, a hairdresser
has surfed the Web for new hairdos, and a carpenter has downloaded
designs, but by and large, ``not many people are aware of all that
there is on the Internet,'' said Jamal Abdulkareem, Dheisheh's
33-year-old Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors and peer pressure in the computer room are supposed
to keep sites that mention sex, drugs and other topics offensive to
the community off limits.
</P>
<P>
   But at the center one recent day, a teenager quietly read an
innocent-looking, all-text Web page devoted to the merits of Viagra
_ seeming to suggest that walls will fall faster than the project's
founders imagine.
</P>
<P>
   To refugees, virtual travel is one of the Internet's most
tangible benefits. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot visit
compatriots in the Gaza Strip 110 kilometers (70 miles) away on the
Mediterranean coast unless they obtain hard-to-get permits from
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're unable to go to picnics, unable to go to the sea,
unable to go to movies in Jerusalem, it's like being in a prison
cell,'' said Mrs. Muhaisen, a 39-year-old Palestinian-American
journalist who is one of the project's main architects. ``Your
world becomes very limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Muhaisen was born in Jerusalem but lost her residency
rights during her parents' time in exile. The Internet provides her
with a ``way out'' of the 1-square-kilometer camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's Web site is geared toward young Palestinians who have
spent all their lives in camps. A section called ``Villages of
1948'' ensures that children know where their family homes were _
even though those villages have mostly been torn down or
incorporated into Israeli cities by now.
</P>
<P>

   DHEISHEH, West Bank _ Tapping into the Internet's ability to
abolish distances and knock down frontiers, Palestinian refugees
have begun a virtual gathering of exiles.
</P>
<P>
   A project called Across Borders is trying to bring together the
3.6 million-strong Palestinian diaspora, scattered across the
Middle East for the past 50 years, through a network of computer
centers and World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dheisheh became the first online refugee camp a couple of months
ago, and camps in Gaza, Lebanon and Jordan are expected to hook up
to the Net in the future. Birzeit University is the coordinator for
the project, which is funded by contributions from aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the project _ two West Bank Palestinians who
have spent part of their time in exile in the United States and
Australia, Muna Muhaisen and Adam Hanieh _ say they hope refugees
will use the immediacy of the Internet to let their political
demands be heard loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   But by bringing computer technology to low-tech, run-down camps,
the project may ultimately prove more successful at introducing
Palestinian children to the wonders of the modern world than at
bolstering the Palestinian refugee cause.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Israel, a technologically advanced society with a
per-capita gross domestic product 10 times that of the
Palestinians, the West Bank and Gaza look like technological
wastelands.
</P>
<P>
   There are Internet cafes in most large towns of the West Bank
and Gaza, but only 20 percent of households had telephone lines in
1997, and a mere 4 percent had computers, according to the
Palestinian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dheisheh computer center was inaugurated in July,
only a handful of the camp's 10,000 residents had access to
computers. Now, for 6 shekels ($1.40) an hour, anyone with a bit of
training can surf the Web on one of the center's 14 computers
donated by the Canada Fund and other aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Across Borders encourages people to post news items and essays
and bits of oral history on the camp's Web site. But most of the
activity at the computer center _ where screen savers say
``Palestine'' _ has nothing to do with identity or politics.
</P>
<P>
   Children flock to the computer monitors to play games in which
they destroy imaginary enemies, not to mull over real-life
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of being introduced to the concept of a computer
mouse, boys were visiting the Web site of their favorite soccer
player, Ronaldo, and downloading pictures of National Basketball
Association (NBA) celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Free computer classes for children and adults are intended to
ensure that as many people as possible will use the camp's computer
resources.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a student has done research on cloning, a hairdresser
has surfed the Web for new hairdos, and a carpenter has downloaded
designs, but by and large, ``not many people are aware of all that
there is on the Internet,'' said Jamal Abdulkareem, Dheisheh's
33-year-old Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors and peer pressure in the computer room are supposed
to keep sites that mention sex, drugs and other topics offensive to
the community off limits.
</P>
<P>
   But at the center one recent day, a teenager quietly read an
innocent-looking, all-text Web page devoted to the merits of Viagra
_ seeming to suggest that walls will fall faster than the project's
founders imagine.
</P>
<P>
   To refugees, virtual travel is one of the Internet's most
tangible benefits. Palestinians in the West Bank cannot visit
compatriots in the Gaza Strip 110 kilometers (70 miles) away on the
Mediterranean coast unless they obtain hard-to-get permits from
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're unable to go to picnics, unable to go to the sea,
unable to go to movies in Jerusalem, it's like being in a prison
cell,'' said Mrs. Muhaisen, a 39-year-old Palestinian-American
journalist who is one of the project's main architects. ``Your
world becomes very limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Muhaisen was born in Jerusalem but lost her residency
rights during her parents' time in exile. The Internet provides her
with a ``way out'' of the 1-square-kilometer camp.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's Web site is geared toward young Palestinians who have
spent all their lives in camps. A section called ``Villages of
1948'' ensures that children know where their family homes were _
even though those villages have mostly been torn down or
incorporated into Israeli cities by now.
</P>
<P>
   A section devoted to ``Martyrs'' commemorates the camp residents
who died during the intifada, the Palestinian uprising that started
in the late 1980s. &QL;

`CRAZY IN ALABAMA': FREEDOM FIGHTING IN DIXIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Crazy in Alabama,'' a madcap woman named Lucille cuts off
her husband's head and heads off to meet her destiny, which she
hopes will involve the hit television series ``Bewitched'' (the
year is 1965) and an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the small Alabama town where most of the husband
remains, the Civil Rights Movement is challenging the segregated
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The story, written by Mark Childress from his lighthearted
novel, insists that in some way Lucille and the black citizens of
the Alabama town are actually part of the same struggle, all
fighting for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the film version of ``Crazy in Alabama'' takes an
antic tone. It presents Melanie Griffith as the kind of fanciful
creature who looks flirty even on her Wanted poster, and whose
escapades en route to Hollywood have a dizzy spin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Griffith, in a black wig, has to strain for the requisite
spontaneity, but she plays would-be starlet with enthusiasm.
There's a more lifelike performance from David Morse, who plays her
brother, the proprietor of a funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   The story is seen through the eyes of Peejoe (Lucas Black),
Lucille's young nephew, whose own experiences ultimately count for
more than Lucille's. Peejoe witnesses the brave attempt by Taylor
Jackson (Louis Miller Jr.) to integrate the town's whites-only
municipal swimming pool, and sees the tragic aftermath of that
confrontation. Both young actors give the film a compellingly
serious side, as does John Beasley as Taylor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging rights to the phrase ``the directorial debut of Antonio
Banderas,'' which has accompanied advertising for the film, are
within reason. Banderas directs capably enough to keep the film
lively, even if he lets a closing courtroom scene drone on
endlessly and allows Rod Steiger, as the judge, to chew up the
gavel. Though too many of its characters have personality to burn,
the film's own style is mostly unobtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mazursky and Robert Wagner turn up in a Hollywood section
of the film that actually does land Lucille on ``Bewitched.'' Here
and elsewhere on the road (driven by a chauffeur who exclaims
``What a woman!'' over Ms. Griffith), Lucille is inconveniently
distant from the film's Alabama scenes. Banderas simply cuts back
and forth, over and over, until the heroine flounces home.
</P>
<P>

   BANGKOK _ When top executives from stock markets around the
world sat down for a discreet closed-door discussion in Bangkok
this week the most recurrent theme was not recent market turmoil,
but the dangers of unregulated markets springing up on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of alternative systems for on-line electronic
trading kept popping up everywhere,'' said Gerrit de Marez Oyens,
secretary-general of the Federation International des Bourses de
Valeurs, which includes members representing 97 percent of the
world's market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern from traditional markets is that electronic
stock trading networks will dilute the inherent worthiness of stock
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization led by de Marez Oyens, known as FIBV, has a
membership that includes global players like the main markets in
London, Tokyo and New York, along with exchanges in developing
markets such as Lima, Tehran, Bangkok and Ljubljana, Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives from markets around the world expressed
fear that unchecked growth of unlinked, Internet-based markets
could fragment, undermine and dilute the value of stock prices
worldwide, de Marez Oyens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock trading could turn into an experience like shopping for
silk in a Thai market: an individual transaction that is completely
untransparent,'' de Marez Oyens said, referring to Internet stock
trading companies as ``parasitical services'' that exploit
regulatory investments made by traditional stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock markets pay for regulation, so why shouldn't the
parasites?'' de Marez Oyens said, noting that the New York Stock
Exchange employs a full-time staff of 500 regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulations make for a protected and orderly environment that
ensures transparency, fairness and people getting paid in time,''
he said. ``Most of these electronic trading companies probably
don't have a single person looking into regulatory issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So far there is only a fledgling group of U.S.-based electronic
stock trading networks, known as ECNs, whose users trade stock
outside traditional markets. These markets are small and unlinked,
which critics say can result in different prices for the same
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the explosive growth of on-line stock trading _ an
electronic extension of traditional markets, for now _ indicates
that ECNs, too, could prove wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that the discounts offered by on-line trading
services have been a democratizing force that has helped bring many
individual investors into the market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional markets have often failed to exploit opportunities
on the Internet, and in some cases entry costs for investors have
remained high, de Marez Oyens acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not enough to just call on-line companies
parasites,'' he said. ``We need to concentrate on why these
companies have been sprouting up and why their market share is
growing and where the traditional markets missed the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, de Marez Oyens said, nobody benefits if competing
ECNs make users unable to know the real price for a stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a drink at the bar and discover you paid ten bucks
more than your friend who bought the same stock almost at the same
time, you feel ripped off,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quickest solution, he added, is to allow on-line trading
systems to register as stock exchanges. ``If they are regulated
like stock exchanges, then traditional markets can compete with
them fairly for the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Internet, the demutualization under consideration by
44 of the FIBV's 52 members _ with several considering public stock
offerings _ will be a major force pushing for more
consumer-oriented stock markets, de Marez Oyens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users are not bound by membership rules or susceptible to peer
pressure,'' he said. ``It brings in a whole new culture when you
are forced to offer high-quality services at the lowest possible
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased awareness of consumer needs should help traditional
exchanges capture certain aspects of the business currently offered
by electronic trading networks, de Marez Oyens added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently we have left behind our business somewhere because
many of these alternative trading services actually offer the same
things we offered in the past.'' &QL;

   The quickest solution, he added, is to allow on-line trading
systems to register as stock exchanges. ``If they are regulated
like stock exchanges, then traditional markets can compete with
them fairly for the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Internet, the demutualization under consideration by
44 of the FIBV's 52 members _ with several considering public stock
offerings _ will be a major force pushing for more
consumer-oriented stock markets, de Marez Oyens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users are not bound by membership rules or susceptible to peer
pressure,'' he said. ``It brings in a whole new culture when you
are forced to offer high-quality services at the lowest possible
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased awareness of consumer needs should help traditional
exchanges capture certain aspects of the business currently offered
by electronic trading networks, de Marez Oyens added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently we have left behind our business somewhere because
many of these alternative trading services actually offer the same
things we offered in the past.'' &QL;

   QINGDAO, China _ A hot, sun-drenched summer day. Vines in neat,
disciplined rows climb the hillside behind you, the grapes ready to
be harvested, crushed and fermented in great barrels inside the
sprawling, whitewashed buildings below. Meanwhile, you admire the
wine, clear gold and deep purple, over a simple, delicious local
meal.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a scene anywhere in France, California's Napa
Valley or South Australia. Except that this is the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Years of experiments have led to breakthroughs on the Shandong
Peninsula, whose climate is uniquely suitable in Asia for
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   During China's Tang Dynasty, grape wine was imported from
Central Asia, where small amounts of port-like wine are still made
_ ``rooster's heart'' and ``cow's udder'' being two indigenous
varietals.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's climate, however, is generally inhospitable to
viniculture. Wine grapes need long days to ripen and dryness to
concentrate their juice; they are also very sensitive to cold.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's pervasive humidity and low latitudes present almost
insurmountable challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Shandong. The province stretches to the south of Beijing,
then juts out toward Korea, dividing the Gulf of Bohai from the
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean moderates the Siberian winters, while the northerly
latitude (similar to San Francisco's) and low summer humidity _ a
steady 60 percent _ allows temperate fruits like apples and
peaches, for which Shandong is famous, to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The first to recognize this potential was Zhang Bishi, a Qing
Dynasty official who founded the Chang Yu Winery near Yantai in
1892. Zhang brought vines from Europe and appointed Yantai's
Austrian consul as winemaker, but the winery today mostly makes a
localized kind of vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   The real trailblazer was an Englishman named Michael Parry, who
founded the Huadong Winery. Parry came to Hong Kong in 1973 as an
accountant, and drifted through a series of jobs before ending up
in the wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   As China started opening up after 1978, Parry became consumed
with the dream of producing first-class wine in China. In 1982 he
discovered the Shandong Peninsula, and with his partner Gabriel Tam
started convincing the local farmers to plant grapes where, in
marginal soil conditions, they had been growing sweet potatoes and
peanuts. In 1985, they planted 42,000 cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, a typhoon destroyed the vineyard, but
Parry persisted and replanted. By 1986, he was producing chardonnay
and riesling with the help of winemakers from California and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, having put up $1 million of his own
money, Parry went bankrupt and his stake (the joint-venture partner
was state-owned Tsingtao Winery) went to Hiram Walker, itself soon
bought by the British spirits company Allied-Domecq.
</P>
<P>
   Parry stayed on as adviser but his heart was broken. He died of
cancer two years later at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   His photograph hangs prominently at the winery's office _ a
giant of a man, with the glow of the bon vivant. His ashes are
buried on a hill overlooking the vineyard, and the farmers tend
reverently to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Huadong Winery sits among 14 hectares (35 acres) of a
steep, sun-facing basin in the Laoshan Mountains, 40 kilometers (25
miles) from Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape is sublime _ severe, forbidding crags soaring
above green summer fields. In the Chinese way of looking at things,
it's definitely Northern majesty, not Southern mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use this vineyard as a nursery,'' says George Zhao, the
winery's commercial manager. ``We sell cuttings all over the place
_ even Ningxia, Sichuan. People are planting vineyards all over
China.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also used to experiment with varieties like pinot noir and
gamay. Huadong's white wines, however, come from a larger vineyard,
400 hectares of chardonnay and riesling 120 kilometers to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soil is limy, sandy gravel,'' Zhao says. ``Useless for
most crops, but perfect for white wines.'' He adds that the
microclimate strongly resembles that of the region of France that
produces Beaujolais. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parry built the winery as a family residence, with living
quarters upstairs. They've since added a warehouse and cellar _ and
are building a guesthouse. ``Wine tourism,'' Zhao says, '' is the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about Huadong is how good their best
wines are. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The riesling is refreshing and aromatic, in the Alsatian style,
while the mildly oaked chardonnay is subtle and complex, almost
flinty like a chablis, more Burgundy than California.
</P>
<P>
   The red produced for the domestic market is forgettable, but the
winery is planning to produce a cabernet franc _ used in reds from
Touraine and Anjou in France _ from the 1999 vintage, and samples
from the barrel taste promising. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising because other Chinese wineries barely produce
anything recognizable as wine, much less good wine. Most of it,
anyhow, is drunk with Sprite or other mixers by status-conscious
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Chinese-owned Great Wall, Dragon Seal (a
joint-venture with Pernod-Ricard) and, the best of the lot,
Dynasty, a joint venture with Remy-Cointreau in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in 1980 as only the second joint venture in mainland
China, Dynasty produces small amounts of premium chardonnay that is
at least drinkable. Huadong says it's made with their surplus
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own our own vineyards just for that reason,'' says Lin
Keqiang, Huadong's general manager, ``to control the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, he says, is lack of government regulation.
``There are no AOC laws, no quality control. `Wine' only legally
needs to be 70 percent grape juice!''
</P>
<P>
   Li Peng's 1995 decree replacing baijiu, Chinese grain spirit,
with wine at banquets just led to officials drinking shots of wine
``down the hatch,'' like baijiu. Other obstacles include lack of
refrigerated storage.
</P>
<P>
   However erratic their support, Beijing does back the fledgling
wine industry, which after all produces a high-value product from
impoverished soils, not to mention freeing up scarce grain from
baijiu production and promoting healthier drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Duty on imported wine is 70 percent, clearly helping the locals
(even Huadong's premium wines sell for only 25 yuan or $3 in
China).
</P>
<P>
   But Huadong isn't satisfied with being the big fish in a small
pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the best wine in Asia,'' Lin says. Mellowing a
little after several glasses and some wonderful Shandongese
cooking, watching bees skim wildflowers beneath the surreal Laoshan
peaks, it's hard not to cheer them on. &QL;

`JOE THE KING' IS AN AFFECTING FILM ABOUT INNOCENCE LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This moving and woefully tender look at a young boy's troubled
adolescence, written and directed by actor Frank Whaley, shared the
screenwriting award at this year's Sundance Film Festival and was
nominated for the Grand Jury Prize as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King'' has enought simmering beneath its sweaty,
grimmy and disconsolate surface to be more than just another rite
of passage to young manhood missive set in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   It features a textured core performance by young Noah Fleiss,
who plays Joe, a 14-year-old who lives with his big brother Mike
(Max Ligosh), abusive and alcoholic dad Bob (Val Kilmer) and
tough-but-loving mom Theresa (Karen Young) in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Joe earns his street stripes in their downtrodden neighborhood
by committing petty thefts _ until he graduates to the big leagues
of crime in order to honor his family's debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King'' swirls and swaggers with visual surrealness
through this suburban slum, introducing us to the residents,
friends and enemies Joe encounters. His tough veneer hides a soft
heart and Fleiss allows us a glimpse into a boy's burgeoning
confusion. Joe is confident, frightened and fragile and walks a
tightrope between conformity and doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley elicits fine performances from his supporting actors,
with Kilmer acting against type as a dangerously unpredictable,
beer-guzzling, unemployed father and Young emitting a forgiving and
emotionally frazzled fierceness as Joe's frustrated mom. But it's
Fleiss, with his vulnerable eyes and impenetrable gaze, who breaks
hearts. Though each character is allowed a moment to display the
softness that has been sanded away by life's sorry twists and
turns, none merits mention more than this young stage and screen
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Though Whaley has some first-time director's trepidations over
how to end his film (I counted three consecutive endings; the
first, a poignant reconciliation scene between Kilmer and his son,
is the best, most powerful and necessary to the narrative), he's to
be commended for taking an overworked formula and breathing new
life into it. He's crafted an affecting film about innocence lost _
tragically perhaps never to be regained.

   QINGDAO, China _ A hot, sun-drenched summer day. Vines in neat,
disciplined rows climb the hillside behind you, the grapes ready to
be harvested, crushed and fermented in great barrels inside the
sprawling, whitewashed buildings below. Meanwhile, you admire the
wine, clear gold and deep purple, over a simple, delicious local
meal.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a scene anywhere in France, California's Napa
Valley or South Australia. Except that this is the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Years of experiments have led to breakthroughs on the Shandong
Peninsula, whose climate is uniquely suitable in Asia for
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   During China's Tang Dynasty, grape wine was imported from
Central Asia, where small amounts of port-like wine are still made
_ ``rooster's heart'' and ``cow's udder'' being two indigenous
varietals.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's climate, however, is generally inhospitable to
viniculture. Wine grapes need long days to ripen and dryness to
concentrate their juice; they are also very sensitive to cold.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's pervasive humidity and low latitudes present almost
insurmountable challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Shandong. The province stretches to the south of Beijing,
then juts out toward Korea, dividing the Gulf of Bohai from the
Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean moderates the Siberian winters, while the northerly
latitude (similar to San Francisco's) and low summer humidity _ a
steady 60 percent _ allows temperate fruits like apples and
peaches, for which Shandong is famous, to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The first to recognize this potential was Zhang Bishi, a Qing
Dynasty official who founded the Chang Yu Winery near Yantai in
1892. Zhang brought vines from Europe and appointed Yantai's
Austrian consul as winemaker, but the winery today mostly makes a
localized kind of vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   The real trailblazer was an Englishman named Michael Parry, who
founded the Huadong Winery. Parry came to Hong Kong in 1973 as an
accountant, and drifted through a series of jobs before ending up
in the wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   As China started opening up after 1978, Parry became consumed
with the dream of producing first-class wine in China. In 1982 he
discovered the Shandong Peninsula, and with his partner Gabriel Tam
started convincing the local farmers to plant grapes where, in
marginal soil conditions, they had been growing sweet potatoes and
peanuts. In 1985, they planted 42,000 cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, a typhoon destroyed the vineyard, but
Parry persisted and replanted. By 1986, he was producing chardonnay
and riesling with the help of winemakers from California and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, having put up $1 million of his own
money, Parry went bankrupt and his stake (the joint-venture partner
was state-owned Tsingtao Winery) went to Hiram Walker, itself soon
bought by the British spirits company Allied-Domecq.
</P>
<P>
   Parry stayed on as adviser but his heart was broken. He died of
cancer two years later at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   His photograph hangs prominently at the winery's office _ a
giant of a man, with the glow of the bon vivant. His ashes are
buried on a hill overlooking the vineyard, and the farmers tend
reverently to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Huadong Winery sits among 14 hectares (35 acres) of a
steep, sun-facing basin in the Laoshan Mountains, 40 kilometers (25
miles) from Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape is sublime _ severe, forbidding crags soaring
above green summer fields. In the Chinese way of looking at things,
it's definitely Northern majesty, not Southern mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use this vineyard as a nursery,'' says George Zhao, the
winery's commercial manager. ``We sell cuttings all over the place
_ even Ningxia, Sichuan. People are planting vineyards all over
China.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also used to experiment with varieties like pinot noir and
gamay. Huadong's white wines, however, come from a larger vineyard,
400 hectares of chardonnay and riesling 120 kilometers to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soil is limy, sandy gravel,'' Zhao says. ``Useless for
most crops, but perfect for white wines.'' He adds that the
microclimate strongly resembles that of the region of France that
produces Beaujolais. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parry built the winery as a family residence, with living
quarters upstairs. They've since added a warehouse and cellar _ and
are building a guesthouse. ``Wine tourism,'' Zhao says, '' is the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about Huadong is how good their best
wines are. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The riesling is refreshing and aromatic, in the Alsatian style,
while the mildly oaked chardonnay is subtle and complex, almost
flinty like a chablis, more Burgundy than California.
</P>
<P>
   The red produced for the domestic market is forgettable, but the
winery is planning to produce a cabernet franc _ used in reds from
Touraine and Anjou in France _ from the 1999 vintage, and samples
from the barrel taste promising. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising because other Chinese wineries barely produce
anything recognizable as wine, much less good wine. Most of it,
anyhow, is drunk with Sprite or other mixers by status-conscious
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Chinese-owned Great Wall, Dragon Seal (a
joint-venture with Pernod-Ricard) and, the best of the lot,
Dynasty, a joint venture with Remy-Cointreau in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in 1980 as only the second joint venture in mainland
China, Dynasty produces small amounts of premium chardonnay that is
at least drinkable. Huadong says it's made with their surplus
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own our own vineyards just for that reason,'' says Lin
Keqiang, Huadong's general manager, ``to control the quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, he says, is lack of government regulation.
``There are no AOC laws, no quality control. `Wine' only legally
needs to be 70 percent grape juice!''
</P>
<P>
   Li Peng's 1995 decree replacing baijiu, Chinese grain spirit,
with wine at banquets just led to officials drinking shots of wine
``down the hatch,'' like baijiu. Other obstacles include lack of
refrigerated storage.
</P>
<P>
   However erratic their support, Beijing does back the fledgling
wine industry, which after all produces a high-value product from
impoverished soils, not to mention freeing up scarce grain from
baijiu production and promoting healthier drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Duty on imported wine is 70 percent, clearly helping the locals
(even Huadong's premium wines sell for only 25 yuan or $3 in
China).
</P>
<P>
   But Huadong isn't satisfied with being the big fish in a small
pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the best wine in Asia,'' Lin says. Mellowing a
little after several glasses and some wonderful Shandongese
cooking, watching bees skim wildflowers beneath the surreal Laoshan
peaks, it's hard not to cheer them on. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, died after he had
voluntarily left office, still respected by his people. To this
extent alone, he set himself apart from many of his fellows in that
small club of African men who guided their countries to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast Kwame Nkrumah, the first to break from Britain's
colonial grip when the Gold Coast became Ghana in 1957, was
transformed during his reign from a charming and popular natural
leader to a diabolic force who built statues to himself, undermined
the judiciary, and left his opponents to rot in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Nkrumah path has been more frequently travelled by
African leaders than Nyerere's.
</P>
<P>
   Mobutu, Bokassa, Banda, Amin, and many others, all used their
office to fatten their foreign bank accounts and further their
megalomaniac ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Their ideology _ usually an ill-defined and sentimental
nationalism _ was the thinnest of disguises for crude kleptocracy.
Much wickedness progressed under the guise of the ``African way''
of running things.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, too, tried to find an African way forward for Tanzania.
He thought the continent was a natural home of socialism, that
sharing and cooperation were the norm for pre-colonial African
society, and that post-colonial leaders would be able to resurrect
this heritage with ease.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to organize Tanzania into a system of collective
villages. But the peasants, as they had done before, worked for
themselves, and only pretended to work on communal plots. The
economy stagnated, and corruption was endemic.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the villages was a hard lesson. But there was one
legacy of Nyerere's ``ujamaa'' socialism that blesses Tanzania to
this day: it defused the country's ethnic rivalries _ divisions
that blight every country on the continent, providing so often a
pretext for ambitious men to grab power.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations _ Nigeria, Angola _ have only themselves to blame
for their poverty. They have the resources, but abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania has precious few resources. But at least the only war
it has fought in recent times was to enter Uganda and remove the
appalling Idi Amin from power.
</P>
<P>
   A leader can make a difference. There are very few in Africa who
have made a difference for the better _ Nelson Mandela is the
outstanding example. Perhaps Nyerere should also belong to this
too-small club. &QL;

'THE LOONEY TUNES HALL OF FAME': WITH THAT WASCALLY WABBIT

<P>
   Operatic rabbits, enigmatic frogs, vexatious birds and hotheaded
hunters and hombres are running amok in Manhattan, and there's
still more than a week to go before Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the mischief and mayhem are confined (barely)
to the screen of Cinema Village, where Bugs Bunny, the singing
Frog, Tweetie Pie, Road Runner, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam, among
other cutups, are on the loose in ``The Looney Tunes Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Valuable history and ample family fun, this compilation of 15
classic Warner Brothers cartoons spans the years 1940 to 1995, an
era of ingenious Hollywood animated shorts that began as program
fillers but earned acknowledgment as art, and of directors who
began their careers as Charles M. Jones and I. Freleng, then
achieved fame and accolades as Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng.
</P>
<P>
   Expressions like ``what's up, doc?'' and ``that's all folks''
entered the language through these films, and by giving memorable
voice to a multitude of characters, Mel Blanc, too, won
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The energy, talent and creativity of Jones and Freleng are
everywhere in ``The Looney Tunes Hall of Fame,'' whose merry
madness includes two cartoons enshrined in the National Film
Registry: Jones' ``Duck Amuck'' (1953), a frenetic excursion into
the art of animation in which Daffy Duck finds out who's really
running the show, and ``What's Opera, Doc,'' Jones' sendup of
Wagner, with Elmer Fudd as the horn-helmeted hero and Bugs Bunny as
his blond-braided Brunnhilde.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, are ``The Wild Hare'' (1940), the debut vehicle for
Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd as co-stars, with the shotgun-toting
Elmer as the hunter and Bugs as the frustratingly elusive quarry
who teaches him a lesson, and ``Bugs Bunny Rides Again,'' a clever
satire of westerns with Yosemite Sam and Bugs as the gun-packing
objects of mischief created by some of the fastest drawers in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic singing frog (``Michigan Rag,'' et al.) that is
recovered from a cornerstone at a demolition site by a construction
worker who dreams of glory as the amphibian's impresario turns up
not once but twice. Having driven his rescuer mad with his refusal
to sing in public in Jones' ``One Froggy Evening'' (1955), the
creature returns in a prequel and sequel that bound from earthly
prehistory to the interplanetary future in ``Another Froggy
Evening'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbit Seasoning'' (1952), pitting Bugs and Daffy Duck against
Elmer Fudd; ``Knightly Knight Bugs'' (1955), in which a medieval
Bugs squares off against the dark knight of Yosemite Sam and his
not-too-bright dragon, and the climactic ``Rabbit of Seville''
(1956), another opera pastiche, with Bugs as barber and Elmer as
his prey, are among other highlights of an altogether entertaining
show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Willie Brown first contemplated running for
mayor of San Francisco, he wasn't sure the job could hold his
interest. ``Street lights, dog-doo and parking meters are not my
cup of tea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. Four years into the job, and with a
monumental reelection battle in progress, he can safely say his
life is anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   He has officiated at mass gay weddings, appointed the Beat
figurehead Lawrence Ferlinghetti as his very own Poet Laureate,
although Ferlinghetti is yet to oblige with a single poem, and has
been on the receiving end of three cream pies thrown by an
agit-prop group called the Bionic Baking Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   On the 50th birthday of his campaign manager, Jack Davis, he and
the cream of San Francisco society were treated to a startling
sadomasochistic sex show in which two performers lacerated each
others' backs, performed Satanic rituals and put a Jack Daniels
bottle to unspeakable uses.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of boredom has not made Brown popular, however. Lambasted
for his harsh treatment of the homeless population and his
painfully slow progress in fixing the bus system, his would-be
successors are now sharpening their knives over everything from his
choice of district attorney _ who has the worst conviction record
in the city's history and likes to throw punches, even in court _
to his uncanny knack of making friends with construction magnates
grown rich on city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   With election day under a month away, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is crawling all over city offices to investigate
allegations that contracts earmarked for companies run by ethnic
minorities are going to shell organizations acting as fronts for
powerful white friends of the man winkingly known as ``Da Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is throwing every ounce of his considerable energy into a
grand theatrical campaign. Determined not to appear defensive, he
has organized groups of hecklers to drown out his rivals at mayoral
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to pick up every last vote, his reelection committee has
been trawling through every old age home and housing project to
register poor and minority voters who can be talked into supporting
him, if only because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, they have even been visiting county
jails to register eligible inmates.
</P>
<P>
   If the political battles in San Francisco seem theatrical, then
they are complemented perfectly by the goings-on across the bay in
Oakland, where another famous Brown _ former California governor
Jerry Brown _ is settling into his first term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric radical, who briefly gave up politics to study at
Mother Teresa's knee, kicked off his term with a mass meditation
ceremony and has since invited everyone from the Black Panthers to
the U.S. Marine Corps to join his idiosyncratic campaign to revive
the gritty industrial city.
</P>
<P>
   The two Browns are having an electric effect on Bay Area
politics, since both have a sure talent for attracting attention
and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie, a famously suave dresser, was pied by the Bionic
Baking Brigade he stunned just about everyone by applying the full
pressure of the law against the perpetrators and having them
sentenced to six months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry the pacifist invited the Marines into Oakland for
three days of noisy war games, he infuriated his city council. One
member said the only benefit to the local economy would be
increased custom for the city's prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It guaranteed reams of local media coverage. How much either of
them is achieving in office is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has already modified his pledge to provide 10,000 new
units of affordable housing in downtown Oakland _ dropping the
commitment to affordability.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone back on his pledge to community-based policing,
encouraging an orthodox tough-on-crime approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Hilliard, the former black radical who returned
enthusiastically to Oakland, saying that Jerry Brown sounded ``more
like a Black Panther every day,'' now says the mayor has sold the
African-American community down the river.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, a radical, now says: ``He's not a team
player. He is conscious of what he needs to do to be reelected and
focuses on meeting those political needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar in San Francisco, where Willie Brown failed
to fix Muni, the municipal transport system, in 100 days as he had
promised. He hasn't fixed it more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, faced with an unprecedented housing boom, he has torn down
far more low-income housing than he has created.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is a politician's politician, a man who survived more
than 15 years as Speaker of the California state assembly and
earned a national reputation as a deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite abysmal approval ratings, he has engineered an
electoral landscape in which the other candidates are even less
popular.
</P>
<P>
   One challenger, the former police chief Frank Jordan, has made
almost no headway in obliterating the lukewarm memories of his
tenure as mayor in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career blew up in his face on the eve of the 1995
election when, incredibly, two radio shock jocks from Los Angeles
managed to talk their way into his house and persuaded him to climb
into the shower with them for an all-naked interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan evidently thought the interview would increase his appeal
with young voters, but when pictures of the occasion made the local
papers he became the laughingstock of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's other challenger, Clint Reilly, is a political
consultant with strong links to the property and insurance worlds _
links that have made it impossible for him to attack Brown for his
own considerable deference to ``special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie will win because he's smarter than everyone else,''
remarked Jo Schuman Silver, a theatrical impresario well connected
to the Brown camp.
</P>
<P>
   And so, San Francisco can look forward to another four years of
Willie. It won't be scintillating politics, perhaps, but it is sure
to be great theatre. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Willie Brown first contemplated running for
mayor of San Francisco, he wasn't sure the job could hold his
interest. ``Street lights, dog-doo and parking meters are not my
cup of tea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. Four years into the job, and with a
monumental reelection battle in progress, he can safely say his
life is anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   He has officiated at mass gay weddings, appointed the Beat
figurehead Lawrence Ferlinghetti as his very own Poet Laureate,
although Ferlinghetti is yet to oblige with a single poem, and has
been on the receiving end of three cream pies thrown by an
agit-prop group called the Bionic Baking Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   On the 50th birthday of his campaign manager, Jack Davis, he and
the cream of San Francisco society were treated to a startling
sadomasochistic sex show in which two performers lacerated each
others' backs, performed Satanic rituals and put a Jack Daniels
bottle to unspeakable uses.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of boredom has not made Brown popular, however. Lambasted
for his harsh treatment of the homeless population and his
painfully slow progress in fixing the bus system, his would-be
successors are now sharpening their knives over everything from his
choice of district attorney _ who has the worst conviction record
in the city's history and likes to throw punches, even in court _
to his uncanny knack of making friends with construction magnates
grown rich on city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   With election day under a month away, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is crawling all over city offices to investigate
allegations that contracts earmarked for companies run by ethnic
minorities are going to shell organizations acting as fronts for
powerful white friends of the man winkingly known as ``Da Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is throwing every ounce of his considerable energy into a
grand theatrical campaign. Determined not to appear defensive, he
has organized groups of hecklers to drown out his rivals at mayoral
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to pick up every last vote, his reelection committee has
been trawling through every old age home and housing project to
register poor and minority voters who can be talked into supporting
him, if only because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, they have even been visiting county
jails to register eligible inmates.
</P>
<P>
   If the political battles in San Francisco seem theatrical, then
they are complemented perfectly by the goings-on across the bay in
Oakland, where another famous Brown _ former California governor
Jerry Brown _ is settling into his first term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric radical, who briefly gave up politics to study at
Mother Teresa's knee, kicked off his term with a mass meditation
ceremony and has since invited everyone from the Black Panthers to
the U.S. Marine Corps to join his idiosyncratic campaign to revive
the gritty industrial city.
</P>
<P>
   The two Browns are having an electric effect on Bay Area
politics, since both have a sure talent for attracting attention
and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie, a famously suave dresser, was pied by the Bionic
Baking Brigade he stunned just about everyone by applying the full
pressure of the law against the perpetrators and having them
sentenced to six months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry the pacifist invited the Marines into Oakland for
three days of noisy war games, he infuriated his city council. One
member said the only benefit to the local economy would be
increased custom for the city's prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It guaranteed reams of local media coverage. How much either of
them is achieving in office is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has already modified his pledge to provide 10,000 new
units of affordable housing in downtown Oakland _ dropping the
commitment to affordability.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone back on his pledge to community-based policing,
encouraging an orthodox tough-on-crime approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Hilliard, the former black radical who returned
enthusiastically to Oakland, saying that Jerry Brown sounded ``more
like a Black Panther every day,'' now says the mayor has sold the
African-American community down the river.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, a radical, now says: ``He's not a team
player. He is conscious of what he needs to do to be reelected and
focuses on meeting those political needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar in San Francisco, where Willie Brown failed
to fix Muni, the municipal transport system, in 100 days as he had
promised. He hasn't fixed it more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, faced with an unprecedented housing boom, he has torn down
far more low-income housing than he has created.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is a politician's politician, a man who survived more
than 15 years as Speaker of the California state assembly and
earned a national reputation as a deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite abysmal approval ratings, he has engineered an
electoral landscape in which the other candidates are even less
popular.
</P>
<P>
   One challenger, the former police chief Frank Jordan, has made
almost no headway in obliterating the lukewarm memories of his
tenure as mayor in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career blew up in his face on the eve of the 1995
election when, incredibly, two radio shock jocks from Los Angeles
managed to talk their way into his house and persuaded him to climb
into the shower with them for an all-naked interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan evidently thought the interview would increase his appeal
with young voters, but when pictures of the occasion made the local
papers he became the laughingstock of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's other challenger, Clint Reilly, is a political
consultant with strong links to the property and insurance worlds _

own considerable deference to ``special interests.''
</P>

   And so, San Francisco can look forward to another four years of

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Botticelli With a Hitch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Timothy Potts became director of the Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth a year ago, he began doing what museum directors
typically do: searching the world for great works of art to
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Potts isn't concerned about filling gaps in the museum's
collection because the Kimbell doesn't bill itself as having
encyclopedic holdings. He is hunting art that would enrich its
world-class collection. But his mission isn't easy: there are few
outstanding paintings and objects left on the market, and when they
do appear there are often complications.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Potts jumped at Botticelli's ``Virgin Adoring the
Christ Child'' (circa 1480), which he hopes will be his first
acquisition for the Kimbell. Great Botticelli's are rare, and this
one comes with a particularly pristine provenance.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was owned by Lord Northwick, a great collector who
presided over two well-known stately English homes, Norwick Park in
Gloucestershire and Thirlestane House in Cheltenham. In 1859 Lord
Northwick sold the Botticelli to Lord Elcho, and the painting has
descended through his family, ending up with the present Earl of
Wemyss. The Botticelli has been at Gosford House, the Wemyss home
in Scotland, and has not been seen publicly for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Wemyss Heirloom Trust is the painting's legal owner. As with
many titled English families, the trust owns and oversees the
running of the family's two homes (the other is in England) and
needs money for preserving them.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is getting an export license to allow the painting
to leave Britain. While the National Gallery of Art in London has
seven signed Botticelli's, the National Galleries of Scotland has
none. An application for an export license is expected to be
deferred by the government to see if any British institution or
collector will match the price the Kimbell is willing to pay,
reportedly $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Sargent, a spokesman for the Department of National
Heritage in London, said an application for an export license was
expected. He predicted it would be deferred for three months; then,
if no one matchs the Kimbell's price, the Botticelli will go to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purchase of the painting has effectively been agreed
upon,'' Potts said, implying that no sale contract had been signed
but that the terms had been ironed out. ``But the export permit
process can be a lengthy one. And the outcome is never assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts who have seen the painting say it is everything anyone
would want in a Botticelli: one of the great images of the
Renaissance artist, richly detailed and beautifully rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Simon C. Dickinson, the Old Master dealer who has galleries in
London and New York, has known the Wemyss collection for years, and
it is his firm, Dickinson Roundell, that is brokering the deal.
Rachel Mauro, the managing director of Dickinson Roundell in New
York, confirmed the gallery's involvement but declined to comment
on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell is not the first American museum to find itself
stymied by the Department of National Heritage. The J. Paul Getty
Museum in Los Angeles was able to get a Poussin landscape from
Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire two years ago, but earlier it had
to wait five years before learning it could not have Canova's
``Three Graces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised and delighted if the money could be
raised for the Botticelli,'' Sargent said. ``But it's a colossal
amount of money, and I can't pretend to be optimistic about it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ebay Goes Upscale &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to raise the price range of the merchandise it
offers, Ebay has created a new Web site, called Ebay Great
Collections. Users can click on Great Collections from Ebay's
original homepage (ebay.com), and buy and sell everything from
fossilized pine cones to Hepplewhite armchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of Sotheby's, which this year announced its
online auctions plans in an alliance with Amazon.com, Ebay will
have dealers and other auction houses as partners. But while
Sotheby's counts on its brand name to lure buyers, Ebay hopes to
entice its registered 5.6 million users to keep spending bigger
sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   When Sotheby's site becomes available early next year, only
dealers will be able to offer things for sale, but on Ebay Great
Collections anybody can be a seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be accessible to everyone,'' said Meg Whitman,
president and chief executive officer of Ebay. ``We've created a
level playing field at your fingertips where anyone can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman said the company was taking its ``high-end buyers''
_ those who spend more than $250 _ and marrying them to higher-end
merchandise. She said she envisioned the price range to be from
$250 to $10,000 and that over time she expected it to go even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came six months after Ebay spent $260 million
for Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, the San Francisco auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay charges a 7.5 percent seller's fee but no buyer's premium.
Sotheby's.Amazon.com will charge a 10 percent buyer's premium and
no seller's fee. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moving Around &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neal Benezra, assistant director for art and public programs at
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, has been
named deputy director of the Art Institute of Chicago and head of
its department of 20th-century art. He replaces Jeremy Strict, who
left Chicago in July to be the director of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Benezra begins his new post in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Weiss, a curator of 20th-century art at the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, has just been named head of the
gallery's department of modern and contemporary art. He is
replacing Marla Prather, who will become curator of postwar art at
the Whitney Museum of American Art in January.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The clash at the paper mill has only confirmed that
nearly a decade after the collapse of communism, capitalist Russia
remains a wild environment for foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries Western merchants have come to Russia, hoping to
tap its enormous potential, only to go away again bewildered by
this country, which is neither truly European nor fully Asian but a
maddening law unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Alcem, the British company, now risks losing its investment. But
some Western businessmen have come to Russia and lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The most shocking case was probably that of the American
entrepreneur Paul Tatum, who had a joint stake in the
Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to turn what had been a dreary Intourist hotel into an
establishment fit to receive U.S. President Bill Clinton when he
visited Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners tried to sideline him. He was in the
process of fighting them in court. They used other methods to end
the argument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was shot dead in an underpass near the Kiev railway
station. He was accompanied by two bodyguards, both of whom
survived, leaving him alone in a pool of his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum had come to Russia at a time when foreigners were allowed
to have a partial involvement in business here.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Bolshevik Revolution, there were many foreign firms,
for example the Scottish department store Muir and Mirrielees,
which was to Moscow what Selfridges is to London or Jenners to
Edinburgh. But after 1917, everything was nationalized and
collectivized.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his perestroika reforms, Russian President Mikhail
Gorbachev allowed ``joint ventures,'' in which foreigners could
have a maximum of 49 percent but the controlling share remained
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Only under President Boris Yeltsin, who took market reforms
further, were foreigners able to buy the factories, like the pulp
and paper mill, that had failed under communism.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are some success stories, such as that of Inchcape
which, to everyone's satisfaction, has built a profitable bottling
plant for Coca-Cola in the Urals, or Procter and Gamble, which
dominates the market in hygiene products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's economic crisis frightened many foreigners away but
business analysts say that Russia remains a land of opportunity for
those who are prepared to be patient and take the long-term
approach.
</P>
<P>
   However, many have fallen by the wayside before they could enjoy
the fruits of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The British have always been cautious here, more so than the
Americans or the Germans. There was a time when, out of all
proportion to the size of their country, the Irish were active in
Moscow. But many of them have gone quietly, not waiting, as Paul
Tatum did, for things to turn nasty.
</P>
<P>
   There was a man called Colm Fitzsimmons, who managed a corner
shop called the ``Garden Ring Irish Supermarket.'' His imported
groceries were outrageously expensive but he pulled in crowds of
customers with his personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   He gave to charity, he sponsored the arts. He sponsored the
first ever performance in Moscow of Handel's ``Messiah,'' with an
expatriate choir and a Russian orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners took over the store. The price of the
groceries went up even further while the service became sullen and
Soviet-like. The customers deserted it in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it closed and now on the site, somebody else is
trying to make a go of a shop selling sports clothes. &QL;

   There was a man called Colm Fitzsimmons, who managed a corner
shop called the ``Garden Ring Irish Supermarket.'' His imported
groceries were outrageously expensive but he pulled in crowds of
customers with his personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   He gave to charity, he sponsored the arts. He sponsored the
first ever performance in Moscow of Handel's ``Messiah,'' with an
expatriate choir and a Russian orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners took over the store. The price of the
groceries went up even further while the service became sullen and
Soviet-like. The customers deserted it in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it closed and now on the site, somebody else is
trying to make a go of a shop selling sports clothes. &QL;

   In a decade's time there will be no more than six big car makers
left in the world, if the predictions of the auto industry pundits
prove correct.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic surgery being carried out at Nissan by its new
French masters is designed to ensure they are one of them.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecasters are correct _ and they include some eminent
industry figures such as Sir Alex Trotman, the former chairman of
Ford _ then early in the next millennium the car market will be
carved up between two American, two European and two Asian
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The process of consolidation is gathering speed. Most of the
minnows of the automotive world have already been absorbed into
larger, more financially robust, companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo are now part of Ford while
General Motors owns Saab, and Volkswagen of Germany owns Audi,
Seat, Skoda and Bentley. BMW, meanwhile, owns Rover, and in three
years' time will take control of the Rolls-Royce marque. Fiat owns
Lancia and Alfa Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only the smaller players that have been scooped
up. Eighteen months ago, Daimler-Benz of Germany and Chrysler of
the U.S. stunned the auto industry by unveiling a $40 billion
merger.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, creating the world's fourth biggest car maker behind
General Motors, Ford and Toyota, confounded conventional wisdom in
that it was a European car maker buying a competitor in another
continent. The Renault-Nissan deal is in the same mould.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is now waiting to see who will merge next. The
world car industry has the capacity to produce 40 percent more cars
than it sells each year while each new model can cost up to (pounds
sterling)600 million to develop. The cost savings that a successful
merger can bring are therefore enormous.
</P>
<P>
   But so are the political headaches because any combination of
two volume car makers in Europe or Asia would spell tens of
thousands of job losses.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are frequent suggestions that Renault and Citroen
will ultimately merge, the most likely pairing in Europe may turn
out to be a merger between Fiat and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the two French car makers, their contrasting model ranges
and geographic markets would probably mean limited job and plant
closures - perhaps none at all.
</P>
<P>
   The real prize comes in reducing the cost of future model
production by building a series of vehicles on what is known as a
single platform -- engine, gearbox, transmission, axle and
floorpan.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Nissan, Renault intends to reduce the number of
different platforms from 24 to 15. In the future, Renault cars
might by built on Nissan platforms and vice versa in Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a smaller scale the cost savings are significant. The
new baby Jaguar, which will emerge from Ford's Halewood plant in
two years, will be constructed around the platform of the Mondeo. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Wall Street opened for business Monday morning
it was not only investors, big and small, who waited in trepidation
to see which way the markets would move.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls who are already battling to succeed
President Bill Clinton were on tenterhooks, too, because a
sustained downturn in the longest peacetime boom the United States
has ever known could fundamentally change the political arithmetic
for next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been a prevailing consensus, fueled by the
innate optimism of the current generation of Americans, that the
boom could only continue.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, however, the mood started to change.
The previous five days had seen the steepest fall in share prices
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a veiled warning to the banks from the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, about market volatility
combined with an unexpectedly sharp increase in wholesale prices in
September to send the Dow Jones plunging more than 250 points in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   It even dipped briefly below the symbolic 10,000 points for the
first time since April, registering a fall of a full 12 percent
from the record 11,326 struck in August.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Wall Street Journal was awash with cautious
pessimism. ``Return to 10,000 _ Is this bear territory?'' read the
main headline of the investment section.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside, the second headline was even more worrying: ``Fed's
credibility as inflation foe may be weakening.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a very long time, doubts were being raised
about the judgment of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve and hero of the Clinton economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as six weeks ago, next year's presidential
candidates were pleading with Clinton to reappoint Greenspan early
for another term.
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted to avoid the chairmanship of the Fed becoming a
political issue on the eve of the election and worried that
attendant uncertainty could upset the markets. Now, they could be
overtaken by events.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who has most to lose from a serious downturn in
the economy would undoubtedly be Vice-President Al Gore. The
prosperity in which America has basked through Bill Clinton's
presidency is one of his strongest suits, and the one that Clinton
cites first when he campaigns on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling off a string of statistics: economic growth, income,
unemployment, he invites his audience to compare America now with
America when he came to office. ``Do you want more of the same?''
his implied message runs, ``Just vote for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the economy could outweigh much of the negative
baggage from the Clinton presidency that drags down Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Remove that advantage, though, and the Gore campaign looks much
weaker; the candidate will be left having to explain how he would
set about reviving an economic boom amid falling expectations, and
a far more pessimistic national mood.
</P>
<P>
   He would also be left _ as would all the other candidates _
explaining to voters how he would pay for his string of election
promises if it suddenly looked as though the much-heralded domestic
budget surplus was not going to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, economic bad news could provide a
windfall for Bill Bradley. Not only is he not associated with the
White House _ a distinct plus if Clinton bequeaths an ailing
economy as well as the integrity issue to his vice-president _ he
has also positioned himself politically to the left of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's unashamed recognition of the have-nots and his
promises of a more ``inclusive'' America could have more resonance
if the number of have-nots _ and those who perceived themselves as
such _ increases.
</P>
<P>
   Falling share prices would leave America's new generation of
private investors downcast (and out of pocket); it could also
depress wages, increase joblessness and endanger welfare reform
(which has succeeded so far largely because of the number of jobs
available).
</P>
<P>
   Job insecurity could also revive pressure for universal health
insurance, bringing Clinton's presidency full circle on health
policy. Bradley has already had something to say on all these
issues, and would need to change little in his campaign pitch to
appear a man for his times.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading Republican contender, George W. Bush, is also
neatly positioned to capitalize on Clinton-Gore economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks he has separated himself from Congressional
Republicans, accusing them of being unduly hardhearted towards the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   And only last week, he told New Yorkers: ``Too often my party
has focused on the national economy to the exclusion of all else _
speaking a sterile language of rates and numbers, of CBO/Central
Budget Office/this and GNP that...''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the economy thrives, such words convey the message to
voters that the prosperity of the Clinton presidency is not
everything. They could be easily adapted to leaner economic times,
however, offering reassurance to those who have lost out
economically and competing with Bradley's appeal to the newly
insecure.
</P>
<P>
   A further winner could be Pat Buchanan, the conservative
Republican who is on the verge of defecting to the Reform Party in
the hope of becoming that party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is the candidate of the right who is most forcefully
protectionist, a message that will fall on fertile ground if
unemployment rises.
</P>
<P>
   Any gain in votes for Buchanan, however, is likely to be Bush's
loss, harming his chances and making it more likely that a Democrat
returns to the White House. &QL;

first time since April, registering a fall of a full 12 percent
from the record 11,326 struck in August.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Wall Street Journal was awash with cautious
pessimism. ``Return to 10,000 _ Is this bear territory?'' read the
main headline of the investment section.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside, the second headline was even more worrying: ``Fed's
credibility as inflation foe may be weakening.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a very long time, doubts were being raised
about the judgment of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve and hero of the Clinton economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as six weeks ago, next year's presidential
candidates were pleading with Clinton to reappoint Greenspan early
for another term.
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted to avoid the chairmanship of the Fed becoming a
political issue on the eve of the election and worried that
attendant uncertainty could upset the markets. Now, they could be
overtaken by events.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who has most to lose from a serious downturn in
the economy would undoubtedly be Vice-President Al Gore. The
prosperity in which America has basked through Bill Clinton's
presidency is one of his strongest suits, and the one that Clinton
cites first when he campaigns on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling off a string of statistics: economic growth, income,
unemployment, he invites his audience to compare America now with
America when he came to office. ``Do you want more of the same?''
his implied message runs, ``Just vote for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the economy could outweigh much of the negative
baggage from the Clinton presidency that drags down Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Remove that advantage, though, and the Gore campaign looks much
weaker; the candidate will be left having to explain how he would
set about reviving an economic boom amid falling expectations, and
a far more pessimistic national mood.
</P>
<P>
   He would also be left _ as would all the other candidates _
explaining to voters how he would pay for his string of election
promises if it suddenly looked as though the much-heralded domestic
budget surplus was not going to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, economic bad news could provide a
windfall for Bill Bradley. Not only is he not associated with the
White House _ a distinct plus if Clinton bequeaths an ailing
economy as well as the integrity issue to his vice-president _ he
has also positioned himself politically to the left of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's unashamed recognition of the have-nots and his
promises of a more ``inclusive'' America could have more resonance
if the number of have-nots _ and those who perceived themselves as
such _ increases.
</P>
<P>
   Falling share prices would leave America's new generation of
private investors downcast (and out of pocket); it could also
depress wages, increase joblessness and endanger welfare reform
(which has succeeded so far largely because of the number of jobs
available).
</P>
<P>
   Job insecurity could also revive pressure for universal health
insurance, bringing Clinton's presidency full circle on health
policy. Bradley has already had something to say on all these
issues, and would need to change little in his campaign pitch to
appear a man for his times.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading Republican contender, George W. Bush, is also
neatly positioned to capitalize on Clinton-Gore economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks he has separated himself from Congressional
Republicans, accusing them of being unduly hardhearted towards the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   And only last week, he told New Yorkers: ``Too often my party
has focused on the national economy to the exclusion of all else _
speaking a sterile language of rates and numbers, of CBO/Central
Budget Office/this and GNP that...''
</P>
<P>
   So long as the economy thrives, such words convey the message to
voters that the prosperity of the Clinton presidency is not
everything. They could be easily adapted to leaner economic times,
however, offering reassurance to those who have lost out
economically and competing with Bradley's appeal to the newly
insecure.
</P>
<P>
   A further winner could be Pat Buchanan, the conservative
Republican who is on the verge of defecting to the Reform Party in
the hope of becoming that party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is the candidate of the right who is most forcefully
protectionist, a message that will fall on fertile ground if
unemployment rises.
</P>
<P>
   Any gain in votes for Buchanan, however, is likely to be Bush's
loss, harming his chances and making it more likely that a Democrat
returns to the White House. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin had no shortage of party
tricks to entertain his host Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace
Tuesday night, for the man who heads up China's state, Communist
Party and army is also a past master at playing to the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   A deft hand at bridge and playing the piano, the 73-year-old
Chinese leader is also a demon karaoke fan and he may have even
crooned a rendition of Elvis Presley's ``Love Me Tender,'' as he
did back in 1996 when he visited Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jiang may have shown off his knowledge of
Western culture for the Queen with off-the-cuff recitals from
Shelly and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Oct. 1, he was stony-faced, inspecting troops in
a dour Mao suit for Beijing's 50th anniversary parade. But his
message for London and the Queen is that China means business, so
an immaculate Western business suit is the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang was propelled from Shanghai party chief into the hot seat
of Communist Party boss back in 1989 by the political purges that
surrounded the army massacre of pro-democracy students in Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   At that time he was derided as ``the flower pot'' _ for being
decorative but ineffectual _ and many predicted he would not stay
atop the Chinese dragon for long.
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang's chameleon tendencies have served him well, and he is
looking to this European tour to put the finishing touches on his
ascendancy to the ranks of his two communist predecessors, Mao
Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind those Buddy Holly glasses, Jiang is a very intelligent
and shrewd politician,'' said William Ward, a U.S. academic who
lived in China in the 1980s and often played bridge with Jiang when
he was the mayor and party secretary of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a communist revolutionary martyr, Jiang was born in
the southeastern coastal province of Jiangsu in the year of the
tiger 1926, making him an exact contemporary of the Queen In 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a year in Russia at the labyrinthine Stalin Autoworks,
where he picked up a good knowledge of Russian _ he can still
recite the opening lines of ``Anna Karenina.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jiang hovered around the edges of the momentous political
events of his youth, surviving Maoist purges by keeping his head
down, and using his training as an electrical engineer to plod up
through China's heavy industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   His political career did not take off until 1986 when he became
Shanghai mayor. In the same year, he had his first encounter with
the Queen, hosting her in China's financial center during her state
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But his next brush with British royalty did not come until 1997
when he met Prince Charles during the handover of Hong Kong. By
that time, he was fully installed in Beijing as the undisputed heir
to Deng, who had died earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   His nation had recorded its fastest period of economic growth of
this century, and Western imports, from McDonalds to the Spice
Girls, abounded.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes that the third generation of Communist leadership in
China would lead to political reforms have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jiang's frequent use of the word ``democracy,''
political dissidents are regularly imprisoned for expressing their
views. In July, Jiang outlawed the Falun Gong meditation group as a
threat to state security.
</P>
<P>
   Cadres have spent much of the summer bogged down in the ``Three
Stresses'' political campaign, which is designed to shore up an
awkward amalgam of socialist and traditional Chinese values.
</P>
<P>
   Amongst Jiang's performance repertoire is the Western church
organ. Maybe during his visit to Cambridge he will be permitted to
repeat the Chinese ``Ode to the Yellow River,'' which he bashed out
on Dutch and Finnish organs in the past, making an equally quirky
mixture of East and West. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian navy is to sell off dolphins who were
specially trained to blow up enemy ships as part of the rundown of
its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins were taught to approach a vessel from below and rub
its back, to which a mine was attached, against the keel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine that those dolphins could even distinguish
between the sound of the propellor of a foreign submarine and a
Soviet one?'' Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the
General Head Quarters of the Soviet armed forces told the
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Training of some ten dolphins started 30 years ago on the Black
Sea at a base at Balaclava near Sebastopol in the Crimea. It is not
clear how many dolphins were taught to attack enemy vessels, but
some half dozen survive today.
</P>
<P>
   They were kept in a military laboratory, but further development
of the project stopped with the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dolphins are to be sold off, under a decree signed by
Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their sale is part of a general disposal of surplus military
equipment, such as old trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers
and bulldozers, which the impoverished Russian army no longer needs
or can afford to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have only pitiful remains of what we used to have in
the Black Sea dolphinarium,'' said Baranets. ``Only five or six
dolphins survived. They tried to keep couples _ male and female.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Kozir, a correspondent of the military newspaper,
Krasnaya Zvezda, says that the Soviet plan to train dolphins to
attack ships started as a response to information that the U.S. was
investigating the use of sea animals for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Soviet and American navies were impressed with the
ability of dolphins to perform complex tricks in circuses.
</P>
<P>
   Kozir says: ``They were trained to approach the ship from below
and to rub their backs against the bottom of the ship. The mine was
on the back of the dolphin.'' He added that some dolphins were
released into the Black Sea at the time of the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The naval department of the Russian Defense Ministry said
Tuesday that it could not confirm or deny accounts of the training
of dolphins to sink enemy ships, but it was opposed to their sale.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Dygalo, the navy spokesman, said: ``I just don't know
anything about dolphins, but even if we had such dolphins how can
we sell them?''
</P>
<P>
   His reason for opposing the sale of the dolphins is rooted in
the violence of Russian business rivalries and the possible use of
dolphins as an assassination weapon against businessmen who have
bought boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine selling dolphins, which have had special
training, to a businessman who has enemies?'' asks Dygalo. ``He can
attach a bomb to a dolphin and direct him to anyone or anything he
wants to get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact the dolphins, trained for so long to carry out their
lone kamikaze missions, may have a more prosaic fate.
</P>
<P>
   Baranets says that he suspects that at the end of the day the
dolphins may not be sold to murderous businessmen but presented to
water circuses. He says: ``There is one at Sochi (on the Black Sea
coast) where you drop your wedding ring into the water and the
dolphins easily find it.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Another star, another traffic jam. They get used to
it in New York. The President is in town? Stay away from The
Waldorf. Ricky Martin is stopping in Times Square? Don't go near
the place.
</P>
<P>
   But how many New Yorkers would have thought to dodge Fifth
Avenue because of a box of bones?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a number, in fact, especially if they were Catholics. They
would not have been surprised by the circus that erupted with the
casket's arrival just after dusk at the steps of St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The weeping women, reaching out to touch. The devoted followers
gripping candles in their hands. It got so crazy, they had to close
Fifth Avenue for half an hour. That never happened to The Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest stop on the world tour not of a rock star
_ St. Patrick's, after all, is hardly Madison Square Garden _ but
of a saint, or rather the remains of a saint.
</P>
<P>
   This box was, more accurately, a reliquary of polished jacaranda
decorated with exquisite gold and silver filigree. And it contained
bones from the body of St. Therese of Lisieux, also known as the
``little flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything you will ever need to know about St. Therese is on
her website _ www.littleflower.org.
</P>
<P>
   You will see how she joined a Carmelite Convent at 16, how she
wrote a memoir, ``The Story of a Soul,'' and how, after a simple
life of devotion, she died from tuberculosis at 24 in 1897. The
book has become one of the most widely read works of Catholic
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   You will also learn about her gruelling global pilgrimage that
is already three years old. So far, St. Therese _ or at least half
her bones, the remaining half are in France _ has toured Russia,
most of western Europe, Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to hurtle across the United States and Canada,
making appearances at 114 churches and monasteries, before heading
to the Philippines in January.
</P>
<P>
   Therese of Lisieux was canonized back in 1925. It was for the
normal pre-canonization investigative process that her body was
disinterred, which has ensured the continuing availability of her
bones today.
</P>
<P>
   But her status in the Catholic firmament was boosted further in
1997, the centenary of her death, when Pope John Paul II proclaimed
her to be a Doctor of the Church. She is the youngest of 33 saints
who have the title, which denotes a special holiness. And she is
one of only three women Doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, she has pulling power. At every stop, the
crowds of faithful come to venerate her. The lucky ones get to
touch the Perspex dome that surrounds the reliquary or to press
their lips against it.
</P>
<P>
   Her draw is not hard to explain. There was the simplicity of her
life _ there were no great deeds or miracles to her name _ and she
is accessible to worshippers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not often that we get to see a saint, or at least the
relics of a saint,'' said Gerry Olsen as she stepped out from St.
Patrick's Monday. With her husband, Bill, she had come just to be
able to look at the reliquary in front of the altar. ``You feel
close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   There are the photographs of St. Therese that fellow nuns took
of her at the Lisieux Convent. The saint doing the laundry and the
saint lying in bed, stricken by the disease that killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can really feel her presence,'' said Roz Romero, a Wall
Street broker who had come to the cathedral. ``She tells us that
anybody is capable of being a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's was well prepared for the surge of visitors that
was sure to come for the 40 hours that the reliquary was to remain
within its walls.
</P>
<P>
   There is an exhibition of her pictures down one transept, with
testimonials from famous devotees of St. Therese. Among them was
Edith Piaf who was blind until three, when she was taken to visit
Lisieux. For the rest of her life she thanked St. Therese for her
sight.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the demand, services and liturgies were planned
right through until 5 a.m. when St. Therese was due to leave for
another parish in Brooklyn. At least at that hour, her departure
should cause only the minimum of traffic gridlock. &QL;

MIDWEST WHOLESOMENESS, BIG-CITY WIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, France)   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dawn Powell was admired by critics like Edmund Wilson and J.B.
Priestley, and her stories were published in The New Yorker for
years, but if it hadn't been for the continuing labors of Tim Page,
it seems likely that Dawn Powell would be entirely forgotten.
Powell, born in 1896, was a satirical novelist whose books, as she
puts it in one letter in this collection, ``may be entertaining but
the content is important comment on contemporary affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, formerly a music critic at The Washington Post and at The
New York Times, has already published a biography of Powell and
``The Diaries of Dawn Powell.'' Now, this new volume of selected
letters shows Powell at her most intimate and also at her most
charming. She had a Midwestern wholesomeness about her, and that
combined with a contrasting sensibility, a habit of Menckenesque
mockery, to create a sympathetic, winsome and yet barbed epistolary
persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen is an ugly year, isn't it?'' Powell writes to her
aunt, Orpha May Steinbrueck, in 1915 on the occasion of a birthday.
``Now 18 was a round, even, complete year. I felt young and
debutantish. But 19! It's just a sort of gathering up of all the
tag ends of all the teens _ a Review of Reviews _ nothing new or
thrilling about 19.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of that letter Powell was a student at Lake Erie
College in Painesville, Ohio, from which place she would soon move
permanently to New York to begin her literary career. Her early
life had not been a portrait of Middle American bliss. Her mother
died when she was 7, and when her father remarried, her stepmother
was, Page says, abusive, and Dawn escaped to her aunt, who reared
her.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest elements of these letters, especially the
early ones, is their steadily cheery tone, the absence of
references to domestic travails. The teen-age Dawn wrote to her
aunt most often and to various other relatives and to school
friends, but there are no letters to her father. That may be
because no such letters have survived; still, it is clear that Dawn
was a kind of orphan, and she was to forge her life and her
relationships outside of any standard sort of family.
</P>
<P>
   She went to New York in 1918 and began writing stories. She
married Joseph Gousha, a poet and music critic who later became an
advertising man, and she had a son, Jojo, who was mentally impaired
and spent much of his life in institutions. The couple moved to
Greenwich Village, and their marriage, while it lasted, was
punctuated by separations and affairs.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of their first separation, Powell wrote
poignantly self-incriminating letters to Gousha cajoling him into
taking her back. ``Alone out here, I think of all the ways I have
failed you,'' she wrote from Long Island in 1928. ``It seems to me
I controlled my life until I got too happy _ you arranged that _
and then I just took a flying leap into the air and stayed there
while you waded through the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell began publishing novels that satirized Ohio life and
later the New York social scene. She gained critical but not
commercial success, and she was accepted into the highbrow literary
world. By the time she was 30 or so, her correspondence evolved
into a witty running commentary on the republic of letters. She
communicated with Edmund Wilson, whom she called Wig, with the
novelist John Dos Passos (Dos) and with her editor at Scribner's,
the legendary Maxwell Perkins (Max). In these letters, Powell is at
her most exuberantly appealing. She writes to Dos Passos about a
Writers' Congress she attended in 1937 at which Ernest Hemingway
spoke:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest gave a good speech if that's what you like and his sum
total was that war was pretty nice and a lot better than sitting
around a hot hall and writers ought to all go to war and get killed
and if they didn't they were a big sissy. Then he went to the Stork
Club, followed by a pack of foxes.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later Dos Passos and his wife, Katy Smith Dos Passos,
were in an automobile accident in which Katy was killed and Dos
Passos lost an eye. Powell wrote to him: ``I am thinking of you all
the time, and I find two things to be glad about. One, that you are
a writer so that agony is of service to you, cruel as our work is _
and another, that you have physical pain to dull the unbearable
other kind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Powell lived in Paris for a couple of years,
and she assumed an attitude of gentle agnosticism toward the idols
of French literature. She writes to Wig about the annoyed departure
of a friend during cocktails at the Deux Magots: ``The reason he
left was my remark that Sartre was the Hopalong Cassidy of France,
and he said I should be more humble before French letters. ... I
returned that this view was not _ as he held _ the stupid view of
America toward France, but my own and based not on my brief but not
brief enough stay in Paris but on Sartre as a commercial enterprise
like cornflakes or Shirley Temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is notably absent from these letters. Powell lived through
the two world wars but says hardly a word about them. She has
terrible difficulties with her son but she rarely mentions that to
her friends, only to her husband and doctor. As she gets older, she
has health problems, which she writes about to Gousha, still her
husband, and to others. A certain elan seems missing as the letters
take on a sardonic and sometimes elegiac quality. She writes in
1963 to Edmund Wilson of Nabokov: ``His book on Gogol _ my earliest
literary idol _ infuriated me and I threw it across the room after
he had wallowed in the grisly ugliness of poor Gogol and jumped up
and down over him, then patted him to show Daddy alone loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   She talks of stomach pains in that same letter; clearly she is
reflecting on her mortality (she died of cancer two years later),
but she never loses her sense of humor. ``Words do not bring
happiness nor grammar good a poem,'' she tells Wilson. She
identifies this line as an ``Old Persian saying by Omar the shish
kebab maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is really Powell herself speaking at the end of a
life that brought many events but less fame and, it would seem,
less happiness than she deserved.

`CRAZY IN ALABAMA' IS FUNNY, ECCENTRIC, JUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's said an outsider can sometimes see things that those of us
on the inside miss because we haven't the distance or objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Banderas can hardly be called a stranger in Hollywood
these days _ he's embraced American culture, married actress
Melanie Griffith and starred in a slew of box office hits like
``The Mask of Zorro'' and ``Desperado.'' It seems like a long time
ago that we thought of him as that sizzling senor in Pedro
Almodovar's ``Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down,'' for which the actor won the
equivalent of the Oscar in his native Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But he brings a fresh perspective to his directorial debut,
``Crazy In Alabama,'' a quintessentially ``American'' movie that
captures the elusive essence of life in that loss-of-innocence time
_ the 1960s. Adapted from Mark Childress' 1994 novel about a boy's
coming of age in the turbulent, volatile Civil Rights-era South,
the film is rife with the sudden, harsh truths about the real world
that emerges with adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Crazy in Alabama'' is also funny, eccentric and touchingly
just, combining a unique interpretation of the time with an offbeat
sense of humor. And Banderas has created a visual style that would
make Almodovar proud.
</P>
<P>
   The film is surprisingly potent, refusing to shy away from the
horrors of racial strife and segregated life in the dim little
backwoods town of Industry, Ala., where 12-year-old Peejoe (Lucas
Black) and his brother are shifted from relative to relative after
their parents die. The boys wind up with their Uncle Dove (David
Morse), the town undertaker, who has just learned that his sister,
Lucille (Melanie Griffith), has finally killed her abusive husband
and taken off for Hollywood with his decapitated head.
</P>
<P>
   The racist Sheriff Doggett (Meat Loaf Aday) is determined to
bring her back while he secretly eludes justice for his treatment
of the town's black citizens. Doggett isn't above murder to keep
Industry from ``turning into Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   These two stories entwine deftly, cutting back and forth between
very different fights for freedom. ``Aunt Lucille's life was one
long dream at the movies with her in all the lead parts,'' says
Peejoe and, indeed, ``Crazy In Alabama'' combines the outsider's
idea of the American dream of sudden fame and fortune with the
ability to view internal strife from that same fresh point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas revitalizes the tired Southern gothic genre that has
turned into hothouse melodrama in Hollywood's interpretations of
the works of writers Flannery O'Connor, Truman Capote, Tennessee
Williams and Carson McCullers.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy In Alabama. Directed by Antonio Banderas. Written by Mark
Childress. Cast: Melanie Griffith, David Morse, Lucas Black, Cathy
Moriarty. Columbia Pictures. 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.

ELIZABETH DOLE GIVES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throughout her long, successful public career,
Elizabeth Dole has been proof positive that it's not true nice
girls finish last.
</P>
<P>
   But the presidency has always been a prize reserved for tough
guys, and Dole was not one of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Her abrupt withdrawal from the contest for the Republican
presidential nomination does not mean that the country is not yet
ready for a female president. Some other woman might have run a
better race, and someday some other woman will.
</P>
<P>
   But the very qualities that have made Dole popular with men as
well as women _ a professional seriousness cloaked in ladylike
softness _ worked against her as a presidential candidate. It was
hard to envision her as commander-in-chief, no matter how hawkish
she sounded on national defense.
</P>
<P>
   She is, alas, far too feminine for the White House. This is not
in any way to denigrate her intelligence or her leadership ability.
She is a woman of formidable ability, as she demonstrated in two
Cabinet posts and as head of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   But she has an image problem. She just didn't look the part.
It's not fair, but there it is. Dole couldn't make it because she
is too sugary.
</P>
<P>
   A less cozy, more reckless female will someday break the gender
barrier. It will be someone like Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane
Kirkpatrick or California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, all of whom can
talk tough with the boys and get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Dole made her way in a man's world by being
non-threatening. She was never a leader in the women's rights
movement. She seemed, in fact, uncomfortable with the notion that
her audiences were mostly female and unsure how to capitalize on
that.
</P>
<P>
   Southern women of her era and proper upbringing got ahead with
charm and cunning. They simply did not get in the face of the male
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   She launched her campaign with a bold statement in New Hampshire
supporting limited gun control measures, signifying a dramatic
departure from her bland history of political caution and
orthodoxy. But the message got at best mixed reviews, powerful GOP
voices were raised in anger, and she quickly retreated into muddy
positions that left her without an identity beyond her gender.
</P>
<P>
   She advertised as a centrist, but her long years as a
tongue-tied candidate's wife were too much to overcome. She was so
mushy she proffered little red meat with which to arouse fans and
raise campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Her inability to raise money was the specific reason she gave
for quitting before a single vote was cast. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and billionaire publisher Steve Forbes have 80 times more
money in their campaign treasuries than she had in hers.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a symptom, not the cause, of a weak candidacy. Dole
was so carefully packaged and scripted that she was unable to
connect with Republican voters. If she had a spontaneous moment on
the campaign trail, nobody knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   And her No. 2 position in the polls had begun to slip in some
places behind that of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has a
commanding presence and now stands to pick up some of her
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the awkwardness about Bob Dole. What to do with a
husband whose fame and political credentials were greater than hers
but couldn't keep his mouth shut?
</P>
<P>
   As the most recent GOP presidential nominee, Bob Dole could not
be hidden. But his wisecracks were not helpful to her candidacy. He
sometimes upstaged her with his own policy opinions, and his
presence didn't bring in the campaign money she needed.
</P>
<P>
   There was immediate speculation that she would make a nifty
running mate for Bush, but this idea does not seem likely to
survive the Republican National Convention next summer. It is not
clear what she would bring to the ticket. Her appeal to women was
overrated, and she has no regional or ideological constituency.
She'll make a great CEO for some big corporation.

RUTHLESS IN A GREEDY WORLD. SOUNDS FAMILIAR DOESN'T IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Becky Sharp meets Jos Sedley, the brother of her best
friend, Amelia, she sees what we do: a pudgy, pompous little man,
bound to be fonder of wine and food than he ever will be of a wife.
``He's very handsome,'' the calculating Becky confides to Amelia,
in what is just the beginning of the social hypocrisy that is the
world of ``Vanity Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Becky of course is one of the world's great antiheroines, and
``Vanity Fair'' one of its most amusing, acerbic novels. A&AMP;E's
version is a pretty, diverting spectacle, but disappointing in its
lack of bite.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing is Thackeray's voice, that droll commentary that
turns the exploits of a ruthless, ambitious orphan into a panorama
of early 19th-century society. Thackeray writes of Becky, ``All the
world used her ill said this young misanthropist ... and we may be
sure that the persons of either sex whom all the world treats ill,
deserve entirely the treatment they get.''
</P>
<P>
   There may have been no way to translate such a wry narrative to
the screen. The problem is that nothing else fills the void here:
not the inner lives of characters, not enough suspense or dynamism
to sustain the six hours of this perfectly pleasant but bland
mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Little is a smooth and appealing Becky, with her
open-faced smile and guileless manner. We might almost believe her
ourselves if we didn't see her, early on, pilfering jewelry from
Amelia before setting off for a dreaded life as a governess.
</P>
<P>
   As she courses up and down the social ladder, Becky encounters a
wealth of people Thackeray deliberately set up as caricatures.
George Osborne, a dashing cad in his red military coat, leaves
Amelia a widow, unaware that he would have abandoned her for Becky
in a second. His best friend is the steadfast William Dobbin, whose
love for Amelia is obvious to everyone except her. And there is the
sweet-natured Amelia herself, selfless and good to the point of
idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   The actors embody these types perfectly, especially David
Bradley as the man who employs Becky as a governess: the
wonderfully named Sir Pitt Crawley, slimy and drooling enough to
make anyone's skin crawl. Miriam Margolyes is his wealthy, obese
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a great beauty myself once,'' she announces ludicrously,
explaining her affection for Becky. Sir Pitt's older son, also
named Pitt, is played by Anton Lesser as an amiable fussbudget,
touchingly susceptible to the slightest flattery.
</P>
<P>
   The penniless younger son, Rawdon, elopes with Becky, and they
set off on a life of living by her wits and his gambling. More than
anyone else in the series, Nathaniel Parker brings some complexity
to his character. Rawdon tacitly approves Becky's flirtations with
wealthy men, seeing only what he chooses to; he feels sorry for
their neglected son, but is too weak willed to do anything about
Becky's harsh treatment of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Marc Munden, exploits the cinematic qualities of
``Vanity Fair,'' as an active camera searches out the small touches
that create a rich texture, from Becky's lustrous hair to Dobbin's
lovesick gaze. At times the visual limitations become conspicuous,
though.
</P>
<P>
   During the Battle of Waterloo, in which both Osborne and Dobbin
fight bravely, the quick-cutting action focuses on these familiar
characters. The intimacy can't quite hide the fact that this should
have been an epic scene.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Little makes every one of Becky's situations believable.
Except for the blinkered Amelia, women see through her, while men
are snowed by her. (Some of Thackeray's types are vital even
today.) When Becky flirts with her rich brother-in-law, his wife
delicately asks, ``Pitt, my dear, you don't think that Mrs. Crawley
might have been flattering you for her own ends?'' But believing in
the pretty shallowness of Becky's character is finally no
substitute for being engaged by her story.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Davies, who wrote the screenplay, also did the dazzling
television adaptations of ``Pride and Prejudice,'' ``Moll
Flanders'' and ``Emma.'' With ``Vanity Fair,'' he came upon a
chestnut he couldn't crack. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANY DAY NOW
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime, Sunday night at 8 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flat-footed and preachy as drama, the Lifetime series ``Any Day
Now'' has nonetheless been praised for its well-meaning subject:
two women in Alabama, one white and one black, who have been
lifelong best friends. In Sunday's two-hour special, the white
friend, Mary Elizabeth (Annie Potts), mistakes a black law student
for a waitress; the black friend, Rene (Lorraine Toussaint),
accuses her of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The story is more compelling than usual, as Mary Elizabeth
researches her family's racist past, including an uncle who is a Ku
Klux Klan member. But the special also reveals what is typically
best and worst about the series. Its strongest scenes are often the
flashbacks to the 1960s, when the innocent girls were learning
about color from their parents and society.
</P>
<P>
   The weakest element is the show's tendency to deliver canned
speeches about race. Ms. Potts sputters through them; Ms. Toussaint
brings a more natural delivery to hers. As Sunday's show proves,
``Any Day Now'' recognizes the subtle way that racism continues to
invade even the most open minds, black and white. And as the series
proves, good intentions do not automatically make for good drama.
</P>
<P>
   The show will be followed at 10 by a town hall meeting produced
by ABC News with Cokie Roberts and Deborah Roberts as anchors. That
program, not yet taped, has a noble but cliched title that sounds
like a real-life version of ``Any Day Now'': ``I'm Not a Racist but
... Small Steps Toward Healing the Hate.''

BEADS CONVEY SENSE OF HISTORY ACROSS THE AGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diamonds may be a girl's best friend, but beads are for
everybody. Their appeal is ancient, universal and primal.
</P>
<P>
   This much is evident in ``A Beaded Universe: Strands of
Culture,'' an exhibition that opened Thursday at the American Craft
Museum in New York. The show begins with a time line illustrating
that beads go back 40,000 years; then it documents this history
with displays of exceptional pieces on three floors.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate beadwork and garments from every continent fill the
galleries. From the Yoruba culture in Nigeria there is a
magnificent eight-foot-wide priest's robe decorated with beads;
from South Africa there is a colorful Ndebele beaded wedding
costume and a Zulu apron with rows of memory beads. From Asia come
a pair of Indonesian wooden baby carriers covered in cowrie shells
and a Tibetan turquoise and coral neck collar.
</P>
<P>
   Some European beadwork will be less familiar. One of the
flashiest pieces is a Czech wedding bonnet with beads, sparkles and
sequins that were meant to keep away evil spirits. There are also
European purses that were beaded with motifs from Oriental carpets.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan there is a large collection of carved beads called
ojime, which were used to fasten the thongs on small bags. They are
made in the shapes of animals, monsters, even babies, in carved
coral, ivory and bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   North America is represented by a Navajo deerskin dress with
beaded tassels that comes from the Plains and a 1920s beaded
flapper dress that represents urban life at its most sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The beadwork objects are on loan from the Bead Museum of
Glendale, Ariz., several private collectors and the Mingei
International Museum in San Diego, where this exhibition began.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous fascination with beads, said Martha
Longenecker, the Mingei curator who organized the show. ``They are
tactile and warm. They endure. They are the ultimate recyclable
material; they get combined and recombined, like DNA. Beads are the
smallest portable object.''
</P>
<P>
   Beads can be made of any material: bone, wood, shell, amber,
turquoise, coral, pearl and metal. As Holly Hotchner, the director
of the Craft Museum, put it: ``A bead is anything with a hole in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mingei/Craft Museum show came about as a result of Ms.
Longenecker's reading of Lois Sherr Dubin's comprehensive book,
``The History of Beads: From 30,000 BC to the Present'' (Harry N.
Abrams, 1987). Ms. Dubin, who is a landscape architect, said in an
interview that she became fascinated with beads as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am attracted to is the power of a rounded, shiny form
that you can wear and it makes you feel good,'' she said. ``The
connection is primal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin began collecting beads when her work as a landscape
architect began to take her all over the world _ and she has never
stopped. ``For me, having quality, craftsmanship and design all in
one thing you can wear _ a string of beads _ is as good as it
gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin spent more than a decade researching and writing her
book, which has now been published in an abridged form. She said
that Abrams has sold more than 100,000 copies of the original work.
</P>
<P>
   Beads have always served many purposes beyond just decorating
their wearer. ``In ancient Asia, beads were scattered like seed
beneath temples, to induce bountiful harvests,'' Ms. Dubin said. In
the book she explained that beads were worn to commemorate status,
bind marriages, and protect the wearer against malevolence; they
were also a medium of exchange or barter. ``They've probably been
made and used by every culture in the world,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Over the millennia beads have tended to follow routes of trade
and conquest. Ms. Dubin tracked turquoise, agate and coral in the
Near East in 6500 BC, and lapis lazuli in Sumeria in the fourth
millennium. The Egyptians, famously accomplished jewelers, made
beads of amethyst, gold, carnelian and lapis. They in turn inspired
the Romans, who manufactured and traded glass beads on a global
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin was imaginative in her research. When she wanted to
find examples of how the Byzantines wore their beads in the sixth
century, she studied the mosaics in the Church of San Vitale in
Ravenna, Italy. The mosaic walls there, from 547, boast full-length
portraits of Emperor Justinian and his wife, Empress Theodora. The
empress is wearing pearls, emeralds and sapphires in her tiara,
collar, necklace and earrings. Since the only Byzantines permitted
to don jewels were members of the Imperial Court, the Ravenna
mosaics are like a snapshot of the splendor of imperial authority.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin also devoted chapters to tracing the trade routes of
Venetian glass beads, which made their way to Asia, India, the
American colonies and Africa _ where they were traded for 1,000
percent of their value. Each culture adopted the beads but used
them in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, when many Europeans considered wearing
jewelry to be pagan, rosaries were embraced. ``Healing powers have
been attributed to rosaries, as well as power to exorcise evil
spirits and ward off lightning,'' Ms. Dubin wrote. (She noted that
the Anglo-Saxon word bede means prayer.)
</P>
<P>
   Rosaries, of course, have been adopted by several religions:
Roman Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Buddhists, who
carved the wood of the fig tree to make prayer beads as early as
500 BC, employ 108 beads. Muslims use 99; Catholics, 150.
</P>
<P>
   In Tibet, Buddhist prayer beads called mala are made with disks
taken from the bones of a lama, or holy man. Ms. Dubin wrote that
the choice of human bone may be meant to impress upon the devotee
the transient nature of existence.
</P>
<P>
   This account notwithstanding, the historical section of the show
is cheerful and upbeat: a true reminder that beads do endure and
continue to change.
</P>
<P>
   David McFadden, senior curator of the Craft Museum, has
organized ``Beadz,'' a companion show at the museum, with 60
contemporary pieces of beaded artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beads have come out of the handicraft closet,'' McFadden said,
``and it's the artists who are doing it. They like the idea of
complexity. Recent art has been so uninvolved with technique that
there's now a return to craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the beadwork in the show is meant to be worn. John
Eric Riis of Atlanta created a sculpture called ``Hands of the
Oracle,'' which is a gloved hand sheathed in hand-sewn pearls and
beads depicting the evil eye. Jan Yager made a bib called ``City
Flotsam.'' It is fashioned of crack vials that Ms. Yager picked up
on the streets of Los Angeles and turned into beads.
</P>
<P>
   Such works of art belong in a craft museum, Ms. Hotchner said.
``Our mission is to expand the definition of craft.'' &QL;

SPOTLIGHT ON A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE TIGER LILLIES: ``Shockheaded Peter: A Junk Opera'' (NVC
Arts/Atlantic).
</P>
<P>
   Parents flustered by the horrors of the video arcade should
examine the classics of kiddie literature. Children's tales have
long incarnated the dark corners of the littlest psyches, from
Grimm's dark forest to Roald Dahl's rotting giant peach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shockheaded Peter,'' the English ``junk opera'' at the New
Victory Theater in Manhattan, is a delicious reminder of kiddie
culture's gory heart. It respectfully, and therefore audaciously,
reworks ``Struwwelpeter,'' a parody of children's cautionary tales,
by the Victorian psychiatrist Heinrich Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   In those  mischievous children meet outrageously cruel
fates. The id-stimulating mayhem reminds us that moral rectitude
can be a vengeful, life-squashing force.
</P>
<P>
   The lurid circus sideshow atmosphere of ``Shockheaded Peter'' is
effectively mirrored in its music, written and performed by the
Tiger Lillies. That trio of accordion, stand-up bass and portable
drum kit is led by Martin Jacques, a born carny with a
hermaphroditic castrato voice and a penchant for lurching rhythms
and creaky melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Songs like ``Snip Snip (Suck a Thumb)'' and ``Fidgety Phil''
hardly seem contemporary, except in their atmospherically rich
production and their obvious debt to Tom Waits. Jacques' piping
voice can be hard to decipher in person, and this recording makes
it possible to catch every creepy detail of his songs.
</P>
<P>
   It well captures the show's naughty mood. It also stands as a
resurrected classic for children, and grown-ups, with open minds
and stout stomachs.

ADVICE FROM SOME GOOD SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tonya Harding is back in figure skating, which
can only mean that fresh starts are now available to all miscreant
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see: Pete Rose as manager of the first baseball franchise
that moves to Las Vegas, Ryan Leaf as chief executive officer for
the Esalen Institute and Denny McLain as Bill Bradley's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   In the next millennium, with a clean slate, Marge Schott will
sit on the board of the Rainbow Coalition, Larry Johnson will
become a guest lecturer in world history at Columbia (expounding on
his dissertation: ``Human Bondage on $25,000 a Day``), and Darryl
Strawberry will inherit Ann Landers' column.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, they may all have their own advice columns or talk
shows. So to prepare them for their second chances in life (or
ninth or 12th, but, hey, who's counting?), Ms. Demeanor is turning
her mail bag over to a group of sports figures who have overcome
their own crimes, misdemeanors, hubris and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   They have so much to offer the next generation _ gentle
guidance, extensive experience with the phrase, ``I've put that all
behind me,'' and Robert Shapiro's cell-phone number.
</P>
<P>
   So, without further ado, let's turn this show over to the guest
hosts:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: I paid about $10 for almost $400 worth of
merchandise, because a friend of mine worked behind the store
counter, and now I may have to go to jail, plus lose most of my
senior season of college football. I was supposed to be a Heisman
Trophy winner. Please help me get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pete, Tallahassee
</P>
<P>
   Dear Pete, from guest adviser Phil Knight: Let me come and act
as a character witness for you, kid. We can tell prosecutors that
you are a student of Nike economic principles, which state that $40
a month is a generous salary.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't get you off the hook, we'll point out that my
company hands out free merchandise to youngsters who show up as
larger-than-average blobs on a sonogram. As a premier athlete, you
have virtually no experience at paying for your own clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as soon as you go pro, you can expect to be paid for
getting dressed, for keeping careful track of which baseball cap to
wear on the sidelines during each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the authorities hear my explanation of the rigorous
entitlement training you've undergone since fifth grade, they'll be
amazed that you came up with the $10.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: We threw a few batteries at a greedy little
punk last summer, and we booed an obnoxious Dallas Cowboy while he
was lying immobile on the field, wondering whether his spine was
intact. For this, we've been condemned as despicable, tacky brutes.
How can we overcome this unfortunate stereotyping?
</P>
<P>
   _ Fans, Philadelphia &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Fans, from co-guest advisers J.D. Drew and Michael Irvin:
We'd like to offer you two things. First, our empathy. Nobody
understands better than we how the news media latch on to a few bad
episodes and label a person forever. A shameless contract holdout,
a cocaine bust, a few graceless end-zone celebrations _ they'll
never let you hear the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we extend our gratitude. We've had a hard time
transforming ourselves into sympathetic figures. You've done more
to help our images than you can ever imagine, or care to know.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: See above letter from Philadelphia.
Substitute trash for batteries, and incompetent umpires for greedy
little punk, and you'll have a rough idea of our problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fans, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Fans, from guest adviser Tim Tschida, second-base umpire in
Game 4 of the ALCS: All I can say is: Ditto to Part II of the reply
above. If you hadn't distracted attention from my blundering at
second base, I might be under investigation for trying to fix the
game. Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what Sandy Alderson, the umpires' nemesis, would have
done to me if you folks hadn't started throwing trash to protest my
work? He had to focus on keeping the peace instead, and that meant
he had to be diplomatic with the umps. Do you know how hard it is
to make Sandy Alderson act like a diplomat? Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Demeanor: Is it possible to make people forget that you
bit off part of an opponent's ear and did time for rape?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike, in Perpetual Purgatory
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mike, from special guest adviser Tonya Harding: Anything is
possible, big guy. Of course, it helps to be a little blonde that a
lot of men want to, uh ... forgive. Tell people you went into
therapy and learned tons about yourself. Speak in a saccharine
voice, the kind that Miss Texas always uses when she says her
favorite colors are red, white and blue. You've spent time around
beauty pageants. You should be able to handle this.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, sweet-talk the news media. They'll bash you as much
as anyone, but they're easy to con. Just remember that all we need
to be considered redeemed, wonderful people are: a good left hook
or a working double axel, plus a willingness to grant one-on-one
interviews. And if at first you don't succeed, just tell the judges
that your shoelaces broke.

RE-VULCANIZED: LEONARD NIMOY'S SPOCK DOUBLE FEATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Leonard
Nimoy in a scene from ``Star Trek.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You just can't keep a good Vulcan down.
 &HT;    ``Spock always seems to come back,'' Leonard Nimoy says,
laughing raucously. ``And you thought Bill Clinton was the comeback
kid.''
 &HT;    Trekkers who figured they'd seen the last of their green-blooded
hero are in for a treat, as Spock returns in material both fresh
and old.
 &HT;    On the fresh front, there's ``Spock Vs. Q,'' the long-awaited
Simon &AMP; Schuster audionovel version of an encounter between
``Trek's'' beacon of logic and its most impish alien raconteur,
played by John de Lancie, Nimoy's Alien Voices partner.
 &HT;    ``It's chaos vs. logic,'' Nimoy says by telephone from his Los
Angeles office. ``It just lends itself to that kind of wordplay. We
had a great time, John and I, and we had a conversation just this
morning about doing a sequel.
 &HT;    ``Radio-style acting gives you an opportunity to use acting
techniques that we don't get to use very often,'' he adds. ``We can
play multiple characters, create sounds, shift voices and also
change age, personality and ethnicity without heavy makeup or
disguises.
 &HT;    ``It's a very flexible form.''
 &HT;    Turning to the Spock of old, the pointy-eared one is all but
omnipresent on Paramount Home Video's DVD editions of the original
series. Volume IV, for example, features ``Charlie X'' and
``Balance of Terror,'' as well as their respective
original-broadcast preview trailers.
 &HT;    ``It's all back to the original quality and intent,'' Nimoy
says. ``It's really very, very good. They're digitized prints done
from the original negatives.''
 &HT;    Even when ``Trek'' kicked off nearly 34 years ago, Nimoy
acknowledges, nobody considered the show exactly a state-of-the-art
enterprise
 &HT;    ``The technology was pretty good, but I don't remember thinking
it was extraordinary,'' he says. ``What was special about the show
was the writing, the context, the subject matter, and not so much
the execution.
 &HT;    ```2001: A Space Odyssey' had extraordinary technology for its
time,'' Nimoy adds. ``We had to make a show on a weekly basis and
on a limited budget. Everybody knows that our sets looked like
cardboard.
 &HT;    ``If we did `Star Trek' today,'' he says, ``we'd have to have
today's technology. The audience's tastes have changed, and so have
their expectations. I don't think you could get away with not
having everything be state-of-the-art.
 &HT;    ``I'm not sure, though, even if everything were
state-of-the-art, that it would make any difference in the
watchability of the show or its impact.''
 &HT;    Beyond ``Star Trek'' tie-ins, Nimoy remains a busy man. He can
be heard on several television commercials, helped create an
educational pilot program designed to enable high-school students
to stage their own Alien Voices-style productions, is providing a
voice for Disney's upcoming animated feature ``Atlantis'' and has
displayed his photography at galleries in New York and Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Nimoy says he doesn't care to run himself ragged
any more. He's 68 now, has money in the bank and a wife and
grandkids whose company he wishes to enjoy as often as possible.
 &HT;    That attitude was reinforced for Nimoy this past summer, when
his dear friend and ``Trek'' co-star DeForest Kelley passed away at
age 79.
 &HT;    ``I still remember vividly the days when we were making the
original series and there would be squabbles between Bill Shatner
and I,'' Nimoy says softly. ``We were like two hotheaded young
brothers who were very caring about each other and very
competitive. De would very calmly be in the middle and listen to
both sides, and he gave us a chance to air out our arguments.
 &HT;    ``He was a very stabilizing force on the show,'' the actor says.
``De was great. He was a wonderful person.''
 &HT;    And Nimoy understands the impact of Kelley's death on ``Star
Trek'' and all who love it.
 &HT;    ``It means we're all mortal,'' he says.

   DELTA-BOSTON _ Delta Air Lines is in talks to build a new $400
million terminal at Boston's Logan Airport, where it wants to
consolidate its domestic operations and also establish direct
flights to Europe. Boston would become Delta's fourth
trans-Atlantic gateway, along with Atlanta, New York and
Cincinnati. Details of the plan may be disclosed at Delta's annual
meeting next week in Boston, but negotiations may not be moving

   CIGARS _ The cigar craze has burned itself out. Due to glossy
magazines like ``Cigar Connoisseur,'' which featured hot Hollywood
stars like Demi Moore and Sylvester Stallone smoking stogies,
cigars had enjoyed a trendy revival. But for 1999, analysts predict
a 10 percent fall in sales of premium cigars. Three cigar companies
_ JR Cigar Inc.; General Cigar Holdings and Dimon Inc., showed
quarterly revenues down significantly from the same period in 1998.
Holt's, another cigar company, saw its stock downgraded by
Prudential Bache. (Poe, Austin American-Statesman).

   BBN-ROCKER _ ATLANTA _ Braves reliever John Rocker has become
talk of baseball in the postseason. His comments about some New
York Mets fans drew national media attention in the NLCS and his
automobile accident Tuesday also kept him in the news. Despite his
off-the-field antics, Rocker has been the team's most successful
reliever on the field. His trademark sprint from the bullpen has
often led to overpowering performances on the mound, as witnessed
by two saves against the Mets. But who is the real John Rocker and
what makes him tick? (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-RIVERA _ He's not as vocal as Braves reliever John Rocker,
but Yankee closer Mariano Rivera has been more dominating in the
postseason. Rivera hasn't allowed an earned run in five postseason
games this season and has the lowest ERA (0.70) in postseason
history. On a roster filled with All-Star pitchers, Rivera might be
the most valuable Yankee heading into the World Series. (Stinson,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. _ At Claiborne &AMP; Churchill Vintners, in
a building made of straw, Clay Thompson's left hand was stained
dark red as he greeted visitors recently. He'd been ``punching down
the cap'' on a batch of syrah grapes in the back of the room, and
the crushing tool _ a stainless steel foot on the end of a long
pole _ tends to get a bit messy.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, at the Laverne winery _ a small warehouse in a
commercial area _ Pete Cron was busy testing the properties of some
wine grapes he'd just purchased, and deftly wielded beakers, eye
droppers and other items. He did all of this one-handed, because it
was his turn to watch his 20-month-old daughter, Mary, who wriggled
in the crook of his left arm as he worked.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been put off by the corporate feel of such
well-established wine regions as the Napa Valley, there's an
emerging sliver of wine country along California's Central Coast
that might be for you. It's the Edna Valley, which stretches south
of San Luis Obispo. It's decidedly mom-and-pop _ literally, in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The area, about 200 miles north of Los Angeles, didn't see its
first planting of commercial grapes until the early 1970s, but in
recent years it has experienced exponential growth, joining wine
regions throughout the state that are scurrying to quench
suburbia's seemingly boundless thirst for fine varietal wine.
</P>
<P>
   This area _ which is generally grouped with adjacent Arroyo
Grande Valley and nearby Saucelito Canyon _ is no more than a dozen
miles long and perhaps four miles wide, but it is now home to 2,100
acres of vineyards and 21 wine labels, eight of which maintain
tasting rooms (six others operate by appointment only). Its grapes
have been snapped up by such major wine players as Robert Mondavi,
Au Bon Climat and Kendall-Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Even for travelers who aren't wine drinkers, it is probably
worth a detour just for the scenery. Highway 227 curls east and
then north from U.S. 101, winding through rolling hills of
vineyards and grassy slopes dotted with ancient, gnarled oaks. Low
coastal mountains rim the scene at one edge and morning fog from
Pismo Beach creeps in from the other.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes _ notably chardonnay and pinot noir _ positively love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is unique geography along this part of the coast _ and
this also includes Santa Ynez and Santa Maria,'' said Phillip Doub,
an agribusiness professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo who
coordinates the school's 6-month-old minor course of study in wine
and viticulture. ``There are east-west valleys with no ridges
between the ocean and where the grapes are grown. Napa, Sonoma,
other valleys run north-south. They don't have a window to the
ocean ... That window allows cooling and a longer growing season.''
</P>
<P>
   Grapes that do better without the chill _ cabernet sauvignon,
merlot, zinfandel _ don't fare particularly well here, but the
market for pinot noir and chardonnay doesn't show any signs of
slackening, and this region is doing its part to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Agricultural Statistics Service, San
Luis Obispo County had 6,456 acres planted in vineyards 10 years
ago. By last year, that figure had jumped to 14,847 _ more than
double in less than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every damn fool wants to start a winery,'' said Thompson.
``Every ex-professor, or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were delivered with tongue firmly in cheek. Thompson
is an ex-professor, an accomplished one. He holds a doctorate in
Scandinavian studies from Harvard and is conversant in five
languages. But his teaching job at the University of Michigan was
wearing on him as he reached age 40 in 1981, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a vacation trip to the Central Coast, he and his wife,
Fredericka, visited Edna Valley Vineyard. They didn't want to
leave. And didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson resigned his position and got a job as a cellar worker
at the winery, then began asking a lot of questions. Just two years
later, the Claiborne &AMP; Churchill label was launched (the name
combines his first name and her maiden name). The winery is now
housed in a post-and-beam structure with walls of rice-straw bales
on Carpenter Canyon Road.
</P>
<P>
   The husband-wife team produces just under 5,000 cases a year,
and visitors to the tasting room are advised to keep an open mind.
These winemakers take white varietals that are customarily produced
as sweet wines _ gewurztraminer, muscat, riesling _ and tweak the
process to create drier wines from them.
</P>
<P>
   European visitors to the winery are often startled when the
disheveled, grape-stained American behind the counter begins
speaking to them in their native tongue _ especially if they've
just been talking to each other about him in German, Swedish,
Norwegian, French or Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt career change was the result of ``burning out on
teaching and the politics of university life,'' Thompson said. ``I
jokingly say I started my own business so I wouldn't have to go to
any more committee meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like this one abound in this burgeoning wine region.
</P>
<P>
   Laverne Vineyards is owned by brothers Don and Pete Cron,
refugees from the Los Angeles area. Pete came to the area in the
late 1970s to study crop science at Cal Poly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be a farmer, I just didn't know what,'' he
said. ``Then I worked for a winery.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers own 2 1/2 acres near Atascadero, planted in
cabernet sauvignon grapes. They buy the rest from local vineyards,
and produce their modest output _ 1,200 cases annually _ out of
rented warehouse space in San Luis Obispo's southern commercial
district.
</P>
<P>
   A price list on the wall advises that Laverne's '97 Estate
Cabernet Sauvignon, priced at $32 a bottle, is limited to two per
customer. ``We only make 40 cases,'' Pete Cron said. ``Most of that
goes to the family or the guy who prints our labels for us (in
exchange for wine).''
</P>
<P>
   Another winery, Seven Peaks, uses as its tasting room a former
one-room schoolhouse, built in 1908. As you sample the wines, you
look out across the valley through the rippled, antique glass of
the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the wineries in the Edna Valley are quaint and
unassuming.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Valley Vineyard, the senior player in the region, bottles
100,000 cases a year, 90 percent of it chardonnay. It maintains a
big, modern tasting room, gift shop and patio picnic area on a hill
in the heart of the valley. The view to the north out the picture
windows of the tasting room takes in the infinite rows of the Niven
family's Paragon Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Nivens got all of this started. After operating a successful
grocery chain in the San Francisco area, they planted the valley's
first commercial grapes in the early 1970s. Today the family farms
700 acres and co-owns Edna Valley Vineyard, which it founded.
</P>
<P>
   Another winery worth a visit is Talley Vineyards, which lies in
the south end of the region in the Arroyo Grande Valley. After Au
Bon Climat of the Santa Ynez Valley had success with Talley grapes,
the vineyard began making exceptional wines of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Spectator magazine gave Talley's 1996 Chardonnay Arroyo
Grande Valley a rating of 90 (on a scale of 100). Another
exceptional wine encountered on a recent visit was Talley's 1997
Pinot Noir Arroyo Grande Valley ($28 at the winery).
</P>
<P>
   For devotees of sparkling wine, there is Laetitia Estate Wines
(formerly Maison Deutz), just south of Arroyo Grande on U.S. 101.
It concentrates on the wines that do well here _ pinot noir,
chardonnay, pinot blanc. But it also uses the same grapes to make
sparkling wines _ 5 to 10 percent of its production, according to
Tim Deller, who conducts tours of the grounds by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The sparkling wines were found to be sensational, particularly
the 1992 Elegance Reserve ($23), made primarily from chardonnay
grapes and so delightfully dry it seems to dissolve on your tongue
before you can swallow it.
</P>
<P>
   Laetitia's picnic site is one of the best in the region,
offering 360-degree views.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Valley's labels may not be household names but some can be
found in eclectic wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   One name that is probably more familiar is Corbett Canyon
Vineyards _ but only because it uses a gimmicky, square bottle and
has saturated radio markets with commercials that employ an
annoying echo and jingle. Corbett Canyon, which does not maintain a
tasting room, buys most of its grapes from the Central Valley,
according to the Edna Valley Arroyo Grande Valley Vintners'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers wishing to sample what the region has to offer might
want to plan a trip to coincide with the ninth annual Harvest
Celebration, to be held Nov. 5-7 at Biddle Regional Park in rural
land east of Arroyo Grande (3500 Lopez Drive). The festival will
feature gourmet food, wine tasting, barrel tastings and auctions,
with all area wineries participating. Information and tickets:
(805) 541-5868.
</P>
<P>
   On your drive into the region, you're likely to see numerous
signs of booming enterprise. There are hillsides with new vine
plantings _ not even knee-high _ as vintners undertake the patient,
five-year wait for the plants to produce viable fruit. There are
hillsides that have been newly skinned for future plantings. There
are winery buildings under construction _ including a new barrel
room at Talley, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Wine production along this area of the Central Coast is growing
at a mind-boggling rate, all in an attempt to keep pace with
consumer demand. Soon, mom and pop might have to start taking on
extra workers and scouting out more production space.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson notes that when he left academia 18 years ago, Edna
Valley pinot noir grapes were selling for $800 a ton. Now they're
commanding $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just burgeoned in the last 10-15 years,'' said Cal Poly's
Doub, who noted that wine grapes have emerged as the county's No. 1
agricultural enterprise, ``passing cattle and broccoli.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The premium and ultra-premium price segments in the wine
industry have just expanded greatly,'' he added. ``Some of the
price increases have just been amazing. It's the economy, stupid.
If you're going to smoke a $20 cigar, you've got to have a $50
bottle of wine to go with it.''

 &HT;    Both sides of gun debate should seek lower death toll
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OK, all you worthies on the other side of the gun
debate. Let's agree on at least one thing. Let's agree to do
everything we can to end the toll that guns are taking on our
children.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in The Atlanta Constitution on Thursday laid out
the arguments for taking reasonable steps to protect children from
guns, and it suggested what those steps should be. The editorial
included the names and faces of just a few of the Georgia
youngsters who have been killed by guns. How could anyone see that
gallery of tragedy and not want to prevent other families from
suffering such losses?
</P>
<P>
   Yet gun groups _ principally the National Rifle Association _
have repeatedly thwarted legislation that could save the lives of
children. State Sen. David Scott, an Atlanta Democrat, has
spearheaded the effort to pass such laws for years.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, defeat has not diminished his determination. Scott has
gone as far to invite the NRA to the table to help draft
legislation. But it has been to no avail. There have been times
when he thought he had convinced the organization not to oppose a
bill, only to have NRA lobbyists work to kill it. He has seen the
NRA fight his legislation in the Georgia Legislature after it had
given its blessing to similar bills in other states.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe the NRA or individual gun owners want children
to die. As fervently as they believe in the Second Amendment, I
don't believe they would accept the deaths of the 4,000 children
who are killed by guns in this country each year as the price for
preserving the constitutional right to bear arms. But there are
times when the NRA and gun enthusiasts give the appearance of
valuing guns over children.
</P>
<P>
   It is fine to teach children about gun safety. But children are
children, and they and their friends don't have the judgment to
always follow the rules for handling such a lethal object. There
are hundreds of ways adults try to protect children from
themselves. We require drug companies to put potentially harmful
medicines in child-proof packages. But the Georgia Legislature
won't mandate child-proof guns by requiring that they all have
trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   When a law is proposed to hold adults accountable for leaving
guns where children can find them and injure or kill themselves or
others, the gun lobby talks about infringing on the rights of
responsible gun owners. But why lump responsible gun owners with
the irresponsible? The law wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that makes the least sense to me is the one that
says legislation forcing people to put trigger locks on guns and
store them unloaded in a place that's inaccessible to children
would only make families less safe. Supposedly, those steps make it
impossible to use the gun against an intruder in the house.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics show that a gun brings greater danger into the
home, not safety. The chances that the gun will be used in domestic
violence, in a suicide or result in the accidental death of a child
are far greater than the chance it will be used to ward off an
intruder.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse _ and it's mostly for worse _ the gun is
well established in American society. That there is some degree of
constitutional protection of the right to own guns is undeniable.
Most people who want to have guns are going to have them.
</P>
<P>
   But even those circumstances don't mean we have to tolerate
levels of negligence by manufacturers and irresponsibility by gun
owners that result in the needless deaths of 4,000 children a year.

 &HT;    Skin line sells like oil off an emu's back
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Not to ruffle any feathers, but compared
with graceful swans, regal eagles or Technicolor parrots, emus
aren't the most aesthetically pleasing members of the bird kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the cosmetic use of emu oil _ in its unrefined state
a foul-smelling, pale yellow substance from a thick pad of fat on
the bird's back _ all the more ironic.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Beach's Planet Emu is one of several companies banking on
emu oil to emerge as the next aloe vera. W magazine recently called
it a prime ingredient of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Emu launched its line of seven Dremu products last
November, and it's now available in more than 100 department stores
and about 50 spas, boutiques and dermatologists' offices
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sold as a skin-care product, but it actually is a
therapeutic product,'' says company President Julie Brumlik.
</P>
<P>
   Dremu is the only cosmetic line in department stores that
contains emu oil in every product, she says, although other
companies such as Donna Karan Cosmetics include emu oil in some of
their formulas.
</P>
<P>
   On the thousands of emu farms in the United States, and the
roughly 200 in Florida, emus are raised primarily as a low-fat,
iron-rich alternative to red meat. The flightless bird's oil ``has
the closest composition to the original oil that is in human skin
of any oil that we know,'' Brumlik says.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever thought to use emu oil?
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Aborigines, actually, who discovered its benefits
centuries before modern scientists. According to Planet Emu and the
American Emu Association, the oil is a natural emollient that
penetrates seven layers of skin and acts as a carrier for
anti-oxidants, vitamin C and other skin-care ingredients. Absorbed
quickly, it helps the skin retain moisture and rebalances the
fatty-acid composition in older skin, making it appear plumper and
therefore younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dermabrasion and acid peels are rough ways to resurface the
skin,'' Brumlik says. ``Emu oil is a more gentle, modern way to do
the same thing. ... You don't have to have pain to get the gain
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emu oil also is anti-inflammatory. Dremu recommends its Pain
Relief Extra Strength Thermal Therapy, a mix of 40 percent pure emu
oil and nine other analgesic oils, as an antidote to sore muscles
and stiff joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety and number of skin conditions that we're able to
improve has turned out to be sort of astounding,'' says Brumlik,
adding that it's all backed by clinical research.
</P>
<P>
   But Ira Schlesinger, a Delray Beach dermatologist, says emus
haven't shown their memorable mugs in the scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, it fits into the category of what's new
for the month,'' Schlesinger says. ``In the dermatological
journals, there's no current mention of anything that's been proven
with that product. ... I am not aware of any scientific data of
(emu oil) doing anything other than moisturizing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all bad. ``Moisturizing makes all skin look
better,'' Schlesinger says. ``It temporarily makes wrinkles and
aging skin look better. ... But true value comes beyond that, in
changing the structural components of the skin, and I'm not aware
of any evidence that that occurs (with emu oil).''
</P>
<P>
   Customers seem to like the stuff, though. Brumlik says after
Vogue magazine published a story, department stores started
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the perpetually grounded emu, Dremu sales took flight.
</P>
<P>
   THE MANY FACES OF EMU
</P>
<P>
   Dremu's emu-oil products include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Daylight Age Defying Lotion: daily moisturizer with Vitamin C
and SPF 15. $38 for 2 oz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cashmere: hand and body lotion with ylang-ylang. $30 for 8 oz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Airbrush Refining Eye Cream: ceramides, elastin, collagen and
green tea extract to reduce puffiness. $38 for 0.5 oz.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whistle Moisturizing Facial Cleanser: nonfoaming cleanser with
Japanese grapefruit scent. $22 for 8 oz.
</P>
<P>
   You can order Dremu by calling (800) 373-4011 or by visiting
www.dremu.com.

 &HT;    Regulatory-agency bureaucrats can wield unrestrained power
 &HT;    By Jim Wooten
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you long for unrestrained power in a democracy,
start taking notes now.
</P>
<P>
   You can be a governor. Nice house, car with driver, suck-ups
galore.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can be filthy rich and create foundations. Those monetize
your values and execute your personal agenda and do it with
respectability. Thereafter, you can influence government, the
public and the media without drawing critical examination. A
foundation is a way to wash political money.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the ``Georgia Airkeepers Campaign,'' for example,
lists among its members a grab-bag assortment of nonrevealing
gibberish names, such as the Southern Organizing Committee for
Economic and Social Justice, and among its funding sources
``private foundation donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you know the political agenda and composition of the
groups and the political agenda of the foundations, you really
shouldn't take them or their ``research studies'' too seriously.
Nor should you read the phrase ``nonprofit'' or ``nonpartisan'' to
mean ``unbiased'' or without a point of view. All that means is
that they're trying to hide their bias.
</P>
<P>
   The third route to unrestrained power is to become a
regulatory-agency bureaucrat. This is the wallflower's path. You
don't have to subject your opinions to public scrutiny, where the
really wacky ones get slaughtered. The power to write the regs is
the power to implement an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   An example, a small one, of the power of the unexamined
bureaucrat is an exercise now under way in Washington to redefine
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new formula being considered by the White House Office
of Management and Budget, a family of four would be poor if their
annual income is less than $19,500 per year. The current level is
$16,500.
</P>
<P>
   With a stroke of the pen, the number of people defined as poor
would jump from 12.7 percent of the population to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the effort makes sense. Numbers that automatically
trigger some program or activity, whether the poverty definition
for benefits or the income tax burden, should be adjusted to
reflect inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But it does bear watching. As we've discovered, the power to
establish regulatory and program-triggering thresholds is an
enormous lever for those with an undeclared agenda.
</P>
<P>
   When the Environmental Protection Agency sets air and water
standards, for example, it represents an extraordinary power to
divert resources to its agenda to the exclusion of other worthwhile
needs. When the civil rights division of the Justice Department
interprets the Voting Rights Act to require a specified number of
minority-controlled districts, for example, it is dictating
outcome, usurping the power of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   In all of these, bureaucrats who are really accountable to
nobody, and who are rarely even called on to justify their
reasoning, steal the power of elected officals _ often with the
concurrence of other elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   So a simple thing _ adjusting numbers to reflect current reality
_ can represent enormous power for those with unexamined agendas.
Ever wonder why it's impossible to kill off federal programs, even
after documenting that they don't work or that the need is not
there? The reason is that poverty supports a middle-class
management industry that prospers by constructing programs to serve
the ``poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjust the numbers, therefore, and the poverty-managing industry
is able to project the myth that only the rich are benefiting from
a good economy. The programs they design and administer, ergo, are
needed now more than ever. After all, 17 percent of Americans may
now be living in poverty.

   Tampa Bay has won five of its last seven home games against the
Bears, including the last three. That streak will continue. The
rookie quarterback Cade McNown gets the start for Chicago, and he
will quickly be reminded by a top Buccaneers defense that he is not
at UCLA anymore. Enis can expect to get at least 25 carries to keep
the pressure off, but McNown should expect a few visits from Warren
Sapp. Trent Dilfer update: He's still terrible.

   What the Colts have lacked is a killer instinct; the common
refrain around the league is that they do not know how to close out
a game. That changed last week when Indianapolis was able to stop
the Jets and win the game. In that contest the young Colts grew up.
These games are usually close _ five of the last seven meetings
between the two teams have been decided by 7 points or fewer _ but
this game will not be. Indianapolis now knows how to win, which
means it will not lose to one of the worst teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 35-14
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (0-6) at St. Louis (5-0)

   The league is still waiting for the Rams to fall. They will have
to keep waiting at least one more week. The Browns are trying _
they are losing by fewer points a game than they were earlier in
the season _ but their defense is no match for this scary St. Louis
offense. The Rams will be 6-0 for the first time since 1985.
Quarterback Kurt Warner's completion percentage leads the league;
the highest for a season is 70.55 by Ken Anderson. That's how
topsy-turvy the league is _ a former arena league player is
suddenly Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 40-17
</P>
<P>
   Denver (2-4) at New England (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the more crucial games of the week. The Broncos
plastered Green Bay last Sunday by 31-10. It may be that
quarterback Brian Griese is finally showing the skill that Shanahan
believed he has always had. Meanwhile the wheels are falling off
the Patriots, and people are quickly jumping from the bandwagon.
Last week's horrible loss to Miami is lingering like a bad meal.
New England still has not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 25-24
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (3-2) at Carolina (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   Carolina has won two of the its last three games and is starting
to gain some momentum. The reasons are quarterback Steve Beuerlein
and running back Tim Biakabutuka. The steady veteran passer has a
sharp 87.5 rating and Biakabutuka has rushed for 449 yards, second
in the conference. Carolina should have a good day against a Lions
defense that gives up 322 yards a game and against a battered
Charlie Batch, the much-pounded Detroit quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 29-21
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (1-4) at Giants (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will be in the playoff chase all season, winning a
game here, losing a game there. After every victory like the one
against Dallas on Monday night, there will come a loss like the one
they will experience against New Orleans. The Giants are just that
kind of team. New York has the conference's third-ranked rushing
defense, so don't expect Ricky Williams to break loose. But the
Saints will have just enough offense to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 10-9
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (2-4) at Miami (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles may have beaten the Cowboys this season, but in light
of Dallas' offensive problems, that is not so impressive anymore.
Miami should win this one easily. The Dolphins have won 8 of their
last 10 home games and are 4-0 against Philadelphia, and Coach
Jimmy Johnson has won four of his last five against the Eagles.
Quarterback Dan Marino is questionable because of bone spurs in his
neck and a shoulder injury; Damon Huard probably gets the start.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 35-17
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (3-3) at Minnesota (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach Denny Green's decision to start the backup
quarterback Jeff George this week was a smart one. Randall
Cunningham, the best thrower in the league last year, was shot.
George may have cobwebs in the cranium at times, but his arm
strength and quick decisions under pressure _ especially when a
team blitzes _ will do the Minnesota offense wonders. This will be
a game when Randy Moss makes three touchdown catches against a
49ers defense that in the last three games has given up 22 plays of
20 or more yards. Steve Young sits this one out with a concussion.

   Mike Riley seeks to become the first head coach to open his
Chargers career with victories in five of six games. Riley is
riding his defense, which has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 24
games. The defense has also allowed an NFL-low nine trips into the
red zone. The Packers have not seen a defense like this in years,
and quarterback Brett Favre will surely be bounced around. The
Packers must hope the injured thumb on his throwing hand stays
fairly stable.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 14-12
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (4-2) at Seattle (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are able to figure out Flutie and shut him down. A
team with an athletic front four can keep up with the Buffalo
quarterback, and that is why the Oakland Raiders beat the Bills
last week. Seattle has a similar front in defensive linemen Riddick
Parker (a sack in each of the last two games), Michael Sinclair and
Cortez Kennedy. Flutie will again be scrambling for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   Jets (1-5) at Oakland (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are a disaster and Coach Bill Parcells is partially to
blame. By trading for Rick Mirer, he made a major tactical error,
because Mirer is the worst quarterback in New York since Tommy
Maddox. On 34 third-down opportunities this season, Mirer has
thrown three interceptions for a quarterback rating of 7.2. That's
single digits. With him at the helm, the Jets may not win another
game. Oakland's Tyrone Wheatley is tied with Jacksonville's James
Stewart for the AFC lead with five rushing touchdowns. The former
Giant is motivated to run over anything with New York in its name.

   The Falcons are done as a playoff team, stuck in the dreary role
of spoiler. The Steelers, despite their offensive woes, can still
be a factor. Quarterback Kordell Stewart is struggling with just a
68.3 passer rating, but running back Jerome Bettis is starting to
get back on track. The Falcons' defense will put up little
resistance.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   UNDATED _ The new film ``The Best Man'' is built around a piece
of information that is supposed to build suspense, but it's so
obvious that it makes the characters look silly for not having
figured it out until the weekend of the wedding. If you're willing
to suspend disbelief for the length of the picture, you'll have a

   UNDATED _ In a review I don't entirely agree with, Pauline Kael

   UNDATED _ In ``Bringing Out The Dead,'' Nicolas Cage looks so
exhausted, even his eyes have a 5 o'clock shadow. He's Frank, a

   UNDATED _ Somebody involved in the advertising of ``Body Shots''
actually had the nerve to come up with the tagline, ``There are
movies that define every decade ...'' Yeah, there are, but ``Body
Shots'' isn't one of them, unless you've spent the decade with your
nose buried in magazine sex-advice columns. This overdirected,
pretentious film has about as much depth as an average ``Friends''
episode, although come to think of it, ``Friends'' is more
decade-defining, even with its well-chronicled lack of diversity.

   FILM-BOYS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Boys Don't Cry'' displays a unique intimacy.
Director Kimberly Peirce makes the movie seem both intensely felt
and modest in scale, a story of a small-town kid with epic
feelings. (It's reminiscent of ``East of Eden.'') The women
communicate in unactorly ways; the camera often seems to be a
voyeur in the girls' locker room. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has

   FILM-BATS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ What Alfred Hitchock understood with ``The Birds,''
and Steven Spielberg understood with ``Jaws,'' is that when you
make a ``when animals attack'' movie, it helps to have humans who
are at least as interesting as the animals. ``Bats,'' like too many
other films, forgets this, giving us stock characters _ stolid
sheriff, spunky zoologist, her wisecracking assistant, earnest
Centers for Disease Control official and mad scientist _ battling

then, many different methods of thinking have been conceived, but
few have such a documented track record as the one developed by the

Mineral waters await the weary in Avila Beach  &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVILA BEACH, Calif. _ The figures appear like apparitions at all
hours of the day and night, silently climbing a staircase up the
steep slope, padding across a boardwalk, following pathways into
remote corners of the oak grove.
</P>
<P>
   They all seek the waters, the antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Steaming-hot mineral water has been gurgling from a hillside
near San Luis Obispo for more than 100 years, ever since two
wildcatters drilling for oil instead struck an artesian well heated
deep inside the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort stands on the site,
accommodating visitors who have come to appreciate the water's
properties of rejuvenation. There may be no better way to ease
knots of urban stress, soothe overworked muscles or just escape the
bone-chilling fog and drizzle that envelops this stretch of the
Central Coast for so much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think immersion in these waters would cure ills
like polio and gout,'' said general manager Charles Yates. ``They
can't do that, but they sure can make you feel a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests on the water reveal that the predominant minerals are
white sulfur and sodium bicarbonate _ essentially baking soda,
Yates said. ``These are natural ingredients that really tenderize
you, make your skin soft.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort takes full advantage of the water's appeal. It
maintains 19 jetted redwood hot tubs, seating from two to eight
people, on a steep hillside behind the hotel. Each guest room has
its own private acrylic tub on a balcony or deck. The swimming pool
is heated with mineral water. And the Oasis Spa, accented with
rocks and waterfalls, will seat 40.
</P>
<P>
   The redwood tubs are open to the public as well as hotel guests,
and they are open 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to see figures in terry cloth bathrobes
crossing the parking lot at 2 a.m., or weary professionals from San
Luis Obispo stopping by after work on raw, misty afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   For non-guests, the tubs rent for $10 per person per hour from
Monday through Thursday, $12.50 on weekends (children's rates
lower). If hotel guests want to leave the private spas of their
rooms and step into one of the redwood units on the hillside,
they're supposed to be charged half that rate _ $5 and $6.25,
respectively _ but during a recent stay, outside demand was slack,
and the spa personnel did not charge four guests for two different
visits to the redwood tubs.
</P>
<P>
   The prices might seem a bit steep for non-guests, but they
probably reflect the operation's considerable overhead. Yates said
each tub is drained and cleaned twice a day, and each has a
filtering system that processes the tub's entire volume in five
minutes. A computerized diode system also monitors and
automatically adjusts chloride and pH levels.
</P>
<P>
   The water is supposedly maintained at between 105 and 108
degrees, although one tub was found to be much cooler one evening.
No matter. There are two faucets at each tub, one of hot mineral
water if you wish to raise the temperature, one of cold tap water
if you want to temper it a bit. Within minutes, you can raise or
lower the temperature significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The management has no quarrel if you want to sip an alcoholic
beverage while soaking, it just requires that you make that
purchase on the premises _ at a gift store that also stays open 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The tubs are particularly appealing at night, when you can sink
into the waters and gaze up through the dark silhouettes of the
mature oaks, the branches of which create a comforting canopy. When
the coastal fog retreats, the stars are resplendent overhead _
there is little urban light reflection to compete with them here.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this is a slice of Marin County life, circa 1978.
The hot tubs, each discreetly screened from its neighbors by
redwood fencing and shrubbery, are named, not numbered:
Enchantment, Paradise, Starlight, Gemini. Similarly, the resort
buildings are named (Endeavor, Harmony, Eminence), as are the
rooms. When charging something to your room, you have to overcome
any self-consciousness while saying, ``Yes, uh, I'm staying in
Intimate.'' (Among other room names: Sensitive, Patience, Hopeful,
Tickle.)
</P>
<P>
   A stay at the resort can be enhanced by some advance knowledge.
It has one building that was constructed in the 1960s, another in
the 1970s, two others that went up only two years ago, plus a
separate bed-and-breakfast inn and a cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, reservations clerks seem to funnel callers to the
oldest building, and trumpet a first-floor room as if it is
desirable. It is not. In the creaking, wood-frame structure, water
rushing through drains sends up a considerable din, and any foot
traffic above comes off like a thundering herd _ not particularly
pleasant at the crack of dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Yates said a future renovation project will involve
tearing off the second floor and replacing it with lightweight
concrete and steel.
</P>
<P>
   These older rooms are priced at $109 nightly. Suites in the
newer buildings range from $169 to $300, depending on time of the
year and time of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The resort offers other spa treatments, including a half-hour
back massage ($45) and an hour-long European facial ($70). Each
treatment comes with a presoak in one of the redwood tubs.
</P>
<P>
   There are also various room packages available, including such
amenities as spa treatments, golf at one of two nearby courses or
credits toward dinner in the hotel's restaurant, the Gardens of
Avila.
</P>
<P>
   There are not a great number of fine-dining options along this
stretch of the Central Coast, but this is certainly one _ although
a couple of glitches were encountered recently. Eleven main
courses, priced from $12.95 to $23.95, are cleverly planned and
presented by chef Christian Raia.
</P>
<P>
   One member of our group found the prime rib to be closer to
medium than the medium rare he ordered, but raves were heard for
the veal tortellini, which was served with prosciutto, peas and
marsala cream.
</P>
<P>
   Short supply seemed to be an issue on a Monday night. When baked
mushrooms were ordered as an appetizer, the server returned shortly
to inform us that ``there isn't a mushroom in the house.'' The
house also must have run out of crumbled blue cheese _ that or a
salad chef got distracted; one salad featured it, as advertised,
three others did not. Espresso with dessert? Nope, the machine was
on the fritz. Irish coffee then? Sorry, they were out of Bushmills.
</P>
<P>
   At Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort, however, guests don't seem
to get overly troubled if they get stuck on the first floor of the
Adventure Building or if a dining experience is a bit uneven.
</P>
<P>
   They come, after all, for the tubs. They come for the waters.
</P>
<P>
   After just a few minutes of immersion in that water, concerns
great and small magically seem to melt away.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort is at 1215 Avila Beach
Drive, about 10 miles south of San Luis Obispo. Phone: (805)

 &HT;    OFFICIALS URGE PLANNING FOR Y2K CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The overwhelming majority of small- and
medium-sized chemical plants are so unprepared to deal with the Y2K
computer bug that state and local emergency workers should
immediately begin ``contingency planning'' for accidents, the
Senate Special Committee on Y2K announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
vice chairman of the committee. ``Developing viable Y2K contingency
plans in conjunction with state and local officials must be a top
priority in the chemical industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee cited a study conducted by Texas A&AMP;M University
researchers, who found that 86.5 percent of chemical companies
surveyed in Texas, New Jersey, Kansas and California ``weren't
prepared'' for Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a programming flaw that could cause older
computers and chips embedded in equipment to misread dates
beginning with Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly small glitch could create big problems in plants
where the flow of hazardous chemicals is regulated by computerized
equipment. If the bug causes machinery to malfunction, dangerous
gases or liquids could be released.
</P>
<P>
   With about 85 million Americans living within five miles of one
of the nation's 66,000 work sites that make or use chemicals, many
people should be prepared to evacuate their homes in case of
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the probability of a Y2K-related disruption is low, the
potential harm even one chemical accident can cause means we must
be especially vigilant,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dodd and Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, who chairs the Senate
committee, urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
Environmental Protection Agency to put state and local emergency
managers on alert.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas A&AMP;M survey results were characterized as ``grave'' by
Gerald Poje, a member of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board. He believes local fire chiefs should begin
``knocking on doors'' at chemical plants to get answers about
possible Y2K-related hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Poje says that fixing Y2K problems in the chemical sector is
difficult because the plants are so ``heterogenous'' compared with
other industries. For example, the electric power industry is
united by trade associations, connections on the power grid and
similarity of operations. Those links make it easier for industry
officials to share information and solve Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   But chemical plants are diverse, with some handling fluids,
others producing gases and still other using manufacturing solids
such as fertilizers. Indeed, many firms don't even call themselves
``chemical'' companies, even though they handle huge amounts of
chemicals. Paper mills are good examples, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When all of the plants that handle dangerous chemicals are added
up, the numbers run into the hundreds of thousands, he said. Even
if only a small percentage have problems, the consequences could be
great.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas study posed the question to chemical plant operators:
``What is the worst thing that could happen if you had a Y2K
failure?'' While nearly half of respondents said nothing of
consequence would occur, 4.1 percent saw the ``potential for a
catastrophic event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Y2K and Society, a Washington-based nonprofit
group, urged the federal government to order a ``safety holiday''
for the chemical industry over New Year's Eve weekend. But Poje
said a shutdown would not necessarily solve problems, because some
plants become more dangerous when they interrupt continuous
operations and then try to restart. He believes each plant manager
should make his own determination about operating on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But given that not every plant manager will make the right call,
local emergency officials should prepare for possible accidents, he
said. ``There is an urgent need for people to take this
seriously,'' he said.

 &HT;    OFFICIALS URGE PLANNING FOR Y2K CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The overwhelming majority of small- and
medium-sized chemical plants are so unprepared to deal with the Y2K
computer bug that state and local emergency workers should
immediately begin ``contingency planning'' for accidents, the
Senate Special Committee on Y2K announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
vice chairman of the committee. ``Developing viable Y2K contingency
plans in conjunction with state and local officials must be a top
priority in the chemical industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee cited a study conducted by Texas A&AMP;M University
researchers, who found that 86.5 percent of chemical companies
surveyed in Texas, New Jersey, Kansas and California ``weren't
prepared'' for Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a programming flaw that could cause older
computers and chips embedded in equipment to misread dates
beginning with Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly small glitch could create big problems in plants
where the flow of hazardous chemicals is regulated by computerized
equipment. If the bug causes machinery to malfunction, dangerous
gases or liquids could be released.
</P>
<P>
   With about 85 million Americans living within five miles of one
of the nation's 66,000 work sites that make or use chemicals, many
people should be prepared to evacuate their homes in case of
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the probability of a Y2K-related disruption is low, the
potential harm even one chemical accident can cause means we must
be especially vigilant,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dodd and Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, who chairs the Senate
committee, urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
Environmental Protection Agency to put state and local emergency
managers on alert.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas A&AMP;M survey results were characterized as ``grave'' by
Gerald Poje, a member of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board. He believes local fire chiefs should begin
``knocking on doors'' at chemical plants to get answers about
possible Y2K-related hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Poje says that fixing Y2K problems in the chemical sector is
difficult because the plants are so ``heterogenous'' compared with
other industries. For example, the electric power industry is
united by trade associations, connections on the power grid and
similarity of operations. Those links make it easier for industry
officials to share information and solve Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   But chemical plants are diverse, with some handling fluids,
others producing gases and still other using manufacturing solids
such as fertilizers. Indeed, many firms don't even call themselves
``chemical'' companies, even though they handle huge amounts of
chemicals. Paper mills are good examples, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When all of the plants that handle dangerous chemicals are added
up, the numbers run into the hundreds of thousands, he said. Even
if only a small percentage have problems, the consequences could be
great.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas study posed the question to chemical plant operators:
``What is the worst thing that could happen if you had a Y2K
failure?'' While nearly half of respondents said nothing of
consequence would occur, 4.1 percent saw the ``potential for a
catastrophic event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Y2K and Society, a Washington-based nonprofit
group, urged the federal government to order a ``safety holiday''
for the chemical industry over New Year's Eve weekend. But Poje
said a shutdown would not necessarily solve problems, because some
plants become more dangerous when they interrupt continuous
operations and then try to restart. He believes each plant manager
should make his own determination about operating on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But given that not every plant manager will make the right call,
local emergency officials should prepare for possible accidents, he
said. ``There is an urgent need for people to take this
seriously,'' he said.

THERE'S POLITICALLY INCORRECT AND JUST PLAIN INCORRECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed to me I'd heard that refrain before.
</P>
<P>
   The political science professor delivered a broadside against
those whose world views incline toward the left for attempting to
curtail First Amendment rights and stifling public debate in both
academia and the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Waxing very righteously indignant, he stopped just short of
equating so-called political correctness, in his view an
abomination from the left, with the McCarthyism of the '50s. And he
suggested that the most dynamic political thinking in the country
today is coming from the right.
</P>
<P>
   That professor is widely viewed as a liberal, although some of
his published writings of late suggest otherwise. His recent strong
expression of support for school vouchers, for example, evidences a
right-ward drift.
</P>
<P>
   The professor delivered his slap at the American left during a
panel discussion last week of so-called ``political correctness''
at Tarrant County College's Arlington campus.
</P>
<P>
   He was, I presumed at first, just playing devil's advocate and
attempting to live up to his image as an equal opportunity
iconoclast. If that were the case, he played that role too well.
The professor made it appear that he thought he was displaying
considerable intestinal fortitude by accusing the left of poisoning
the well of public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't take much in the way of political courage
to exalt the right and castigate the left deep in the heart of
politically conservative Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it did seem to me I'd heard that song before. Either
the professor had read and remembered a column that Paul Greenberg,
a former liberal of sorts, wrote back in April or another instance
of above average minds running in similar veins had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In that column, the Arkansas curmudgeon, one of the nation's
most prolific Bill Clinton bashers, let fly a quiver of
porcupine-sharp barbs against contemporary liberals, all introduced
with the refrain, ``The trouble with the left. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg commenced his repetitive and often self-contradictory
diatribe with the silly (there is no politically correct way to
describe it) assertion: ``The trouble with the left is that it has
fallen out of love with freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas pundit appeared to be much troubled by the efforts
of liberals to promote equal opportunity and verbal respect among
the diverse demographic elements of America's peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with the left is that it has come to believe in
privileged classes based on sex, race and class. ... The trouble
with the left is that it has confused fairness with political
correctness, and dialogue with rigged conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, Greenberg's First Amendment right to oppose
affirmative action and the various euphemisms now in vogue for
differentiating among people on the basis of race, sex, national
origin or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, those on the troubled left also have the
constitutional right to characterize his views as intolerant,
insensitive and perhaps hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the crux of the problem I had with the political
science professor's assertions about political correctness, liberal
oppression and the new interesting concepts coming from the right.
</P>
<P>
   The professor appeared to be saying that public discussion and
the learning atmosphere in academia could be enhanced if people
felt free to say anything they wish in any way they wish without
regard to any standards of civility.
</P>
<P>
   I submit that far more harm than good would accrue if people
went around hurling stereotypical and hurtful racial, sexual and
lifestyle adjectives at each other. Certainly the level of violence
would increase. It is possible to hold productive and heated debate
without sinking to such lows.
</P>
<P>
   The professor insisted, however, that he was more concerned
about the suppression of unpopular views. And that would be
something he should be concerned about were it happening to a
significant degree. But criticism, even scathing ridicule which is
the province of the right, is not suppression.
</P>
<P>
   One can still say anything one wishes in this country,
especially on talk radio, without fear of governmental retaliation.
And a really good teacher can find ways to stimulate debate among
students that remain within the bounds of civility.
</P>
<P>
   What most troubled me, of course, was the professor's
characterization of the right as the direction from which the most
stimulating new thought is coming today. In light of the
neo-isolationism, neo-sexism, neo-racism, neo-classism and
neo-fundamentalism emanating from the right, such an assertion is
not just politically incorrect, it's factually incorrect.

SHORT ITEMS ON WHAT'S NEW IN HOME VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   See the U.S.A. In a Chevrolet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a nice copy to show my kids,'' said Monte Hellman,
the director of ``Two-Lane Blacktop.'' This week he got one when
Anchor Bay released that classic 1971 road film, starring James
Taylor, Warren Oates, Dennis Wilson and Laurie Bird, on tape and
DVD. Either way is fine with Hellman; the movie has never been on
video. But DVD is better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On disk, ``they take pains to make it look as close to the way
it did as possible,'' he said. In the wide-screen format, the image
is flattened to its original rectangular proportions, allowing
figures lopped off for television back into the action.
</P>
<P>
   That's an advantage to any film, of course, but especially one
about a road race that takes off across the country. And there are
other ways DVD lends authenticity to a film half jokingly referred
to as the only existential allegory ever made for a studio.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman made the movie for Universal, but years later there was
trouble over video. Repairing to a closet-size room in the London
office of Gary Kurtz, the film's associate producer, Hellman and
Kurtz watched the film on a small television screen while they told
the story for a commentary track on the DVD.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Hellman said, he was invited by Scarecrow
Video, a Seattle company, to show the film there. Astounded that
the movie wasn't on video, Scarecrow and other fans began a
petition. Hellman himself had been trying to find out why it wasn't
on tape. ``We never got a straight answer from Universal,'' he says
in the disk commentary.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was securing music rights for songs like ``Moonlight
Ride'' by the Doors and ``Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones.
Universal finally was of some help, but the task was carried
through by Anchor Bay, which could have substituted lesser-known
selections but stayed true to the original.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity, laconic and haunting, is vital to every aspect of
the film, and the reflective, low-key commentary only adds to an
indelible sense of it. At the wheel of a hopped-up 1955 Chevrolet,
the Driver ( Taylor) challenges GTO ( Oates, who earned an Oscar
nomination) to a race. A good old boy, GTO is named for his
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Driver is aided by the Mechanic ( Wilson of the Beach Boys).
Normally they roam Western tank towns taking money from the locals
at clandestine drag races. The race with GTO will be a long one,
all the way to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Along for the ride, as long as her whim dictates, is the Girl
(Ms. Bird). ``She doesn't seem to be breathing right,'' says the
Mechanic at one point. He means the Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Made for $875,000, ``Two-Lane Blacktop'' cuts with aching
poignancy through forlorn towns of the late '60s and early '70s.
Bit players _ police officers, shopkeepers, filling-station
operators, boys playing baseball _ were ordinary citizens recruited
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor wasn't famous yet. ``He had his first hit, `Fire and
Rain,' when we were on location,'' Hellman said. Now films need
name actors to get made, but they didn't then. ``They just wanted
people who were right for the movie,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Blair Witch Project &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Definitely the camping trip of the summer, Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sanchez's pseudo-documentary, made in eight days with no
script, sends three film students into the Maryland woods in search
of legendary evil. Later the video they shot turns up as the sole
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Lost and frozen, Heather, Josh and Mike stumble through the
woods in a steadily escalating state of confusion and panic as they
begin to realize they are inescapably in the hands of they know not
what. Operating on the tightest of budgets, Myrick and Sanchez,
students themselves not long ago, turn spareness to their advantage
by extracting the utmost menace from rocks and twigs gathered into
fetishlike harbingers of approaching doom. By the end, horror has a
new face in a film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``whose scrappy home-movie style is completely, even ingeniously,
appropriate.'' &QL;

   Packing Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence off to a Mississippi
prison where they trade quips while doing hard labor may not sound
like an idea headed much of anywhere. But over 60 years Ray (
Murphy) and Claude ( Lawrence) develop a curmudgeonly feel for each
other, flashing back to the days when the two went on a bootlegging
mission and encountered racism.
</P>
<P>
   Evolving affectingly from a fast-talking hotshot into an old man

 &HT;    `Best Man' puts a little extra into relationship
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' had been more than just a
pleasant, easy-on-the-eyes movie, it would have been called ``The
Best Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit Julia Roberts. Enter Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   In Malcolm D. Lee's often funny, sexy and prickly new
comedy-drama, Diggs heads a talented ensemble cast in an outright
contender for fall's best date movie: a glossy wedding film
punctuated with soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder,
Me'Shell Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic
bite.
</P>
<P>
   It's a plot that occasionally digs deep into the intricate
nature of friendship, love and sex among a group of successful
twentysomethings gathering for the union of two old college
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Many who've heard about ``The Best Man'' quickly dismiss it as a
rip-off of ``The Wood,'' last summer's remember-when, good-times
movie that not only had a wedding at its core but also starred
Diggs. But ``Best Man'' focuses far less on flashbacks and, more
than once, provokes the same kind of dramatic shivers that made
Lawrence Kasdan's reunion hit ``The Big Chill'' such a big thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs plays Harper Stewart, the film's title groomsman and an
up-and-coming writer. His steamy new book, a coming-of-age tale
about a collegian and his guy and gal pals, is about to get played
large on ``Oprah.'' Naturally, Harper's friends _ nicely played by
Morris Chestnut, Nia Long, Harold Perrineau, Monica Calhoun and,
especially, Terrence Howard _ are more than curious about how their
lives are portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   One key scene involves a poker game, in which the guys'
requisite male bonding turns into a frank and challenging thesis on
fidelity. It evokes the kind of raw, emotional power you just don't
get in all-jokey relationship films like ``The Story of Us.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, it makes ``The Best Man'' better than ``My Best
Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long and Morris Chestnut. Written and
directed by Malcolm D. Lee. Rated R for profanity and sexuality. 1
hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A fun, challenging wedding flick with great music
and a talented ensemble cast.
</P>

 &HT;    Martin Scorsese's savage tale of a fried paramedic on the scuzzy
side of Manhattan rides rough, but rolls
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a cast list includes credits like ``Homeless Suicide'' or
``Man With Bleeding Foot,'' you have every right to think you're
watching an episode of ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a way, that's what ``Bringing Out the Dead'' is. Only,
as the ``South Park'' movie bragged, ``bigger, longer and uncut.''
Which, given that the director is Martin Scorsese, translates into
grungier, more brutal and a downer. But no one does downers better
than Scorsese, and, despite a central narrative flaw, this one's a
doozy.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Joe Connelly's semiautobiographical best
seller, the picture follows a few days in the life of a New York
City paramedic (Nicolas Cage in full ``Leaving Las Vegas'' mode, so
gutter ripe you can almost smell him). Cage's beat is the mean,
messy streets of Hell's Kitchen, on the aptly named graveyard
shift. He's alcoholic, sleep-deprived and sick of his job. Worse,
he's soul-sick, haunted by the ghosts of the people he couldn't
save.
</P>
<P>
   He has come to believe ``in spirits leaving the body and not
wanting to come back,'' and that his role is ``less about saving
lives than bearing witness.'' But that doesn't keep his ghosts at
bay. He hasn't saved a life in months, and he's become particularly
obsessed with a young woman named Rosa, whose face he sees
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by longtime Scorsese collaborator Paul Schrader,
can't help but echo their most famous film, ``Taxi Driver.'' The
same neon nightmare of after-hours Manhattan (though, in the
ensuing two decades, Scorsese's camera work has gotten a lot
flashier). The same episodic sense of chaos on a cruise from one
incident (passenger, victim) to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle was
bonkers; Cage is a burnout case. What they share is what all
Scorsese's protagonists have in common: an aching need for
absolution. In one epiphany of a scene, Cage pictures his ghosts
pulling one another out of the fetid pavement _ spirits rescuing
other spirits. Yet he can't forgive himself, for Rosa or for all
the other Rosas.
</P>
<P>
   Where the movie skids is in its attempt to create a central plot
involving a heart attack victim and his repressed, strung-out
daughter (Patricia Arquette, who just coincidentally is also Mrs.
Nicolas Cage). The father, caught in an endless cycle of tubes and
sedatives, becomes emblematic of all those spirits that don't want
to be chained to their body. Arquette, meanwhile, is supposed to
add a kind of romantic interest _ or at least an emotional safe
harbor of sorts for Cage.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether the fault is Arquette's acting or her
poorly written character (Schrader and Scorsese still sometimes
have female trouble). Either way, the scenes focusing on her and
Cage feel forced. Like an unwanted interruption of what's really
going on: the madness and mess of the paramedics' job.
</P>
<P>
   The movie jumps to life when Cage and his various partners (John
Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom Sizemore, all excellent) go careening
through the streets on their emergency calls. And the calls range
from the dead serious to the absurd (``a woman says she's been
abducted by her cat,'' reports the unseen dispatcher, voiced by
Scorsese). For every gunshot wound to the chest, there's the
requisite visit to pick up ``our most frequent flier,'' a smelly
old drunk who always passes out on the sidewalk instead of in the
privacy of his own place. Plus, watch for singer Marc Anthony as a
sympathetic loony and emergency room regular looking like a
fugitive from a ``Godspell'' revival.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's episodic nature can mean something of a rough ride
for audiences. Plus, there's no true catharsis. The peace Cage
finally finds doesn't have the full emotional resolution it strives
for.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Scorsese has delivered a film that's both savage and
sorrowing. One that suggests that, sometimes, the life you save may
be your own. And that in itself can be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia Arquette. Directed by Martin
Scorsese. Rated R for gritty violent content, drug use and
profanity. 2 hours, 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Another deft Scorsese autopsy of New York after
dark and the dark night of one man's soul.

   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo
</P>
<P>
   in Grouchland'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elmo (voice by Kevin Clash), Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of extended episode of ``Sesame Street,'' this movie is
recommended to the very, very, very young. Essentially, little Elmo
(voice by Kevin Clash) must go to Grouchland to rescue his blanket
from a meanie named Huxley (a hammy Mandy Patinkin). Vanessa
Williams appears as the Queen of Trash. Fill in your own joke.
(ERG) 1 hour, 10 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Alma'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Alma Thorpe,
</P>
<P>
   Margie Thorpe and James Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Ruth Leitman's provocative 1997 documentary of a
peculiar Atlanta family. It's a slow, mesmerizing march from
curious looks at the family's eccentricities to the spell-bounding
horror imbedded in their history. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 34 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' Not rated but the theme may be
</P>
<P>
   too mature for children.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marie Riviere
</P>
<P>
   and Beatrice Romand.
</P>
<P>
   Magali (Beatrice Romand), a long-widowed Frenchwoman in her
mid-40s becomes the object of matchmaking by her longtime best
friend (Marie Riviere) and by the young woman (Alexia Portal) who's
dating Magali's son. The film is overflowing with generosity, humor
and insight, and master director Eric Rohmer, now almost 80,
imparts wisdom that's aged to perfection. Subtitles. (ERG)1 hour,
52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats'' R (profanity and intense sequences
</P>
<P>
   of bat attacks)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lou Diamond Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to have bats in your belfry to enjoy this cheesy
horror flick about genetically altered, man-eating bats. For the
record, Lou Diamond Phillips is the fearless sheriff of the Texas
town where the bats have come to roost; Dina Meyer is a
bat-ologist; Leon is her assistant; and Bob Gunton is a shady
scientist. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs,
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Me'Shell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Body Shots'' R (profanity, sexual content, violence,
</P>
<P>
   alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Patrick Flanery,
</P>
<P>
   Jerry O'Connell and Amanda Peet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's proof positive that being twentysomething isn't pretty.
Eight party-hearty twentysomethings (including ``Scream 2's'' Jerry
O'Connell) traipse L.A. nightlife, get superdrunk and start having
rampant sex. The big question for two in the group: was it
consensual sex or rape? Quick, brutal and ugly, the movie may not
be any fun, but it sure delivers the dramatic goods. (Bob Longino)1
hour, 42 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   This intense, rawly unsettling film is based on the true story
of Teena Brandon, a 21-year-old woman who fiercely believed she was
a man. She cut her hair short, reversed her name and started
hanging out with some hard-drinking rednecks in rural Nebraska. The
movie, a bit unrelenting, a bit too low-budget
rough-around-the-edges, is still a remarkable achievement and
Hilary Swank gives a stunning performance. (ERG)1 hour, 54 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast of Champions'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A well-intended film of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s satiric novel about
America's consumer society consuming itself. But it's largely a
misfire, possibly because its adapter and director, Alan Rudolph,
is better suited to mood pieces than to the madcap energies of
Vonnegut's barbed but humanistic farce. (Jay Carr, The Boston
Globe) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' R (profanity, violence and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese offers a savage, sorrowing look at a few days in
the life of a paramedic whose beat is Hell's Kitchen. As played by
Nicolas Cage, he's alcoholic, burnt-out and haunted by the spirits
of those he couldn't save. A kinda romance with Patricia Arquette
doesn't work, but there's excellent work by John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore as Cage's various partners. (ERG) 2 hours,
1 minute. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' PG-13 (violence, thematic material,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith,
</P>
<P>
   David Morse and Lucas Black.
</P>
<P>
   An odd mix of civil rights drama and Southern Gothic comedy that
goes down just fine. The movie splits time between the wild
adventures of Lucille (Melanie Griffith), who breaks out of a small
Alabama town and heads West, and a graver story back home. Griffith
does her best work since ``Working Girl.'' Antonio Banderas'
direction throws off some sparks, even if it doesn't fully catch
fire. (SM)1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. Snotty Paris yuppies hold a weekly
dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as a guest. Publisher
Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he meets
Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. Fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back and
is forced to spend the evening with Villeret who systematically
wrecks his life. (ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' R (violent antisocial behavior, sexuality
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton,
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio release, the
Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it
as liking it. Either reaction is justifiable. The film, about a
pack of guys beating each other to bloody pulps, is violent,
nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor. But it's still
one of those rare films that creates an electrifying alternate
universe onscreen. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley
</P>
<P>
   and Jean Smart.
</P>
<P>
   A college grad (Sarah Polley) moves in with a 50-ish bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made a career out of introducing
much younger women to the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But
what sounds like grist for a feminist diatribe against our
culture's wink-wink approval of such liaisons is actually a sweet,
rueful love letter. The writing and direction is sharp as a tack
and the acting is gorgeous. (ERG)1 hour, 47 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon get ``Happy.'' This sunny crowd-pleaser stars Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn as escaped convicts who hide out in a small
town by posing as a gay couple who stage beauty pageants for little
girls. A last-minute plot device is a bad idea, but by then the
picture has built up so much good will you can't help but go along.
The cast is excellent, especially William H. Macy as the sheriff.
(ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Terence Stamp
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   A Cockney ex-con (Terence Stamp) comes to L.A. to avenge the
supposedly accidental death of his daughter. He hones in on a slimy
record producer (Peter Fonda). Plotwise, this is a revenge movie,
but thematically, it's an off-beat meditation on the nature of
Hollywood, especially what's left of '60s Hollywood as it demands
attention from an increasingly disinterested '90s Hollywood. Both
stars are superb. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Life So Far'' PG-13 (sexual content and nude pictures)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Colin Firth,
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
</P>
<P>
   and Irene Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   If this story of a 10-year-old boy and his family had emotional
charge to match its gorgeous Scottish scenery, it could be a small
classic. But under the pretty-but-prim direction of Hugh Hudson
(``Chariots of Fire''), it's not much more than a twee highland
travelogue. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A meandering mystery/drama/romance that never hits the right
groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin Scott Thomas a
congresswoman who discover their spouses, both killed in a plane
crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing romance never taps
beneath the surface. (SM)2 hours, 11 minutes. C-

<P>
   ``Romance'' Unrated, but there is sex, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   bondage and a rape.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Caroline Ducey.
</P>
<P>
   A dull little French film with an undeserved ``hot'' reputation.
Upset because her boyfriend has stopped having sex with her, Marie
(Caroline Ducey) starts having lots of sex. Rough sex,
indiscriminate sex, quickie sex. Even bondage sex with her boss who
takes about an hour to tie her up (guess they don't have Boy Scouts
in France). The movie is very explicit and absolutely unerotic. In
French with subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 36 minutes. D

</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino)

   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG)1 hour, 42 minutes. C-

<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 38 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   Whaddya know _ a ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer
that doesn't bite. As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary
Katherine Gallagher, Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of
adolescent brazenness and self-mortification. It's clear Shannon
loves this character, but she's never afraid to push the envelope
of outrageousness, whether talking baby talk to her breasts, or
fantasizing that a tree is her lover. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality)

<P>
   Starring George Clooney,

<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's
stolen Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 51 minutes. B

<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry,

<P>
   Neve Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   A perfectly pleasant extended sitcom trumped up with TV stars
and begging for bellylaughs. Matthew Perry (``Friends'') headlines
this mostly slapstick, throwaway love story about Oscar Novack, a
heterosexual Chicago architect who everybody thinks is gay. The
comedy is mostly a physical joke: spastic running, tripping over
coat trees, accidental pokes in the crotch and just plain barfing.

<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    Exploring the saga of an often misunderstood people
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 24
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who sent the first Spanish astronaut into space? The Basques, of
course. Blew that sucker right over the top of a building.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Luis Carrero Blanco wasn't a space pioneer, but the No. 2
honcho of fascist dictator Francisco Franco. His unfortunate
liftoff occurred Dec. 20, 1973. On his way to morning Mass, he
pulled his car into its usual spot and ignited a 165-pound stash of
dynamite planted by the Basque terrorist group known as the ETA. It
was the sort of crime that ensured the Basques would be enshrined
in the world psyche as a bunch of bloodthirsty, beret-wearing
hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Mark Kurlansky's ``The Basque History of the World''
makes a persuasive case that the Basques are anything but rude,
crude and lewd. Speakers of Euskera, Europe's oldest living
language, an arcane mixture of k's and x's that some say was used
by Adam and Eve and others claim caused the clamor at Babel, this
mysterious, long-lobed clan has variously been described as Celts,
Etruscans, the lost tribe of Israel, survivors of Atlantis and
direct descendants of Tubal, Noah's grandson. The Basques built the
strongest ships and caught the most whales, so naturally their
salt-of-the-earth, saltwater tales make riveting reading. The
Basque mystique, c'est chic.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurlansky's prime concern is to correct the onerous
propaganda that has dogged this fascinating civilization. To this
end, Kurlansky _ whose ``Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed
the World'' won a James Beard Award last year _ succeeds
handsomely. A rich mix of mythos and reportage, history and
anecdote, literature and etymology, culinary lore and recipes, it
may be the most important English work on Iberia since Robert
Hughes' ``Barcelona.'' Rigorously researched and accessibly told,
this Food &AMP; Wine columnist's effort ought to do for the Basques
what the Time magazine art critic's long-winded art history did for
the Catalans. It's as de rigueur as a visit to the Basque-built
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao was a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Basques seem to be a mythical people, almost an imagined
people,'' Kurlansky says in the opening pages. ``Their ancient
culture is filled with undated legends and customs. Their land
itself, a world of red-roofed, whitewashed towns, tough green
mountains, rocky crests, a cobalt sea that turns charcoal in stormy
weather, a strange language, and big berets, exists on no maps
except their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than New Hampshire, Basqueland consists of three French
and four Spanish provinces that straddle the Pyrenees. Spiritually,
it has been held together by nothing more than its agglutinating
language, which, even after a post-Franco renaissance, is spoken by
only about 1 million people. The word ``honcho,'' or jauntxo, by
the way, is one of the few Basque words that has seeped into
English.
</P>
<P>
   From pil pil to the espadrille, the Basque contribution has been
significant, albeit little known.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of us learned in the sixth grade that Magellan was
the first person to circumnavigate the globe, he was actually
killed in the Philippines, leaving Juan Sebastian de Elcano, a
Basque commander, to complete the journey in 1522. Perhaps the most
famous Basque was Ignatius Loyola, who founded the Jesuit order in
1534. During the age of discovery, the Basques were among the
earliest Europeans to reach the Americas and Asia. They were the
first whale hunters and the first Europeans to grow tobacco, and
from the Americas they brought corn, beans, chile peppers and
chocolate to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kurlansky, who caught the Basque bug while working as a reporter
for the International Herald Tribune in the 1970s, writes with
brevity, elegance and vivid imagery (Basque singers have
``chocolaty basses''). Alas, there are a few minor bumps. His
defense of the Basques can be strident and one-sided. While the
Spanish were nothing if not hypocritical, the truth is that both
sides committed crimes. As a storyteller, he sometimes interrupts
the flow by placing the reader inside, say, a war survivor's home
without giving a signal that the scene has changed. But as a
culinary historian, he's nearly peerless.
</P>
<P>
   How delicious to discover that the salt cod dish known as pil
pil was the result of a telegraphic error. In 1836, a Bilbao
merchant ordered ``100 or 120 top-quality salt cod,'' but it came
out on the other end as ``1,000,120.'' Yipes! With so much cod,
just a bit of olive oil and garlic and a technique in which the
fish is swirled over a flame in an earthen casserole, a lovely
sauce was born.
</P>
<P>
   And not since Edna Lewis' ``The Taste of Country Cooking'' has
hog killing been rendered so poetically. Before the women put the
sausage in the pot, they cross themselves, hoping the casings won't
break.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long goodbye for Pepe the pig: ``The men sat at the long
table, where crusty bread and bottles of Rioja wine had been
placed. ... First, porrusalda, a hot leek and potato soup, was
served, followed by salt cod and red pepper salad with slices of
garlic in olive oil. Then came slices of Pepe's grilled liver,
followed by grilled sliced fillet of victim, and then brazo gitano,
a custard-filled sponge cake. Then coffee, brandy, Cuban cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus having filled us with history in its most palatable form,
Kurlansky leaves us to bask with the Basques.

 &HT;    Under the spell of Herman Melville
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Sena Jeter Naslund was 12 when she slipped a heavy
volume from the Birmingham Public Library shelf and read the
opening line, ``Call me Ishmael.'' From that moment, she was hooked
on Herman Melville. While her friends lay in bed reading Nancy Drew
mysteries, Naslund avidly followed the tragic voyage of Captain
Ahab in ``Moby-Dick,'' falling in love with an ocean she would not
see until she was 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two things that appealed to me when I was 12,''
Naslund, 57, says after reading to a packed auditorium recently at
the Southern Festival of Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was the grand figure of Ahab and his profound searching. I
knew he was grand, and I knew he was doomed, and I wanted to
understand how those two things might exist in a single person. The
other thing that appealed to me was the ocean descriptions, the
beauty of the language.''
</P>
<P>
   What irked her, though, was the lack of female characters. So,
four decades later, after listening to a books-on-tape version of
``Moby-Dick'' with her 10-year-old daughter, Naslund determined to
tell the stories that Melville left out in an epic tale of her own.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Ahab's Wife'' (Morrow, $28), a critically
acclaimed novel that has become the literary event of the season.
William Morrow paid more than a half-million dollars for the book
in a bidding war, the Book-of-the-Month Club chose it as a main
selection, and reviewers from Time magazine's Pico Iyer to author
Wally Lamb have praised the writing with such phrases as ``lush and
luminous.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the intriguing line, ``Captain Ahab was neither
my first husband nor my last,'' the novel traces the life of Una
Spenser, a spirited 19th-century heroine who, at 16, disguises
herself as a boy and joins a whaling crew. Other adventures follow
as Una crosses paths with real people such as writer Margaret
Fuller and astronomer Maria Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used historical figures because I didn't want anyone to be
able to say that Una was an unlikely character of her time,''
Naslund says. ``So two of her best friends are Margaret Fuller and
Maria Mitchell. The stuff about them is carefully researched.
Mitchell, for example, tells Una that she wears only silks because
cotton rests on the slave trade, and she won't support that in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in Margaret Fuller's book, `Women in the 19th Century,'
she writes, `Let them be sea captains if they will.' That's the
attitude of Una. I wanted her to be authentic to her time and yet
speak to our time. Una is on a spiritual quest, and many women have
come up to me and said, `Thank you for writing this book.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Naslund, Paul Bresnick, the editor at Morrow who
handled her manuscript, was a Melville devotee who reads
``Moby-Dick'' aloud to friends once a year. Bresnick was dubious at
first, but then he read the opening sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely enthralled,'' Bresnick says. ``I took it home
with me on Thanksgiving weekend and I had to be dragged kicking and
screaming to the turkey dinner. I was struck by how thoroughly she
has imbued the spirit of Herman Melville and how it permeates every
page of her book. But one need not have read `Moby-Dick' to
appreciate this novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Naslund says she did meticulous research to make sure all the
details were accurate. She read biographies of Melville and books
about the weather on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also went to Mystic, Conn., where they have a whaler. I had
already written the whaling sequence by then, and I was delighted
to find the ship exactly as I had envisioned it. And visiting Old
Sturbridge (Village in Massachusetts) and Mystic gave me an insight
into what everyday life was like. I learned about the way they
cooked, the furniture they sat on and their gardens. They have
heirloom gardens with authentic 19th-century plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Naslund's interest in storytelling is rooted in her childhood in
Birmingham. The daughter of a pianist mother and a doctor father,
Naslund began writing when she was barely 5. ``I wrote newspapers
for Cowboy Town,'' she says, laughing. ``There were robberies and
runaway horses and stampedes. The books I read growing up, such as
the Laura Ingalls Wilder (books), emphasized strong women. I also
read a lot of Dickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Naslund's creativity extended to the playground as well, says
Nancy Brooks Moore, who lives in Atlanta. ``She made up characters
for us to play and sometimes we'd pretend to be detectives and hide
in the rafters at the bus station. We were always getting into
fights with boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Naslund's reading taste ran to the literary, Moore
says. ``I was reading Nancy Drew and she was reading Dickens when
she was 9 or 10. She always wanted a Dickens book for her
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Birmingham-Southern College and earning a
doctorate at the University of Iowa Writers Workshop, Naslund
landed at the University of Louisville. Married to her third
husband, physicist John C. Morrison, Naslund teaches creative
writing and edits the Louisville Review, which she founded in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she has written two short story collections and two
other novels, including ``Sherlock in Love,'' in which she created
a romantic interest for the famous detective.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a 36-city book tour, Naslund is looking forward
to resuming work on her next book, a novel about race relations set
in Birmingham in the late 1950s and early '60s. As for the future,
Naslund intends to heed the words of Ishmael in ``Ahab's Wife''
when Una praises the harpooner's gift as a storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suppose that you yourself have a story to tell,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed she does.
</P>
<P>
   Sena Jeter Naslund will read from her novel at 8:15 tonight at
Emory University's White Hall, Room 207. A book signing will
follow. 480 Kilgo Road. 404-325-1505.

 &HT;    Virtues, vices of journalism and academia
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 24
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This particular book happened to be a biography of a certain
American president. With some argument we allowed that there was
this to be said for it and this to be said against it, but we
agreed on its essential worth with damning finality: ``Fascinating
but journalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   That said quite enough and we moved on, self-satisfied in not
letting sober judgment be debased by cheap thrills. There were
three of us: an academic, a journalist, and a man happy to be
neither fish nor fowl.
</P>
<P>
   What called us collegially together was a prize of considerable
note, but it was the temperaments we brought to the table that
pigeonholed us as much as where we hung our hats. Half an hour
earlier, a different book had been chewed on and sent on its way
just as summarily: ``Solid but academic.'' In short, a book you
might need to refer to one day but never read.
</P>
<P>
   There is something weasly about the two words: ``journalistic''
and ``academic.'' As everyday adjectives, they serve most
frequently as slurs and slights. Yet they imply settled habits of
mind and standards of judgment. They mark off mutually inhospitable
spheres of influence, a strange thing when you consider their
incestuous ancestry. You'd think they were opposite poles, each
with its own magnetic field. What is journalistic by definition
could not be academic; and what is academic had better not be in
the least journalistic if someone's looking to get tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you think journalism and scholarship honest professions
or just two more lines of work, there is a long tradition of
apostates and converts in both. Walter Lippmann went to Harvard
intending to become a professor of philosophy _ he was William
James' favorite student. George Will very much was a professor of
philosophy. There are always, of course, those who manage to work
both sides of the street. But you get the point.
</P>
<P>
   A writer may be serious or he may be trivial, but it is more
important to know whether he is a ``journalist'' or an
``academic.'' The issue is more than simply taxonomic. The species
now and then intermingle, and they each have their quadroons and
their mutants. But the labels stick. They tell, usually, more about
the labeler than the labeled. Which is why they are usually uttered
with telling intonation. ``Journalistic'' requires a prideful
sneer, ``academic'' a pitying chuckle. I am practiced at both, as a
matter of fact, and at different times have employed each as
survival demanded.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to think I use ``academic'' without libelous intent,
but let others judge. What I am certain of is that the two worlds _
journalism and the academy _ feed on their uneasy coexistence. I
think they actually enjoy it. It enables them to define themselves
by reference to what they are not. Vices found in another easily
testify to imagined virtues in ourselves. David Eisenhower is not,
ordinarily speaking, an unimpeachable witness. He wanted to be a
newspaperman when he was young and won an internship with the old
Philadelphia Bulletin. ``Journalists,'' he said after it was
finished, ``are not as interesting as they think they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The words sting, and yet I have known journalists dull as any
Republican. Even more surprising, I have caught in an academic the
occasional glint of what I think may have been wit _ it's hard to
tell against the academy's protective coloring.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, generalizations suggest themselves. There does
seem to be a kind of temperament that inclines one person toward
scholarship and another toward newspapering. Unless my experience
is grossly distorted, one difference is this: Many an academic in
the humanities is inclined inward rather than outward, and tills a
small patch of soil over and over while the world moves on without
his notice. A journalist by instinct looks outward to the world's
variety and change. He may have enough of a reflective sense to
seek out the past in the present and the future in both, but the
important point is that his perspective will be fluid, shifting
with the flow of events.
</P>
<P>
   These differences are scandalously sketchy and they are not
universally the case, but where they exist you are apt to find
others as well: The first-rate scholar is the more patient sifter
of evidence, with a broader sense of proportion. He is literate
rather than glib. The second-rate scholar is only a plodder, a
putter-to-sleep, a grubber of footnotes. His instinct is to seek
out the abstract, thinking it impressive, when what matters is the
concrete. I've known many who were first-rate, and many more who
were second-rate and did not know it.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist can have all these failings, but the good one has a
taste for the pith of human endeavor and is quicker to spot in the
passing moment what is of intrinsic interest. He can, on the other
hand, be nothing more than a trafficker in the transient and the
trivial, with all the depth of a thimble.
</P>
<P>
   If I am unfair in this, I owe apologies near and far. The first
would be to a biographer whose book I thought entirely fascinating,
journalistic or not. For him, unfortunately, the question was more
than academic.

 &HT;    Director Soderbergh's distinct style keeps him from boredom
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 10 years since he became an international sensation with
``sex, lies, and videotape,'' director Steven Soderbergh has been
working in Hollywood. But he's never exactly gone Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Even in mainstream films like his ``Out of Sight,'' the
Atlanta-born, Louisiana-bred filmmaker has sustained an edgy,
personal tone that distinguishes all his work. His latest, ``The
Limey,'' let him work with two '60s icons, Terence Stamp, as a
veteran British thief named Wilson who flies to L.A. to avenge the
death of his daughter, and Peter Fonda as the rich record producer
who may be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really inspiring,'' says Soderbergh, now 36.
``They've gone through a lot and kept their soul intact and are
happy to get up and go to work in the morning. I just thought,
`Wow, I hope I still have that spark when I'm that age' _ 'cause
it's hard. This business will beat it out of you if you're not
careful.'' (Maybe that's one reason he plans to relocate from Los
Angeles to New York next year.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Limey,'' Soderbergh tells the streamlined story with a
tricky, time-shifting style, using stutter-cuts and surprise
editing to give Lem Dobbs' script texture. Anyone who saw his 1998
heist flick ``Out of Sight'' will recognize the technique. He used
it to its strongest effect in a scene between its stars, George
Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, which was shot in multiple locations,
including a cocktail lounge and a hotel bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens in a scene between Stamp and Lesley Ann
Warren in ``Limey,'' a single conversation that Soderbergh shot in
three locations, then edited together. ``It's amazing to me how
easily it goes down with people, because it makes no sense
logically,'' he admits. ``But I think they understand on some level
that the whole film is a memory piece. It's like someone saying, `I
had this long conversation with this woman. We went walking and had
something to eat, and I don't remember where we were when she said
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   However distinct the style is, he's putting it aside for a
while. ``Not that there isn't more room to explore that sort of
fragmented narrative style, but I'm gonna drop that for a while,''
he says, calling from a Los Angeles editing room, where he's
putting together his next film _ one he says will make us
reconsider Julia Roberts as an actress, more than just a movie
star. (More about that later.)
</P>
<P>
   On top of its editing tricks, ``The Limey'' has a built-in depth
charge. Soderbergh bought the rights to the 1967 Ken Loach film
``Poor Cow,'' starring Stamp, and he uses footage from it as
flashback shots of Wilson. At first, you may think you're watching
a young actor who looks very much like Stamp. ``It's pretty
amazing,'' Soderbergh says. ``You can hear the ripple in the
audience when they realize, No, that's really him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other directors, Soderbergh rarely repeats himself,
stretching his range from period drama (``King of the Hill'') to
surreal larks (``Kafka,'' ``Schizopolis'') to film noir
(``Underneath'') to staged performance (Spalding Gray's one-man
show ``Gray's Anatomy''). ``I'm restless, personally,'' he says.
``I get bored with the idea of doing the same thing again and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' was his first big studio film, and while it
made many critics' Top 10 lists, it suffered by being released in
the summer against flashier movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a good experience; I was pretty happy with it,''
he says now. ``Do I think the studio should've put it out in the
fall when they were originally supposed to? Yeah, if we had come
out in October, I think we could've had a big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe next time. The movie he's editing now is ``Erin
Brokovich,'' the fact-based drama about a single mother working for
a law firm, who uncovers information about a major
gas-and-electricity utility implicated in multiple illnesses in a
small community.
</P>
<P>
   ```Working-class' would be the polite term,'' Soderbergh says of
the character Roberts plays. ``And Julia was so inside the
character. She's amazing in the movie. I told her, `Your problem is
going to be following this, because you've reached a whole other
place now, and you can't go back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to sum up his career after being a moviemaker for 10
years, he pauses a moment, then says, ``I just hope that I can keep
getting better. Only recently do I feel that I'm starting to
understand what I'm doing. I still feel my best work is in front of
me.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like runners in a relay race, one low-pressure system near the
northern Great Lakes will transfer its jet stream support to
another low developing off the Carolina coast Friday. In between,
there will be a shrinking ridge of pleasant, bright weather.
Meanwhile, high pressure retreating into the Canadian Maritimes
will cause a moist onshore flow in New England bringing ocean
clouds inland.
</P>
<P>
   Intense low pressure moving east across Ontario will direct a
strong cold front toward the Appalachians. A band of gusty showers
will mark the northern section of the front from Ohio into western
New York. Brisk winds from the northwest will drive very cold air
across the western Great Lakes causing rain showers in Michigan and
Wisconsin. Snow will accumulate in the upper peninsula of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny, mild weather will dominate the South and much of the
Southeast. A storm developing east of Cape Hatteras will keep some
clouds near the coast. These clouds will eventually be drawn into
the Middle Atlantic states and Northeast as the front in the Ohio
Valley approaches.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from Saskatchewan to Utah will control
conditions over the West. Its clockwise circulation will draw
cooler, dry air into the central and southern Plains. Winds from
the east will bring desert dryness to most of California. Patches
of cirrus clouds and coastal fog may dull the weather along the
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Jose may gain strength again Friday as the
shearing winds lessen over the storm. It should take a decisive
turn to the north by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SHEARED JOSE
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Jose was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday as
strong, upper-level winds sheared off the tops of thunderstorms
around its core. Inside thunderstorms surrounding a hurricane's
eye, massive amounts of heat are given off as water vapor in rising
air condenses into cloud drops. This release of heat makes the air
buoyant, allowing it to rise to great altitudes. At its apex, some
air sinks into the eye and warms on descent, lowering air density
and, in turn, surface pressure, which leads to intensification.
When thunderstorm tops are sheared off, however, the hurricane
weakens.

 &HT;    CONGRESS URGED TO FUND PROTECTIONS FOR CORAL REEFS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress has not earmarked enough money to protect
endangered coral reefs in American waters, a Commerce Department
official warned lawmakers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A $37 billion spending bill approved by both houses late
Wednesday contains $2 million for coral reef conservation and
restoration. President Clinton had requested $12 million. The
president has indicated he will veto the bill, which finances the
operations of the Commerce, State and Justice departments, because
of disagreements primarily over the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced appropriation means the government won't be able to
implement the recommendations of a presidential task force to map
and monitor coral reefs and create coral reef reserves, said Sally
Yozell, deputy assistant secretary for oceans and atmosphere for
the Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lack a comprehensive federal program to map, monitor,
protect, manage and restore the nation's coral reefs,'' Yozell told
the House subcommittee on fisheries conservation, wildlife and
oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Yozell and local conservationists urged the panel to pass a bill
that would allocate $10 million a year for the next five years for
a grant program. The bill, sponsored by subcommittee chairman Jim
Saxton, R-N.J., would also require the government to provide
matching money for non-governmental projects to encourage state and
local involvement in the efforts to conserve coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to preserve the Florida Keys coral reef system, the
third largest in the world, could have major economic implications
for Florida, said John Ogden, director of the Florida Institute of
Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reefs are important to economies. U.S. coral reef ecosystems
in Hawaii and the Florida Keys alone produce more than $2 billion
annually,'' Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that better management was needed in order to
sustain coral reefs and recommended implementing more effective
zoning laws to protect reefs from human destruction. Ogden also
stressed the need for long-term research and assessment of coral
reefs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the world's coral reefs are being
degraded or destroyed, the panel was told.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental factors and human activities are responsible for
the poor health of coral reefs and the marine ecosystems they
support, Yozell said.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton added, ``These reefs provide essential habitat for
hundreds of commercial and recreational fish species, and they
support tourism that is the economic backbone of many coastal
communities. This bill is really only the first step.''

 &HT;    SMALL DEVICE DETECTS TRACES OF DRUGS, EXPLOSIVES AND CHEMICALS,
MAKER SAYS
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new hand-held device that the manufacturer says will detect
trace residue from explosives, narcotics or chemical weapons was
unveiled on Thursday in the fight the war against drugs and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately the size of a hand-held vacuum cleaner, the
IONSCAN Sabre2000 was designed by the New Jersey-based Barringer
Technologies, Inc., to detect the smallest of physical particles
and the faintest of vapors.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement, customs, security officials and school
administrators can use the device rather easily in a variety of
ways, said Ken Wood, Barrringer's president.
</P>
<P>
   The machine works when a swab of paper with trace residue is
inserted into the machine for a reading, which takes about 20
seconds. Barringer spokespersons said officials then have an idea
of the type of explosives or drugs that have been found, making it
easier for them to assess the potential danger of suspicious
packages or people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the product's features are its mobility and reliability,
Barringer officials said. Even an expert bombmaker will leave trace
residue 95 percent of the time, said Mark Elliott, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Barringer has marketed the machine to airports and national
government agencies, but said it also expected schools to be
interested in the device.
</P>
<P>
   The machine's mobility could allow school administrators to
examine hundreds of lockers, possible storage units for drugs and
explosives, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   He said schools could test the outsides of lockers and, based on
the evidence, either confront the student, open the locker or place
the student under surveillance. Wood said he would recommend
cleaning the locker completely if trace residue is found and then
testing a week later for a more accurate reading.
</P>
<P>
   The device is currently priced at $20,000, but Barringer said
the company is working to make it more affordable, particularly to
state law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabre2000 works much like other detection tools, like
drug-sniffing dogs. But Wood pointed out one advantage of the
device:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs can't tell you what they're sniffing,'' he said.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DOUBLE JEOPARDY,' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a
touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington state
to New Orleans' French Quarter, Ms. Judd plays a woman who is free
to kill her husband because she has already gone to prison for the
crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away
with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her
character becomes less of a victim. In this coed homage to `The
Fugitive,' Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a
knack for barking orders. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it
takes a line like `I feel like I've grown in the last six years' to
signal the passage of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is
1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FIGHT CLUB,' starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena
Bonham Carter. Directed by David Fincher (R, 135 minutes). The
sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of this grunge
parable means to hit raw nerves. Making a tougher but less
stomach-turning film than his earlier `Seven,' Fincher taps into
the nexus of computer-age malevolent fantasy and attempts to
psychoanalyze an entire culture _ in ways that aren't entirely
clear until the film's whammy of a denouement arrives. A reckless
but fascinating attempt, expertly acted, to make sense of
contemporary frustrations (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GUINEVERE,' starring Sarah Polley and Stephen Rea. Written and
directed by Audrey Wells (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Polley shines as a
shy, rebellious 21-year-old involved in an affair with an older
man. Escaping her chilly family, she moves into the well-populated
space beneath the wing of a bohemian photographer, played with
great charm by Rea. This coming-of-age film takes a knowing,
intimate view of the dynamics of such a relationship and watches
its heroine blossom. Ms. Polley blossoms as well, as a luminous,
mysterious young actress capable of exceptionally subtle shadings
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPY, TEXAS,' starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn and William
H. Macy. Directed by Mark Illsley (R, 96 minutes). The zany comedy
follows two escaped convicts ( Northam and Zahn) who pose as a pair
of gay pageant producers in a small Texas town that is grooming its
little girls for the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant. Macy is poignant
as the discreetly gay doe-eyed sheriff who shyly pursues Northam
(who is only posing as gay). Zahn has his amusing moments as an oaf
improvising ludicrous dance routines. But the movie is so desperate
to be liked that its satire is risk-free and toothless, and its
laughs widely scattered (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `JULIEN DONKEY-BOY,' starring Ewen Bremner, Chloe Sevigny and
Werner Herzog. Directed by Harmony Korine (R, 94 minutes). Working
in accordance with the Danish set of directorial strictures known
as Dogma '95, the enfant-terrible director of `Gummo' finds
creative ways to bend the rules. Inventively and kinetically shot,
this film about a schizophrenic is vastly more interesting on its
visual merits than for its hazy, indulgent drama. As the ranting
father of the title character, Herzog goes enthusiastically over
the top. The luminous Ms. Sevigny remains Korine's secret weapon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LIMEY,' starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the
quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome
throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Stamp, in a
stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early
career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his
daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Fonda's slick Hollywood
hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Soderbergh
resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's `Point
Blank' as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from
every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes).
What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and
convicted of war crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious
plan for his escape. Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically
intense as Bogey and Bergman in `Casablanca,' but here the woman is
the one who ends up doing the thinking for both of them (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `RANDOM HEARTS,' starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott
Thomas. Directed by Sydney Pollack (R, 131 minutes). Pollack's
characteristically solid, incisive direction has become a throwback
to the days of subtler movie storytelling. But it still rivets
attention during the first half of this star-crossed romance, which
tells of two people who meet after their spouses die in the same
plane crash. The plot becomes very thick indeed when it develops
that the dead spouses were having an affair, and the survivors fall
into a bittersweet relationship of their own. Ford is taciturnly
forceful, Ms. Scott Thomas a shade too familiar, as
credulity-stretching complications ensue (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROMANCE,' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin, Francois
Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by Catherine
Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes). A solemn, sexually graphic
exploration of the nature of a woman's need for male attention and
erotic love, even if its insights are already familiar to readers
of Cosmopolitan and the Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the
film's intellectual aspects would command the same attention if its
camera did not make the actors' genitals as familiar as their
faces. The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved
the considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often
stilted and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers
between passion and philosophical argument without often achieving
Ms. Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy (
Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist (
Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think `What Dreams May Come' and `Simon Birch'). When you trace
the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STORY OF US,' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Rob Reiner (R, 90 minutes). The first unofficial Jack
Lemmon comedy for the baby boom generation. As an ode to the ups
and downs of middle-aged marriage, this arthritic suburban story is
enough to make single people want to file for divorce. Willis makes
iffy casting in the role of a sensitive father and husband, while
Ms. Pfeiffer is not well served by a role that makes her scream so
hard that her neck turns red. Together, with the help of noisy
friends and acquaintances, these two run through the long history
of a marriage with the help of a criminal set of wigs and
hairpieces. Small talk turns to matters like home repair jobs and
prostate trouble (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY,' starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy
Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least
likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Lynch
rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound
like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a
riding lawnmower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking,
deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall.
And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `STIR OF ECHOES,' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes). Another little boy talks
to a ghost at the start of this thriller, but it isn't an instant
`Sixth Sense' sequel. Instead it shows what happens when the boy's
closed-minded father lets himself be hypnotized and awakens to find
himself receiving otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a grippingly
intense performance as a man terrified by his new extrasensory
powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of what it means to
unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and early momentum, the
film winds up with too earthbound an explanation for the havoc it
unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THREE KINGS,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
The prodigiously talented writer-director of `Spanking the Monkey'
and `Flirting With Disaster' has made a much more ambitious film,
with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf war film has a
`Catch-22' absurdist edge, but it also has an oversupply of visual
affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera tricks jazz up the
otherwise straightforward story of American soldiers who have
larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured gold and then
develop conscience pangs about their own roles in Iraq. There are
many clever peripheral touches, but there's something tamely
conventional at the film's core (Maslin).

 &HT;    SMALL DEVICE DETECTS TRACES OF DRUGS, EXPLOSIVES AND CHEMICALS,
MAKER SAYS
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new hand-held device that the manufacturer says will detect
trace residue from explosives, narcotics or chemical weapons was
unveiled on Thursday in the fight the war against drugs and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately the size of a hand-held vacuum cleaner, the
IONSCAN Sabre2000 was designed by the New Jersey-based Barringer
Technologies, Inc., to detect the smallest of physical particles
and the faintest of vapors.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement, customs, security officials and school
administrators can use the device rather easily in a variety of
ways, said Ken Wood, Barrringer's president.
</P>
<P>
   The machine works when a swab of paper with trace residue is
inserted into the machine for a reading, which takes about 20
seconds. Barringer spokespersons said officials then have an idea
of the type of explosives or drugs that have been found, making it
easier for them to assess the potential danger of suspicious
packages or people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the product's features are its mobility and reliability,
Barringer officials said. Even an expert bombmaker will leave trace
residue 95 percent of the time, said Mark Elliott, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Barringer has marketed the machine to airports and national
government agencies, but said it also expected schools to be
interested in the device.
</P>
<P>
   The machine's mobility could allow school administrators to
examine hundreds of lockers, possible storage units for drugs and
explosives, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   He said schools could test the outsides of lockers and, based on
the evidence, either confront the student, open the locker or place
the student under surveillance. Wood said he would recommend
cleaning the locker completely if trace residue is found and then
testing a week later for a more accurate reading.
</P>
<P>
   The device is currently priced at $20,000, but Barringer said
the company is working to make it more affordable, particularly to
state law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabre2000 works much like other detection tools, like
drug-sniffing dogs. But Wood pointed out one advantage of the
device:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs can't tell you what they're sniffing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The reinstallation of a museum's permanent collection
may sound like a routine affair, pulled together in caffeine-fueled
sessions of wall painting and heavy lifting. But it takes at least
as much brain power as muscle to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of thinking has clearly gone into the splendidly revamped
ancient Near Eastern galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
As a result, a group of stellar, although under-visited objects has
been awarded a persuasive showcase, and more than 8,000 years'
worth of art has been coaxed into a semblance of historical logic.
</P>
<P>
   A few basics about the ancient Near East are good to understand.
Along with Egypt, this region produced one of the first great
historical civilizations. And its defining parameters are crazily
broad. In time they run from a Neolithic date of around 5000 B.C.
to the Islamic Conquest of the seventh century A.D., and
geographically from India to the Mediterranean, and from the
Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   It is also useful to know how much we do not know about the
dozens of cultures that fall within that framework. Some, like
those of Assyria and Achaeminid Persia, made a very loud noise for
a long time. Others passed like strangers in the night, without
leaving so much as a whisper of their identities behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to realize is how beautiful this art is
and, despite its breadth, how much of a piece. Incised ivory
plaques, tissue-thin gold jewelry, colossal stone sculptures and
action-packed, micro-miniature cylinder seals may have been created
thousands of years and thousands of miles apart. But they are
linked by themes and styles that make Near Eastern art a
descriptively viable term.
</P>
<P>
   It is viable, however, only after intensive shaping and sorting.
And this is what it gets at the hands of Prudence O. Harper and
Joan Aruz, the curators of the new installation, who shrewdly
alternate moments of big-gun flair with an overall jigsaw-puzzle
ingenuity to insure as complete a picture as possible. The
arrangement is roughly chronological. Broad geographical shifts _
from Mesopotamia to Iran, for example _ are marked by changes in
wall color. In each major section outstanding objects are clustered
in the center of the gallery, serving as lures and as guideposts to
what lies beyond.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic sights comes toward the beginning, out
of historical sequence, in the Assyrian gallery just off the Great
Hall balcony. This once-gloomy enclosure has been opened up to
natural light from above, and its walls are lined with an imposing
series of the limestone panels that once adorned the audience hall
of king Ashurasirpal II (reigned 883-859 B.C.) at his northern
Mesopotamian palace at Nimrud.
</P>
<P>
   Two 10-foot-tall carved winged creatures with staring human
faces _ one with the body of a lion, the other of a bull _ flank a
doorway. The panels themselves depict figures in low relief. Some
are human, as in the case of the king depicted with dangle earrings
and what looks like a fancy clip-on beard. Others, like an
eagle-headed beast with a powerhouse man's physique, are fantastic,
even monstrous.
</P>
<P>
   Assyrian art is about winning through intimidation. The carved
narrative reliefs from Nimrud _ a selection of them visited New
York from the British Museum in 1995, but none are on view here _
obsessively dwell on hair-raising battles and sadistic wildlife
hunts. The half-human raptor in the Met frieze was intended to
advertise the aggressive otherwordly resources the king could
command.
</P>
<P>
   Like most official art, these images adhere to a formula, but
seen in isolation their stylized virtuosity stands out. The fringe
of the bird-man's robe and the bulging calf of his leg are
delicately executed. His ramrod pose has a courtly grace. In one
hand he carries a purse-size bucket of holy water; in the other he
dabs the air with a fruit that looks like a pine cone, as if
removing a pesky stain from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The formal ingredients of Assyrian art can be traced to other
Mesopotamian sculpture, early and late. The stiff stance and
spellbound eyes occur in the figure of a Sumerian temple worshiper
from the the third millennium B.C. The tendency to invest spiritual
power in animal forms persists in the polychrome glazed brick
reliefs of snarling lions that lined the route to Nebuchadnezzar's
palace in Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one ruler, the Sumerian king named Gudea, who lived
around 2100 B.C, chose to present himself in a fairly benign light
in a series of seated portraits that are among the best known of
ancient Near Eastern sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   In the Met's statue, which is the only one of its kind in the
United States, he is a clean-shaven youth with tapering fingers and
slender toes, and a large head fitted with an outsize pillbox
crown. His face is serene and alert, but his shoulders are slightly
hunched, and one bare arm is flexed. Everything about him is
tensed, as if he is holding his breath. Joining him in the
gallery's celebrity circle is another self-possessed personage, in
the form of a cast-copper head of a bearded man.
</P>
<P>
   Life size and weathered to a frosty green patina, the face bears
tiny asymmetries and fleshy swells of a true likeness. But no one
has any idea who he is, and although he turned up in central or
northwestern Iran, his true place of origin is debated. Wherever he
hails from, he is one of the museum's front-rank attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Iran itself was, along with Mesopotamia, a seedbed of Near
Eastern art, and its eclectic cultural history is amply represented
here. A third millennium terra cotta jar is one of the earliest
pieces, painted with a trio of ibexes in silhouette. Nearby is the
silver figure of a kneeling bull wrapped in a tight sheath skirt,
probably made around 2900 B.C. in the kingdom of Elam, on the
border of Mesopotamia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The entire installation concludes with another knockout silver
sculpture, this one the masklike head of a Sasanian king from the
fourth century A.D. Wearing a crown that swells like an onion dome,
he stares with mesmerized eyes straight out the gallery door toward
the museum's Islamic wing, where the story of Near Eastern art
after the Arab conquest continues.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that earth-shaking event, however, the Near East had
already been the scene of countless incursions, and exchanges. And
Ms. Harper and Ms. Aruz further enrich an already complicated
picture by folding several of these episodes into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Egyptian art, for example, appears in sculpture
from distant Anatolia. The spirit of Greece and Rome lives on in
frescoes from Syria and in a charming terra cotta head from a
Buddhist site in Pakistan. From Spain comes a set of Phoenecian
ivory plaques, now owned by the Hispanic Society of America, among
several borrowed works in the galleries. And a fascinating handful
of items _ a shriveled leather boot, a nude male divinity carved in
wood _ are in New York on long-term loan from the Academy of
Sciences in Tajikistan, a former Soviet territory near the Chinese
border.
</P>
<P>
   Is the total picture a coherent one? Of course not. Culture is
an ungovernable thing, a series of flukish successes and failures
and slow fades, all of which are played out here. It is also a
network of fertile marriages, and they are evident, too. The Near
East collection provides a natural jumping-off point for visits to
the museum's permanent Indian and Islamic displays, not to mention
the magnificent ``Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids''
exhibition, on view through Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Or one may prefer to linger in the refurbished galleries
themselves, where many of those traditions connect and where,
thanks to the Met's careful planning, one can survey them from
fresh perspectives and in first-class style.
</P>
<P>
   The reinstallation of the permanent collection in the Ancient
Near Eastern galleries is on view at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710.

   A Paramedic With a Pen
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Joe Connelly's father was a Greyhound bus driver,
and his mother was a nurse. ``I ended up doing the exact same thing
as my parents, a combination of both,'' said Connelly, left, who
was a paramedic and worked for nine years at St. Clare's Hospital
and Health Center in Manhattan. On the day his autobiographical
novel ``Bringing Out the Dead'' was optioned for a film by the
producer Scott Rudin, Connelly quit the job that had consumed his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times you wondered if you've become as crazy as
what you're seeing,'' said Connelly, whose book is the basis for
the new Martin Scorsese film ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' which opens
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Paul Schrader, the film stars Nicolas Cage as a
paramedic, following him over two days and three nights in the
early 1990s in New York. It tracks the Cage character to the brink
of collapse, as he is engulfed in a world of the dead and dying: a
world that is sometimes horrifying, sometimes funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst parts, for me, were the long stretches when nothing
seemed to be going right,'' said Connelly, who recently moved from
the Upper West Side to an apartment in Washington Heights in upper
Manhattan with his wife and 2-year-old son. ``You're always waiting
for that good call to pull you out of it. When you're saving
somebody's life, that's the greatest high in the world. Better than
drugs, better than anything. When you start to lose people, that's
despair. That sticks to you. That's what I call being stuck at 4
o'clock in the morning in Times Square all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, like the film, is set in Hell's Kitchen, not far from
the Times Square area where Connelly often worked. Times Square had
not yet been rehabilitated, there were drug wars, and the crack and
AIDS epidemics were at their peaks. ``It was a wild time then,''
Connelly said. ``The system was a shambles, the pay was terrible,
the turnover outrageous. You were trying to shut down the stress in
your life. I had a partner who was buying crack on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those novelists who complain bitterly about film
adaptations of their books (but cash the studio checks anyway),
Connelly, who was a technical consultant on the set, said he was a
bit overwhelmed at the movie's faithfulness to the book. ``Paul
Schrader used most of my dialogue,'' he said. ``I can actually
listen to people laugh and respond.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Scorsese also picked up every nuance of the book. ``What
happens as a paramedic is you don't know what's going to happen
next,'' Connelly said. ``Anything's possible. Anything's real.
Nothing makes sense. The character in this movie becomes a mirror
for the suffering he sees. With each day, he's dying a little bit
more. He can't help it. And he's waiting for that one call to bring
him out of it. He's a spiritual figure. And that's what Marty
Scorsese picks up on. And I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, 35, grew up in Queens, and Warwick, N.Y. He was
majoring in philosophy at Colgate University but dropped out after
three years. (``The cause was drunkenness and confusion,'' he
said.) For a year he traveled around the United States doing odd
jobs; he was even a bartender in Ireland for a while. When he
returned to New York, he worked first as an emergency medical
technician at Metropolitan Hospital Center in Harlem, then as a
paramedic at St. Clare's.
</P>
<P>
   He was still working on the late shift when he began writing
about his experiences. At the same time Connelly took a writing
course at Columbia University and met Colin Harrison, deputy editor
of Harper's magazine and a novelist. Harrison was so impressed with
Connelly's work that he found him an agent, who sold the book to
Knopf in 1996. A year later Rudin optioned the book, still in
galleys, for a Paramount film. The book was published in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly is now in the thick of another novel, ``Crumb Town,''
about a man whose life story is turned into a television movie,
which turns into a bleak experience. ``Very much unlike me,'' he
said. ``This film gave me the opportunity to commit myself to
writing full time, have a family and feed them. And I've worked
with some great artists on this film. I'm very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Weddings and Lineage
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm D. Lee makes no effort to hide the reason he wrote and
directed ``The Best Man,'' a romantic comedy that opens on Friday.
``Quite honestly, I wanted to write a script that I thought I could
sell,'' said Lee, 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen that wedding films did very well at the box office;
look at `Four Weddings and a Funeral' and `My Best Friend's
Wedding,''' said Lee. ``I saw that films about middle-class
African-Americans, like `Soul Food' and `Waiting to Exhale,' could
be profitable. A wedding film about African-Americans was, I
thought, overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lee sat down in his New York apartment and wrote ``The Best
Man,'' about a group of successful college friends who are reunited
for a wedding. The fact that the film's cast is almost entirely
African-American, like Lee, lends another dimension to the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just tired of not seeing people I could relate to on the
big screen,'' said Lee, whose cousin, Spike Lee, was the movie's
producer. ``In too many movies the black characters are
marginalized and stereotypical: the black friend who imparts wisdom
to his white co-star, the black prostitute, the thug, the sidekick.
They tend to be one-dimensional. I wanted to go beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low-budget film, which cost about $9 million to
make, stars Taye Diggs (``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'') as the
best man whose steamy novel about his friends throws the wedding
into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to tell a story that was close to my own
experience _ about people who have been to college, people who are
pursuing careers and getting on with their lives,'' Lee said.
Besides, he said, ``people love to see folks getting married _ it
makes everyone feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It helps, of course, that Spike Lee is his cousin. The
well-known filmmaker endorsed Malcolm Lee's proposal that he,
Malcolm, direct the film, even though he was inexperienced. And the
studio making the movie, Universal, signed off on it partly because
of Spike Lee's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But the experienced older director was relatively hands-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike gave advice here and there about casting and the crew,''
Lee said. ``He had some suggestions on how to cut the film down.
But he never second-guessed my instincts. He wanted me to find my
way. And he wasn't around that much. I know he realized that the
director had to have total control.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who now lives in Riverdale in the Bronx, grew up in the
Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. His father is a retired junior
high school teacher, his mother a retired medical records clerk.
From the age of 17, he worked as an assistant on Spike Lee films.
At the same time, he attended Georgetown University and the New
York University film school. Later he won a screenwriting
fellowship at the Walt Disney studios.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said his next film will probably be ``Morningside Prep,''
about black students at a mostly white prep school. He has already
made a short film on the subject. In the meantime, he is nervous
about the current film's opening weekend. ``What we're trying to
say is this is not out of anyone's realm of reality,'' he said.
``Actually, the film has nothing to do with race. It's not a story
about the 'hood. It's a feel-good story about a wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   George as Director
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's life after ``Seinfeld.'' Jason Alexander, forever
known as George Costanza, has directed a new film, ``Just
Looking,'' which is playing Friday at the Hamptons Film Festival
and is searching for a distributor. The film is a comedy about a
14-year-old boy named Lennie from the Bronx who spends a summer in
Queens and develops a crush on an older woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1959 and grew up in Livingston, N.J., but I felt
I knew these people very well,'' said Alexander. ``I read this
script, and I understood this story personally. I'm not a director
to make an action or horror film. That's not for me. This is about
people and relationships, and it appealed to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, produced by Jean Doumanian, has a cast that includes
Patti LuPone and Gretchen Moll. It was written by Marshall Karp.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander rarely sees his ``Seinfeld'' colleagues. ``We don't
communicate that much,'' he said. ``What really bonded us was the
work. And we're really separated by distance. Julia is here and I'm
here and our life situations are similar _ she has two young
children and I have two young children. But when we were making the
show, we were all never really best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Will George Costanza shadow his career? Alexander replied with
an anecdote. Several years ago he met William Shatner, who told him
that for many years he resented the fact that ``Star Trek'' had
left a permanent imprint on his career. ``But then Shatner said he
realized that he had been given something that most actors never
get: the chance to touch people beyond their own life and have a
body of work that he's proud of and will be there after he's
gone,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's how I feel, too.''

<P>
   WARREN, Mich. _ Determined not to be a wallflower at next year's
big parties, General Motors is trying on a rack of new outfits in
an effort to bedazzle those who haven't been asking for a dance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a move unprecedented in the auto industry, GM gave the press
a peek last week at nine so-called concept vehicles that it will
display at the industry's equivalent of debutante balls, the auto
shows in Detroit, Los Angeles, Chicago and Geneva in the first half
of next year. And next week, GM will give journalists a preview of
its glitzy display for the North American International Auto Show
on Jan. 15-23 in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives felt humbled at the 1999 show by an extravagant,
multilevel Ford Motor Co. exhibit that dominated the convention
hall and included products from the company's newly enlarged stable
of international brands. And the Chrysler Corp., now
DaimlerChrysler, has for years staged splashy product introductions
with, literally, rolls of thunder, flashes of lightning and even
minivans that played leapfrog on elaborate sets.
</P>
<P>
   GM, meanwhile, suffered a drought of new products that began
earlier in the decade as serious financial problems brought the
company close to bankruptcy. New car lines were canceled, and at
auto shows GM unveiled relatively few _ and fairly modest _ concept
cars, the vehicles that designers create to show off new ideas or
signal design styling trends.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a healthy balance sheet, GM wants the world to know it
is pumping money into new vehicles and taking some risks.
</P>
<P>
   GM's nine concept vehicles were shown to reporters as
three-dimensional computerized images at the company's virtual
reality design studio here in suburban Detroit. Although the images
looked like real vehicles, they existed only in digital form and
were viewed by wearing special glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cherry, vice president for design and portfolio
development, said at the briefing that GM wanted to be the industry
leader in product innovation, ``and nothing stimulates creativity
more than generating concept vehicles to translate ideas into
forms.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept cars showed styling features specific to each brand
and point to GM's future direction in design. ``All of the concept
vehicles were developed in our advanced concept center, but all are
based on architecture we are looking at for the future or that we
currently use,'' Cherry said.
</P>
<P>
   These are the vehicles GM showed, in the order in which they
will publicly appear:  &QL; 
SATURN CV1  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's first-ever concept vehicle will make its debut at the
Los Angeles auto show on Jan. 8-16. A cross of a minivan, station
wagon and sport utility, the CV1 seats up to seven people,
including two on rear-facing jump seats that fold out of the front
seatbacks. The rear seats also slide and fold to form a flat cargo
floor. There are large windows for a panoramic view, and bi-fold
doors that slide along tracks and can be opened at the front or the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   The CV1 will have an ultra-low-emission four-cylinder engine, a
continuously variable transmission for high fuel efficiency and
all-wheel drive. Body panels are plastic, as they are on other
Saturns.  &QL; 
OLDSMOBILE PROFILE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM calls this wagon-like vehicle a new type of sports sedan.
Along with Olds styling characteristics like the long, narrow
headlamps of the Aurora, Alero and Intrigue, the Profile has power
sliding rear doors, sliding flat-folding split rear seats and a
mobile communication center that could provide real-time traffic
reports, voice mail and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Profile, which is also to be shown in Los Angeles, will have
a supercharged twin-cam 3.5-liter V6, all-wheel drive, a ``shift by
wire'' transmission with no moving parts and a stability-control
system. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUICK LaCROSSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This luxury sedan, which will be displayed on Jan. 15-23 at the
Detroit show, blends a futuristic look with traditional Buick
touches, including stylized portholes on the fenders. But it also
has a pickup bed under a rear hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic hatch, tailgate and doors open or close in
response to spoken commands. Because all functions are controlled
by voice or a trackball, there are no visible gauges or controls
other than the accelerator, brake pedal and steering wheel.
Occupants would sit on leather club chairs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also to be unveiled in Detroit, the GMC Terradyne has an
extended truck cab that is pushed far forward to make room for five
passengers. As the sliding doors open, a step automatically lowers.
The truck bed can be expanded to 8 feet, from 6, by pulling out a
drawer-like tailgate; lockable trunks line the sides of the bed.
The Terradyne uses industrial materials like stainless steel for a
look of industrial precision, and it has an on-board generator that
could send power to a home in a blackout. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHEVROLET SSR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM hopes that this hybrid of sports convertible and pickup will
be a show-stopper in Detroit. With its prominent fender flares, the
styling evokes Chevy pickups of the 1940s and 50s. Inside, the SSR
has a divided cockpit like those of early Corvettes, but there is
space in the center for a third person or a child seat. A
retractable power top drops behind the seats for open-air
motoring. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OPEL CVC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This concept vehicle from GM's European unit is based on the
highly successful Zafira minivan. The compact five-door van is
outfitted for wintry regions with permanent four-wheel drive, high
ground clearance, a roof rack for winter gear and a plastic hatch
lid that doubles as a toboggan. The CCV seats six and the seats can
be moved to different positions. The roof is glass, and there are
airliner-style bins along the sides as well as heated rear cup
holders. The CCV has a prototype direct-injection, four-cylinder
gas engine. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHEVROLET TRAVERSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Traverse, a family sedan built on pickup truck architecture,
will appear at the Chicago auto show, Feb. 11-20. The five
occupants sit up high with a view of all four corners of the car.
The rear seats slide forward and backward to add more cargo or
passenger room. The seats also fold for a flat cargo floor, and the
tailgate drops and the hatch lifts skyward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Traverse comes with all-wheel drive and a 4.5-liter V6
engine and four-speed automatic transmission with push-button
electronic controls. Like the SSR's, the Traverse interior has a
twin-cockpit design and Internet access. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PONTIAC PIRANHA  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Intended to be an affordable sports car with extra room and
practicality, the Piranha has a mini-pickup bed under a rear hatch
that pulls out for loading items like skis. The mesh seats can be
removed and taken to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Interior fabrics zip on and off for customization _ buyers could
select denim, leather or jersey, for instance. The roof panels open
sideways for open-air motoring; pop-up racks offer another way to
carry skis and snowboards. The front-drive Piranha will have a
supercharged four-cylinder engine and a five-speed transmission
that would be shifted by flicking paddles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CADILLAC CONCEPT  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next March 2-12 in Geneva, Cadillac will show a yet-unnamed
vehicle that will apply the division's ``Art and Science'' theme _
first used on the Evoq roadster this year _ to a luxury sedan. The
four-seat design will have the Evoq's crisp look and many gadgets,
including information and entertainment screens built into the
seats. The show car will have an infrared Night Vision camera like
that on the 2000 DeVille; all-wheel drive, and a supercharged
version of the Northstar V8 that produces an impressive 450
horsepower. &QL;

`ANY DAY NOW' SEEKS TO SPARK DISCUSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy Miller, the creator of ``Any Day Now,'' admits that the
series isn't just there to wash over a supine sofa spud on a Sunday
night. It's expressly designed to foster dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome doesn't have to be agreement,'' Miller adds. ``It
only has to be understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, a lot of people don't want to engage in meaningful
discourse about something they've just seen on TV. Minimal
investment of brain cells is why many of them tune in in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   But some people do enjoy an occasional taffy-pull on their gray
matter, and ``Any Day Now'' does its best to comply, offering
evocative, provocative one-hour episodes each week. This Sunday,
fans get a bonus hour when Miller's poetic series about two
Birmingham, Ala., women who have been best friends since childhood
offers enough dialogue starter to keep tongues wagging for weeks on
the subjects of racial bigotry, hate crimes and white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Differentness and acceptance are always at the generous heart of
``Any Day Now,'' since the two friends of the piece are Rene
Jackson, who is black, and Mary Elizabeth ``M.E.'' Sims, who is
white.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's two-hour presentation titled ``It's Not About the
Butter,'' M.E. (Annie Potts) sets off a tempest while dining with
Rene (Lorraine Toussaint) in a restaurant. She asks a young woman
in white blouse and black skirt, the uniform of the serving staff,
for some butter. Turns out the woman is another patron who happens
to be walking past the table. She's also happens to be African
American, with a chip on her shoulder the size of the Lincoln
Memorial. The dressing-down she gives M.E. would make General
Patton proud.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, M.E. insists it was an honest mistake, but Rene allows
that M.E.'s misstep could be taken as a racial affront.
</P>
<P>
   As the title promises, the back-to-back episodes really aren't
about the butter, but the opening scene is enough to keep a
dialogue going for days, fueled cleverly by the frequent flashbacks
to the '60s, when Rene and M.E. became friends despite prevailing
``adult'' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a not entirely believable courtroom sequence near the
end, in which M.E.'s white-supremacist uncle is sued by Rene and
her mother for abhorrent antisocial behavior, this ``Any Day Now''
puts a big exclamation point on a TV season that began with lots of
noise about the number of minorities showing up _ or not showing up
_ in prime-time TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face, the networks say there's no prejudice in
casting. Yet actors of color are routinely passed over for roles
that are supposedly color-blind. Just as M.E. and Rene's
interpretations of the butter scene are contrary, the networks'
view this situation and the spurned actors' views of it are
extremely divergent. But no one really talks about it unless the
NAACP raises a stink.
</P>
<P>
   This week's ``Any Day Now'' is brutally honest, with several
``nigger'' references that range from the seemingly innocent
childhood game of ``eenie, meenie, miney, mo'' to the humiliation
of Rene's mother by M.E.'s uncle during the turbulent '60s. The
latter is a scene so hateful that reams would be written about it
if ``Any Day Now'' appeared on the schedule of a major commercial
network. Because it's on Lifetime cable, ``Any Day Now'' is less
noticed, but the series, and especially this week's presentation,
are no less important.
</P>
<P>
   Any Day Now. Special two-hour presentation addressing bigotry.
Starring Annie Potts, Lorraine Toussaint, Mae Middleton and Shari
Dyon Perry. Sunday night on Lifetime. Parental guideline rating:
TV-14.

GORE URGES BAN ON NEW OIL DRILLING IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA WATERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, going beyond Clinton
administration policy on the environment, called Thursday for a
total ban on new oil drilling in federal waters off the coasts of
California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposal would enable a Gore administration to
make ``dramatic progress'' toward a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is much more than a policy position to me _ it
is a profoundly moral obligation,'' Gore said in remarks via
satellite to environmentalists meeting in Los Angeles. Gore spoke
from Rye, N.H., during a campaign swing for his 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only one earth. And if we do not keep it healthy and
safe, every other gift we leave our children will be meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has imposed a 10-year extension of a
moratorium on leasing offshore oil tracts and a permanent ban on
leasing in national marine sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign position goes beyond this policy to halt ``all
new drilling'' in federal waters off California and Florida and to
prohibit drilling new wells in existing oil tract leases held by
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect
our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,'' Gore
said. ``I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the
coast of California and Florida. ... I will do everything in my
power to make sure that there is no new drilling off these
sensitive coasts _ even in areas already leased for drilling by
previous administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rubin, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
Gore's proposed ban would force American oil companies to shift
their new drilling abroad. This would make the United States more
dependent on foreign sources of oil and gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that because we are limited in our
access to federal lands, the companies are forced to spend their
exploration budgets overseas and this is going to simply further
that,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Ocean Industries Assn., a trade group representing
industries involved in oil and gas exploration and production on
the outer continental shelf, criticized Gore for ignoring the
rights of leaseholders who invested in the leases to explore for
oil and natural gas. Gore ``makes no mention of fairly compensating
them for what they would lose,'' the off-shore association said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the
Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group, said California and
Florida are ``two highly desirable places for complete protection.
It is great news to hear that a leader of (Gore's) stature is
taking a stand to protect both coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement by Gore's campaign noted that the state of
California, led by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, has raised concerns
about proposed new drilling off the coast. The Interior Department
has requested additional information from the oil companies
proposing new exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida, led by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a GOP candidate for president in
2000, has determined that proposed drilling off the Florida coast
``would be inconsistent with its coastal zone management plan,''
the Gore statement said. Chevron has appealed Florida's decision to
Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am placing environmental protection at the very heart of my
campaign for the presidency,'' Gore said. ``I will have no higher
priority as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., in
his bid to succeed Clinton as president. Gore's announcement may
help energize his natural constituency among environmentalists in
California, a key battleground with a presidential primary on March
7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey conducted for Cable News Network and USA
Today by the Gallup Poll that concluded on Oct. 10 showed Gore's
lead over Bradley shrinking to 12 percentage points, 51 percent to
39 percent. A survey in September showed Gore leading Bradley by 33
percentage points, 63 percent to 30 percent.

   Clinton announced a 10-year extension of the federal ban on new
oil and gas drilling off the nation's East and West coasts during a
visit to Monterey, Calif., on June 13, 1998. Clinton's compromise
position, seeking to balance environmental protection with the
economic interests of energy companies, disappointed some
environmental activists who had been seeking a permanent ban on oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., expressed disappointment at the
time. ``Our coastline deserves protection forever,'' said Boxer,
noting that Clinton's announcement moved the nation down ``the path
toward permanent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium on new offshore drilling initially had been
imposed in 1990 by President George Bush, for 10 years ending in
2000.

 &HT;    PRESIDENT SIGNS BILL DESIGNATING BLACK CANYON A NATIONAL PARK
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world-famous gorges of the Black Canyon of the
Gunnison River reached a new status Thursday as President Clinton
signed a bill making the Colorado landmark the nation's 55th
national park.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other canyon in North America combines the remarkable
depth, narrowness and sheerness of the Black Canyon of the
Gunnison,'' the president said. ``It's nearly vertical walls,
rising half a mile high, harbor one of the most spectacular
stretches of wild river in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was especially sweet for Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., who has pushed for the national park designation
for more than a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels just wonderful,'' he said, minutes after attending
the White House signing. ``I'll tell you, there were a few times
that I was thinking maybe it wasn't worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell introduced several bills through the years trying to
upgrade the 21,000-acre national monument to a national park. The
last Colorado park to receive the designation was the Rocky
Mountain National Park in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   The senator faced serious obstacles along the way _ many over
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A smiling Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Grand Junction, also attended
the White House signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have for several years introduced this legislation,'' he
said. ``This year Ben and I sensed that we had the momentum and we
took advantage of it and it happened. It's signed today. It' s
official.... I'm in euphoria.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis thanked Campbell and the Democrats in the Colorado
delegation for their help in getting the bill through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was touch and go even in the last three weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Canyon park, 12 miles east of Montrose, Colo., has
220,000 visitors each year that delight in its spectacular gorges
that cut as deep as 2,900 feet to the Gunnison River.
</P>
<P>
   The national park designation adds nearly 10,000 acres to the
canyon's boundaries. It designates about 4,100 acres inside the
canyon as wilderness, allows for 1,300 acres of conservation
easements along the rim views and establishes the 57,000-acre
Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area at the park's borders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the legislation streamlines federal management of
the Black Canyon by bringing together the National Park Service and
the Bureau of Land Management in a ``cooperative and fiscally
responsible manner, while recognizing existing land use plans,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Campbell and McInnis will be at the Black Canyon park at
11:30 a.m Saturday (10/23 ) for a dedication ceremony near the
visitors' center at the south rim, overlooking one of it's
2000-foot deep gorges.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Thursday he was ``delighted'' that Clinton gave
the park designation bill a formal signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``An area of this grandeur certainly deserves the trappings of
the Oval Office,'' he said.

industries involved in oil and gas exploration and production on
the outer continental shelf, criticized Gore for ignoring the
rights of leaseholders who invested in the leases to explore for
oil and natural gas. Gore ``makes no mention of fairly compensating
them for what they would lose,'' the off-shore association said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the
Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group, said California and
Florida are ``two highly desirable places for complete protection.
It is great news to hear that a leader of (Gore's) stature is
taking a stand to protect both coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement by Gore's campaign noted that the state of
California, led by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, has raised concerns
about proposed new drilling off the coast. The Interior Department
has requested additional information from the oil companies
proposing new exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida, led by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a GOP candidate for president in
2000, has determined that proposed drilling off the Florida coast
``would be inconsistent with its coastal zone management plan,''
the Gore statement said. Chevron has appealed Florida's decision to
Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am placing environmental protection at the very heart of my
campaign for the presidency,'' Gore said. ``I will have no higher
priority as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., in
his bid to succeed Clinton as president. Gore's announcement may
help energize his natural constituency among environmentalists in
California, a key battleground with a presidential primary on March
7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey conducted for Cable News Network and USA
Today by the Gallup Poll that concluded on Oct. 10 showed Gore's
lead over Bradley shrinking to 12 percentage points, 51 percent to
39 percent. A survey in September showed Gore leading Bradley by 33
percentage points, 63 percent to 30 percent.

   Clinton announced a 10-year extension of the federal ban on new
oil and gas drilling off the nation's East and West coasts during a
visit to Monterey, Calif., on June 13, 1998. Clinton's compromise
position, seeking to balance environmental protection with the
economic interests of energy companies, disappointed some
environmental activists who had been seeking a permanent ban on oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., expressed disappointment at the
time. ``Our coastline deserves protection forever,'' said Boxer,
noting that Clinton's announcement moved the nation down ``the path
toward permanent protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium on new offshore drilling initially had been
imposed in 1990 by President George Bush, for 10 years ending in
2000.

 &HT;    GENE-MODIFIED FOOD DRIVING HUGE INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disagreement over the safety of using transplanted
genes in food crops is causing a major dispute between the United
States and its European trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a disaster,'' Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn.,
said Thursday after being told by a member of the German Bundestag
there was no way German consumers would accept U.S. food products
that contain genetically modified products.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it very clear that we could negotiate all we want to
but in the end, he didn't think Europeans in general and Germans in
particular would ever eat products that had been genetically
modified.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about half of the soybeans produced in America and
one-third of the corn crop.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has taken the position that food
products made from genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are
safe, and that restriction on their import into European countries
amounts to a violation of international trade law.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position and the adamant refusal of European
governments to accept imports of products made from GMOs could
dominate a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Previous trade disputes, such as European resistance to American
beef from cattle treated with growth hormones and U.S. unhappiness
about European banana importing policies, have led the United
States to impose 100 percent duties on such European products as
beef, pork, canned tomatoes, cheese, mustard, leather goods, coffee
machines and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But these disputes could pale compared to the row over GMOs, say
some economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could derail not just trade in genetically modified crops
and not just agricultural trade,'' said University of Minnesota
farm economists C. Ford Runge. ``It could potentially affect the
progress toward trade liberalization, generally.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither an established European consumer movement against GMO
foods or a growing movement in the United States has been able to
point to specific dangers posed by genetically manipulated crops.
</P>
<P>
   Runge dismisses opposition to GMOs as ``phantasmagoric fears.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of labeling in the United States and a secretive
approach to the issue by U.S. regulatory agencies since the Bush
administration have fueled growing suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is under enormous pressure from the
companies that produce genetically altered seeds, the farmers who
plant them and the companies that manufacture food products from
the farmers' crops to hold the line in favor of genetically
engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the growing movement of environmental and
consumer groups is questioning the effectiveness of the U.S.
regulatory procedures involved in approving genetically engineered
crop varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Such organizations as the Consumers Union, Greenpeace, Friends
of the Earth, the Sierra Club and Mothers and Others for a Livable
Planet have begun to demand that products containing genetically
engineered harvest bear label disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody told people they had to buy an Edsel,'' said Consumers
Union official Mark Silbergeld, referring to Ford Motor Co.'s
legendary automotive flop of the late 1950s. ``If it's an Edsel,
you can do two things: You can tell them it's not an Edsel or you
can put it out there and tell them what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want the right to choose what they eat, he said, and
they will far less inclined to accept genetically modified products
when they learn that they have been eating them without knowing it
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as the Grocery Manufacturers Association of
America contend that U.S. regulation of GMOs is based on the best
scientific information and is being assaulted by ``activists'' with
a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acting together, food companies, lawmakers, scientists,
farmers and regulators must work to ensure that activists with a
political agenda do not kill the promise of biotech foods,'' said
Gary Kushner, the grocery group's Washington lawyer, in testimony
before the Senate Agriculture Committee this month.
</P>
<P>
   The association's spokesman, Brian Sansoni, said the ``political
agenda'' of such activists is simple: to kill the genetically
engineered food industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's fueled by anti-corporate sentiment or
anti-capitalism sentiment or (in the case of European groups)
anti-American sentiment or all of the above, their agenda is to
kill this technology, to stop it dead in its tracks,'' said
Sansoni. ``Right now, they're going after the mandatory labeling
route as a step toward their ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The grocery manufacturers, as well as seed producers, some farm
groups and some members of Congress, have criticized officials at
the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to
more forcefully defend U.S. regulatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of that criticism, FDA has scheduled a series
of three hearings around the country in December to hear what the
public thinks of its genetic engineering policies and to try to
better explain them.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have predicted the hearings will be flooded with
``thousands'' of Americans who are unhappy about the fact that they
have been unknowingly eating food from genetically engineered
crops.
</P>
<P>
   That could be interesting, since the hearings have been
scheduled for the same month that U.S. officials will be attempting
to persuade their counterparts from other countries at the Seattle
World Trade Organization meeting that U.S. policies ensure the
crops are safe.
</P>
<P>
   To some members of Congress, the scientific arguments may be of
secondary importance, given all that's at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you a scientific fact: We can't eat all that we
grow in this country. We have got to export,'' Gutknecht said.
``This is a huge challenge. We have got to figure out a way to
communicate and a way to negotiate with our trading partners.''

FORBES OUTLINES PLAN TO BOOST ECONOMY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Republican presidential candidate Steve
Forbes proposed Thursday a plan to boost the American economy by
overhauling the federal income tax and letting younger workers
invest their Social Security dollars in personal retirement
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning as a Washington outsider and a more conservative
alternative to Republican front-runner George W. Bush, Forbes also
pledged to fight for a longtime goal of conservative Republicans, a
constitutional amendment to require a two-thirds ``supermajority''
vote of Congress to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to remove the big government barriers that stand in
our way so that every American is free to take full advantage of
the new economy,'' the magazine publisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes announced his plan on the front lawn of Steve and
Katherine Frink's house after giving them a private briefing inside
with his wife, Sabina, performing one of the quadrennial political
rituals in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He called his plan the ``first comprehensive approach to allow
Americans to realize the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Frink said he is still undecided in the presidential race, but
told reporters he likes Forbes' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him that he has the most substance on the
table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his tax plan would save the Frink family more than
$1,000 in federal income tax each year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes vowed to ``dramatically'' reduce interest rates and
protect the soundness of the U.S. dollar by appointing Federal
Reserve Board members who ``understand that prosperity does not
cause inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to impose new spending caps on nondefense
discretionary spending, tear down trade barriers, abolish the
departments of Energy and Commerce, and eliminate funding for the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The plan eliminates loopholes and corporate tax shelters and in
return, he says, reduces the business tax rate from 35 percent to
17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of Forbes' economic plan would be a flat tax,
which he said would remove 20 million low-income workers from the
federal income tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would provide personal exemptions of $13,000 for
each adult and $5,000 for each child. That means a family of four
earning $36,000 a year would pay no federal income tax, a savings
of $1,670 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his proposal would simplify the tax system and wipe
out death taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said taxpayers would be free to file under the current
system or the new system but predicted, ``Most people will quickly
see how much they benefit with the flat tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher promised to ``fully protect'' current Social
Security benefits for Americans 55 and older _ ``no benefit cuts,
no tax increases, no more raiding the Social Security Trust Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But younger workers, he said, could choose to invest their
Social Security money into personal retirement accounts that they
alone would control.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would begin with one-third of their Social Security
taxes in 2002 and increase to two-thirds in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes' example, a single working mother who is 25
in the year 2000 could retire in 2040 with a nest egg of $1.2
million. He said she could use that money to buy an annuity that
would pay $100,000 a year, or $37,000 in 1999 dollars, almost twice
as much as she would receive from the current Social Security
System.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also proposed the creation of a ``guaranteed safety net''
for those retirees whose personal accounts don't provide a minimum
level of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate also promised to ``dramatically expand
parental control of education'' by allowing states to control their
Title 1 federal education grant money, provided the states use the
money to give parents ``true choice'' in where to educate their
children, including private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' school plan goes further than that of Texas Gov. Bush,
who has proposed that if a school is low-performing for three years
in a row, the federal government would strip it of some of its
Title I funding and give that money to the parents directly. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Forbes predicted that U.S. economic growth, under his plan,
will surge from between 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent in 2001 to at
least 4 percent in 2002 and will average at least 4.5 percent a
year for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the economy will grow from $9.8 trillion in 2001 to
$17.2 trillion in 2010, a 75 percent increase. He also predicted
the creation of 24.5 million new jobs by 2010, higher wages and a
60 percent reduction in the federal debt by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term economic projections for Forbes' proposals were
developed by Fiscal Associates, a Virginia financial forecasting
firm hired by the Forbes campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dare not entrust our fate to the lawyers, lobbyists and
lifetime politicians who control Washington today,'' he said.

FORMER PRESIDENT BREAKS TRADITION IN RELEASING 18,000 PAGES OF
PERSONAL DOCUMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ While Gov. George W. Bush tries to keep
part of his past under wraps, his father is exposing his own
history in a groundbreaking way.
</P>
<P>
   About 18,000 pages of former President Bush's letters, diaries
and other personal documents became available Thursday to
journalists, scholars and other researchers. They cover a 36-year
period, from World War II until just prior to Bush's terms as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush donated his papers to the George Bush Presidential Library
and Museum at Texas A&AMP;M University a few years ago. More recently,
he agreed to release his personal items for study _ before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the gesture unusual. The other living
ex-presidents _ Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan _ have
their personal papers under seal while they are alive, according to
David Alsobrook, executive director of the Bush facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells us a lot about him, that he does want people to come
and study his life,'' Alsobrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Bush documents are bound to turn political heads.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes Bush's memos, as chairman of the
national Republican Party, to the Republican president, Richard
Nixon, in the year and a half before Nixon's resignation in August
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in one of the memos that Democrat Barbara Jordan,
serving then as the first black Congress member from Houston, had
volunteered as a secret, unofficial political consultant for the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara has secretly offered to consult me on a
non-attributable basis about Black attitudes, Black problems,
etc,'' Bush told Nixon in February 1973. ``She'll undoubtedly fight
us on programs but she won't use this channel to embarrass me. She
conceivably could help in getting southern liberals to vote for
Republicans instead of conservative Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication from the documents whether Jordan ever
followed through. In the following year she voted for Nixon's
impeachment as a member of the House Judiciary Committee. She died
a steadfast Democrat in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the Bush documents coincides with the publication
of the 75-year-old former president's book, ``All The Best, George
Bush: My Life In Letters And Other Writings.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Bush delivered a campus lecture about the
book.
</P>
<P>
   It is called ``the most intimate and revealing look at one of
America's most private public figures'' by its publisher, Scribner.
But the New York Times Book Review said it is devoid of ``a single
glittering sentence or brilliant observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said the collection of letters is in lieu of a memoir
about his life in and out of the White House. Such a work, he said,
has already been written by his wife. It is called ``Barbara Bush:
A Memoir'' and was published in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The former president's new book starts with letters he wrote to
his parents from a Navy aviation school in 1942 and ends with
letters he wrote to friends as a retired grandfather enjoying life
in Houston this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to follow the ex-president's book is an autobiography by
his son George W. Bush, the leading GOP contender for president.
The Texas governor has already stated, however, that he will not
provide details of what he calls his ``young and irresponsible''
days.
</P>
<P>
   The papers released at the Bush Library cover the elder Bush's
career from 1943 through 1979, before he served as vice president
and president but including his stints as a pilot, businessman,
congressional candidate, ambassador, Republican Party chief and
director of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest in the papers is Bush's ``Peking Diary,''
which he wrote while serving as the U.S. envoy to China 1974-75,
Alsobrook said. Scholars will likely consider it a trove for the
study of U.S. foreign policy, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   A few portions of the diary were removed in the interest of
national security, Alsobrook said. Also, the library has received
from Bush only the documents that he wanted to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a departure from tradition. Other ex-presidents
have put some of their government documents on display during their
lifetimes but have arranged for personal papers to be held back
until after their death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be stuff in there they don't want to be accountable
for in their lifetimes,'' University of Texas professor Bruce
Buchanan, an expert on the presidency, said of the tradition. ``And
there may be personal stuff they just don't think is anybody's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush apparently has a ``squeaky clean''
background that makes him less reluctant to release personal
papers, Buchanan said, so ``this sounds like something new and
different'' for scholars who study presidential papers.
</P>
<P>
   Alsobrook said the Bush papers could make other former
presidents re-think their adherence to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see, when we open ours, if the
others follow suit,'' said Alsobrook, who worked as the supervisory
archivist at the library housing former President Carter's papers.
</P>
<P>
   The 18,000 pages of Bush documents represent a smidgen of the 4
million pages that have been collected by the Bush Library. Much of
that comes from government sources and people who provided
information about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 researchers have examined Bush documents at the
library since it opened in January 1998. But the document release
Thursday caused no land rush: By mid-afternoon, the only person who
signed in to inspect them was a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Some of the materials are mundane collections of newspaper
clippings, and a mostly blank appointment book from 1968, the year
George W. Bush graduated from college.
</P>
<P>
   But the file on former President Bush's days as chairman of the
national GOP appears to throw new light on the Watergate scandal,
which led to Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In handwritten notes about a Nixon ``enemies list'' put together
by White House aides, Bush said in July 1973 that the list was
``dumb, because those idiots that put it together were so knee-jerk
that they fouled it up _ they put people on the list who eventually
supported the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush expressed his faith in Nixon in the same memo, however,
saying that the president ``would not demean our constitution.''
Two months later, the documents show, Nixon sent Bush a note
thanking Bush for ``your constant loyal friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1974, however, Bush urged Nixon to resign _ as Nixon
did a day later. Bush quit as party chief a few weeks afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after becoming chairman, Bush wrote to Nixon aide
H.R. Haldeman in March 1973 with suggestions about how to change
the image of the party's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminate phone in car _ eliminate full-time driver _
eliminate liquor from premises (with personal reluctance because
after some of the backbiting, hand-holding days, I could use a
swallow),'' he wrote.

HILLARY CLIMTON CITES MORE DIFFERENCES WITH GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to poke
holes Thursday in New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's claims that an
economic miracle is buoying the fortunes of everyone in the
nation's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, expected to announce her New York Senate candidacy in
January, told leaders of New York's 265,000-member Civil Service
Employees Association at a meeting here that poverty is actually
rising in some neighborhoods in the city governed by her likely
Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani have completed legal steps required to run
for the Senate, but they have not yet declared their candidacies to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew issue-by-issue distinctions with positions taken by
Giuliani during her 28-minute address. It was the first time that
she has staged a public event here relating to the New York race.
</P>
<P>
   Her red-meat speech appeared to delight many in the audience of
1,100 leaders of the bipartisan union that represents state, county
and local government employees as well as some private sector
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into New York City, you would think that everybody
is just enjoying the most amazing economic boom that the world has
ever seen,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed that for many New Yorkers, poverty is on the wane as
it is across the nation, thanks to the longest peacetime economic
boom in American history.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that ``in the midst of this incredible economic
boom there are neighborhoods in New York City that have not yet
realized the full benefits. So we have work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised a White House initiative that provides private
enterprises many of the same tax breaks and incentives to invest in
America's inner cities that have been available for years to firms
investing in markets overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time that we brought that economic opportunity back
to New York and around the country,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said her remarks
were the third effort she had made in the past week to draw
distinctions between herself and Giuliani on certain issues. But
Clinton herself never mentioned Giuliani by name in her Thursday
speech.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that she supports hiking the minimum wage, expanding
the earned income tax credit for the working poor, strengthening
patient rights in health maintenance organizations and devoting the
federal budget surplus to bolstering Social Security and Medicare.
She said these positions contrasted with those of ``some who
believe'' that no action is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have work to do,'' Clinton declared, repeatedly
arousing ovations from the audience. ``We've made a lot of progress
together, but that progress could be reversed if people who don't
share those values hold office into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also discounted Giuliani's claims of being the
crime buster who made New York City safe for suburbanites. She said
White House programs, including one using federal funds to put more
police on the street, have driven the nationwide crime rate down to
mid-1960s levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tremendous accomplishment, and I am pleased that
mayors and police chiefs all over America supported the president's
anticrime strategy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Union President Danny Donohue said the organization has endorsed
Republicans and Democrats for office in New York state. He said
that in 1991 it gave Bill Clinton one of the earliest union
endorsements of his first presidential campaign. But last year the
union did not endorse either U.S. Senate candidate _ then-Rep.
Charles Schumer, a Democrat, and Republican incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato. Schumer won.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hillary Clinton, Donohue said, ``our members decide to
support candidates based on their positions on issues that we care
about, not based on the party of the candidate. People in New York
know that the first lady is right on most of our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiliani has opposed moves in Congress to hike the $5.15 minimum
wage by $1 over the next two years because he said it might
jeopardize entry-level jobs being filled by former welfare
recipients moving into the work force. He also backed the
Republican-passed $792 billion tax cut over 10 years that President
Clinton vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Thursday, Giuliani took part in a $100,000 breakfast
fund-raiser with 1,600 ``Women for Rudy,'' many wearing lapel
buttons with a slash through a picture of the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y. derided the first lady's
appearances around the state to listen to New Yorkers' concerns. In
contrast to ``months of listening by Mrs. Clinton,'' Giuliani has
demonstrated ``months of action,'' Molinari said.

FRENCH COURT UPHOLDS CONVICTION OF VICHY-ERA OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On Thursday France's highest court upheld the conviction
of Maurice Papon, the 89-year-old former civil servant who
announced Wednesday that he would flee the country rather than
begin his 10-year jail sentence for sending hundreds of Jews to
Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the court, Holocaust survivors smiled, shouted bravo and
wept.
</P>
<P>
   French officials immediately issued an arrest warrant for Papon,
who disappeared from his home near Paris more than a week ago but
who has been issuing statements through his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under French law, Papon was supposed to surrender to authorities
Wednesday to begin his sentence before his appeal could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the combative and articulate former Vichy
government official said in a statement that he would ``go into
exile'' rather than spend his last years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Papon, who has always maintained his innocence despite his
signature on numerous deportation orders, said that in deciding on
exile, he was making an honorable choice that had been made by
``many noted men in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-highest-ranking official in the Bordeaux area during
the war, Papon later rose to become a budget minister in France's
postwar government. His trial, which began in 1997, was the longest
and most expensive in France's modern history. It forced the
country to confront a part of its past that many had tried to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   As the court made its ruling Thursday, government officials
scrambled to explain how Papon could have escaped so easily.
Despite his conviction, nothing had been done to restrict his
movements in any way, and he had even been allowed to keep his
passport.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said Papon had benefited from
a loophole in the law because he had been released from jail during
his trial because of poor health. Once he was released, she said,
there was no legal basis by which to control his movements. She
promised to submit legislation in January to close the loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about where Papon had gone continued throughout the
day. Swiss officials confirmed that Papon was in Switzerland last
week in the western town of Martigny, though his current
whereabouts remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Under French law, if defendants do not turn themselves in to
spend the night in prison, their appeals are automatically
rejected. In court Thursday morning, the prosecutor in the case,
Bruno Cotte, urged the court not to make an exception in Papon's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice Papon, who has deliberately chosen not to turn himself
in, using the press to create a sort of indecent and invidious aura
of suspense, must now see the common law applied,'' Cotte argued.
</P>
<P>
   The court broke with its usual protocol and allowed Papon's
lawyers to make their legal arguments for a delay. But at 5 p.m. it
rejected the arguments, ruling that Papon lost his right of appeal
when he failed to report to prison. The ruling closes the door on
any further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Papon's chief lawyer, Jean-Marc Varaut, said after the hearing
that the court ruling justified Papon's decision to flee. He said
he would try to take the case before the European Court of Human
Rights to condemn the French courts. ``We have no other choice,''
he said.

<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y. derided the first lady's

contrast to ``months of listening by Mrs. Clinton,'' Giuliani has
demonstrated ``months of action,'' Molinari said.

 &HT;    CONGRESS USES ADVANCE PLANNING, DELAYED PAYING TO ASSIST
BUDGETING
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the squeeze to pass budget bills that fit under
this year's budget caps, Congress is increasingly planning to pay
later for what it promises now.
</P>
<P>
   That is, lawmakers are pledging funds for programs, including
education for the disadvantaged, job training and the Head Start
program for preschoolers. But some of those outlays would be put
off until the following fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advanced funding,'' as the technique is called, has long been
used by Congress on a limited basis for programs that cross over
into the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has now become the most popular way to avoid the
tight spending limits for fiscal year 2000. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that more than $20 billion in spending
authority from bills now moving through Capitol Hill would be held
over until the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That's roughly double the advance spending approved last year
and ten times as much as Congress approved for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those gimmick indicators,'' said Robert Bixby,
executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan watchdog
group on the budget. The delayed spending merely postpones the
problem of meeting spending limits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gambling that the non-Social Security surplus will be
higher next year and that they can therefore afford to put this
spending off into the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced spending won't necessarily bust the budget this year,
but it does little for the credibility of the budget-making
process, says Bixby and other budget watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the appearance of cutting spending when they're
not,'' said James Horney, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it makes the problem even worse for next year, when
the budget caps will be even tighter. ``When they get to '01,
they're back where they started,'' Horney said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bixby said that the final result is still
uncertain because Congress is passing the spending bills based on a
vast array of projections for the $1.8 trillion federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably will comply with the goal of balancing the
budget on paper, and a lot of us will say it will only be with
gimmicks,'' Bixby said. ``We'll probably have to wait until next
year to find out how it all worked out.''

is financing a transition that will result not in broken dreams or
the end of a way of life, but in a new generation of highly
efficient dairies that will only widen California's lead over
Wisconsin and the No. 3 dairy state, New York. In an odd twist, the
spread of all those new subdivisions and their backyard swimming
pools has proven something of a boon to the dairy industry. By

CORPS ENROLLMENT DOWN AT TEXAS A&AMP;M 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim, optional ending) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M University's Corps of Cadets, which produces more
military officers than any U.S. school outside the service
academies, has seen a 10.7 percent drop in enrollment this fall,
officials confirmed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1,962 cadets, including 149 women, are enrolled in the ROTC
program, compared with 2,197 last fall, said Doc Mills, spokesman
for the corps. The corps signed up 564 freshman recruits this fall;
last year there were 776 freshmen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been ups and downs, ups and downs,'' said Mills, a
former cadet. ``This year, we had a down. Next year, we hope it
will be up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills and Will Schrank, the corps' recruiting director, said
part of the reason enrollment is down is that the College Station
university had an abnormally large freshman class last year, and an
unusually small one this year, shrinking the pool of potential
corps applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a new standardized application form for all state
universities does not include a box to check if prospective
students want to indicate their interest in the corps.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills and Schrank said other factors also may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it could be the general unpopularity of military
service or military careers these days,'' Mills said. ``It could
also be the booming economy that makes civilian careers much more
attractive. A lot of these students come from the civilian economy
and they bring those attitudes with them when they come to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the corps also declines when the U.S. military is
engaged overseas, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this class was making the decision of what colleges to
apply to and whether to come into the corps or not, there was the
Kosovo air campaign, with people shooting at one another,'' he
said. ``Historically, we find that moms get a little jittery about
sending their sons to a military organization when there are people
shooting at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the corps' goal, which is unlikely to be met, was to
reach 2,600 cadets by next year. That number would fill the 12
dormitories that are set aside for the corps. Currently rooms in
two of the dorms are occupied by civilian students.
</P>
<P>
   Schrank said that while he is watching the numbers, he's more
concerned about attracting quality cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after the top students,'' he said. ``But beyond
the academic qualifications, we're looking for those who have been
actively involved in leadership positions in high school, whether
it be in athletics, or student government, or other organizations.
We're not going after those who have been couch potatoes for four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To attract such students, the corps staff and former and current
cadets mail out brochures and participate in ``phone pushes,''
using telemarketing techniques to persuade high school juniors and
seniors to come to campus and check out the corps.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective members are then invited to a ``Spend the Night with
the Corps'' program. Each year, 1,600 to 1,800 high schoolers
accept. They go to class with a corps member, stay overnight in the
corps dorms and meet with the university's admissions and financial
aid counselors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Aggie tradition may be the biggest reason A&AMP;M students
join the corps, Schrank said many cadets are attracted by the
corps' discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more structured lifestyle with a major focus on
academic excellence,'' he said. ``A lot of students who want to go
to med school or law school are attracted to the corps because they
believe it's a place where they can focus on their studies, rather
than going out to bars, clubs or movies, or whatever else college
students do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Call to Quarters,'' a mandatory study hall, forces cadets to
sit at their desks and study for three hours a night, Sunday
through Thursday. And as students approach graduation, career
counselors help connect them with business people, many of whom are
former Aggies, who are interested in recruiting cadets for
internships and full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Other cadets join for the instant friendship and camaraderie on
a campus with more than 42,000 students, Schrank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be part of a smaller tightknit group of students
where everybody in the dorm knows them by name, where upperclassmen
look out for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though only 30 percent of the cadets sign up for
military service after graduation, Schrank said the corps in recent
years has improved its services for the other 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever they end up, they're going to have to know how to
work with people,'' he said. ``They're going to have to know how to
follow, how to lead, how to interact with people at work. Those are
skills they can learn in the corps.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schrank said officials are now concentrating on recruiting for
next year, which is going well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a goal to increase corps enrollment,'' he said,
``but I'm not discouraged by these numbers. I'm very optimistic
about where we're headed and about the future of the corps.''

SARGENT PORTRAITS OF 9 MEMBERS OF A BRITISH FAMILY UNITED AT THE
JEWISH MUSEUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chutzpah of Asher Wertheimer! A rich London art
dealer and the son of a self-made German Jew, he commissioned John
Singer Sargent (1856-1925), then at the height of his fame as a
portraitist, to paint no less than a dozen likenesses of his
family. He willed that nine of them should join the pantheon of
great British citizens at the National Portrait Gallery after his
and his wife's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the portraits _ Sargent's biggest commission
from a single family _ as the ``gift'' to the nation that roused
the ire of English worthies. Too many and too much for some
officials _ one member of Parliament referred to the paintings as
``clever, but extremely repulsive'' _ the Wertheimer portraits were
exhibited as an ensemble for a short time, then sent to the Tate
Gallery, where they hung together in a room devoted to Sargent. But
the artist's reputation was by then in decline, and the
installation was eventually dismantled, with all but two of the
paintings consigned to storage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in ``John Singer Sargent: Portraits of the Wertheimer
Family'' at the Jewish Museum here, all of the portraits are
together again, for the first time since they hung at the
Wertheimer's London residence more than 70 years ago. The dozen
works _ some dazzling, a few tepid _ done from 1898 to 1908, are
fittingly on view in what was once the drawing rooms of the Warburg
house, owned by a privileged Jewish family contemporary with the
Wertheimers that is now the home of the Jewish Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But why single out these Jewish subjects from the 600-odd
aristocrats, politicians, merchant princes, society ladies,
theatrical personalities and others, both striving and arrived, who
beat a path to this high-style virtuoso's easel? The Wertheimers
were not Sargent's only Jewish subjects; he had painted the
Sassoons and the Rothschilds, among others. But the Wertheimer
ensemble, because of its size and the less secure social footing of
its participants, raises interesting issues: among them the
position of Jews in English society; Sargent's clever adaptation of
English ``grand manner'' portraiture to flatter contemporary
climbers, and the efforts of the arriviste Wertheimer to gain
status for his family by insinuating their portraits into a museum
devoted to exalted Britons.
</P>
<P>
   Such matters as these are tellingly taken up in the catalog by
Norman L. Kleeblatt, curator of fine arts at the Jewish Museum and
organizer of the exhibition; Kathleen Adler, head of education at
the National Gallery in London whose research inspired the show;
Trevor Fairbrother, a Sargent specialist and deputy director and
curator of modern art at the Seattle Art Museum, and Michelle
Lapine, assistant curator of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portraits themselves, there is Asher Wertheimer
(1898), depicted as a sensuous, convivial man with a cigar in his
left hand, his dog, Noble, large pink tongue hanging out, seated at
his right. (The Wertheimer family loved this portrait, and it has
always been a popular one with the museumgoing public.) There is
his wife, Flora (1904), looking sternly matriarchal in a proper
black dress as she sits in a sumptuous chair. There are group and
individual renderings of the 10 Wertheimer children, including a
double portrait of the two oldest daughters, Ena and Betty (1901).
Shown as the vivacious Edwardian belles they were, in a bravura
work that is today considered one of Sargent's masterpieces, they
too exude sexual vitality.
</P>
<P>
   It's the contention of Ms. Adler that Sargent _ who enjoyed an
affectionate relationship with the Wertheimers _ not disapprovingly
stressed their Jewishness in his portraits, giving them the slight
edge of caricature and stereotype that he conferred on many of his
subjects, Jewish or not.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, she writes, the exuberant portrait of the two daughters in
their decollete gowns alludes to ``a fantasy of the sexual Jewess''
held by non-Jews; the portrait of their father ``could be, and
indeed often was, regarded as the very image of the stereotype of
the rich Jew, excessively flashy and, since art dealing was viewed
as only slightly above moneylending, probably of somewhat dubious
honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sargent's depiction of a third daughter, Almina (1908), puts her
in a Persian costume holding a musical instrument from northern
India. ``The portrait is in many respects a parody, a play on the
stereotype of the Jewish (or Oriental) princess,'' writes Ms.
Adler.
</P>
<P>
   But Sargent, an ``outsider'' himself by virtue of his American
origins and his homosexuality, dined weekly chez Wertheimer and was
close to Asher and Ena. If he saw them as ethnically exploitable
subjects, he also took the view that they were ``interesting
models'' and ``reliable patrons,'' words he used about Jewish
subjects in general to a colleague. He observed to friends that he
preferred painting Jewish to English women because they had ``more
life and movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adler adds that these portraits are not simply caricatural
nor do they simply subscribe to anti-Semitic stereotypes. Sargent's
knowledge of and affection for the family works to counter this
stereotype and his sitters, particularly Ena and Almina, appear to
have delighted in the opportunity to strike exaggerated poses and
wear fancy dress.
</P>
<P>
   But putting aside the ``Jewish'' issues surrounding the
Wertheimer portraits, the ensemble _ a whole greater than the sum
of all its parts _ gives a wonderful account not only of Sargent's
bold brushwork but also of his talent for finding and projecting
his subjects' individual identities. Despite the bombast of clothes
and settings, the family comes across as a very human company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another entry in the spate of recent Sargent shows
(the major spread was the Tate Gallery retrospective at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts
in Boston) that have been re-evaluating his career and reputation.
If you hurry, you can see ``John Singer Sargent, Draughtsman: Works
From the Corcoran Gallery of Art'' at the Grey Art Gallery of New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   With over 90 works on paper from the collection of the Corcoran
Gallery in Washington, the show ranges from European landscapes
made at the age of 12 (born to American expatriates, Sargent spent
his life abroad) to studies for mural commissions by the Boston
Public Library and its Museum of Fine Arts. Also included are
sketches _ poignant and mundane _ of soldiers and military
activities done at the Western front during World War I. Sargent
later used them in a major painting, ``Gassed'' (1918-19),
commissioned by the Imperial War Museum and in a commemorative
mural for the Widener Library at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings reveal Sargent's growing mastery of draftsmanship
and his concern with the expressive possibilities of line,
silhouette and shading. In later studies of the figure, he
relentlessly explored every conceivable twist or turn that human or
animal bodies could take. As his theme for the library mural
commission Sargent chose a history of the world's religions. Among
the painstaking male nude and animal studies he did for it is ``Man
Screaming'' (1895-1910), an affecting rendition of a man writhing
in agony, head down, mouth open, hands clenched in fists on his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this with the genteel classical maidens, ``The
Danaides,'' a series of women representing the many sources of
wisdom that he did as part of a mural decoration for the museum.
Using models said to have been drawn from the Ziegfeld Follies, he
drew the women, draped in classical garments, carrying jugs as they
paraded in ceaseless replenishment of the fountain of knowledge.
(The decorations were cited as ``ladylike'' by the art historian
Bernard Berenson.)
</P>
<P>
   Conveying as they do the ``bones'' of Sargent's style, the
drawings give a fascinating look beneath the sensuous surfaces of
his painting, revealing the masterly linear skills that accompanied
the seemingly effortless flow of his brush. Unfortunately, few of
his portrait drawings are here, but the show is a worthy addendum
to the splashier displays of Sargent on canvas.

`TRUE WEST' ON BROADWAY; FUTURE OF `RAGTIME'; AN AUSTRALIAN IS
CAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``True West,'' Sam Shepard's dark comedy about a pair
of feuding brothers on the make in Hollywood, is coming to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsals will likely begin in mid-December for a February
opening at Circle in the Square. Casting was coming together late
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kastner is the producer. The director will be Matthew
Warchus, who directed an acclaimed version of the play in 1994 at
the Donmar Warehouse in London and recently directed a film version
of Shepard's ``Simpatico.''
</P>
<P>
   A perennial favorite of angry young acting students and their
directors, ``True West'' tells the story of Austin and Lee, a
screenwriter and a layabout, whose fortunes reverse in a hail of
sibling rivalry and demolished toasters. The play had its New York
premiere at the Public Theater in 1980, but its seminal production
came in 1982 when two then-unknowns named Gary Sinise and John
Malkovich took the stage in an Off Broadway revival at the Cherry
Lane Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The news coincides with the announcement that the on-again,
off-again production of Yasmina Reza's ``Unexpected Man'' is off
again. The production was to have been directed by Warchus, but
producers said this week that they had not found a male lead to
play opposite the already confirmed Eileen Atkins, and would delay
plans for a January production at the Gramercy Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout Theater Co., which was to have been the
co-producer of the play, said it had no replacement production, but
that a possibility was Martin Sherman's ``Rose,'' about one woman's
life as part of the Jewish Diaspora. The play, which ran at
London's Royal National Theater last summer, starred Olympia
Dukakis, who would likely appear in New York as well.
</P>
<P>
   A SOBERING SONG
</P>
<P>
   Might it be time for ``Ragtime'' to go?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question being mulled by producers of the show, a
big-budget musical that has seen its box-office receipts thin in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions about the production's future have been going on
since August, when the show's original producer, Livent Inc., was
bought by SFX Entertainment, the country's largest producer of live
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've assessed all the information about the show,'' said
Miles Wilkin, chairman of Pace Theatrical Group, a subsidiary of
SFX, ``and we're in the process of coming to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkin would not provide specifics, but three options are being
considered. The first is to shrink the size of the production's
cast and other expenses to permit a longer run at the Ford Center
of the Performing Arts, where the musical plays. That would require
a six-week hiatus to adhere to Actors Equity union rules forbidding
sudden downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   In another scenario, the show would shrink, move to a different
theater, and the Ford Center would be rented to another production.
</P>
<P>
   The third option, and the least palatable one for the producers
and creative crew, would be to close the production altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkin said a decision could be made within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With a large cast, a lavish production and generous contracts
held over its Livent days, ``Ragtime'' has long had one of the
highest operating costs on Broadway. Before recent cost cuts, the
weekly expenses often exceeded $600,000. That number seemed
acceptable when the show was reporting grosses of more than
$800,000 a week, as it did for much of 1998 and early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But visions of a ``Cats''-style run have faded as recent
box-office figures have sagged. For the week ending Sunday,
``Ragtime'' grossed $600,010. In the second week of September, the
gross sunk to $420,902.
</P>
<P>
   Producers have received royalty concessions from the creative
staff and overtime concessions from stagehands, which have cut
operating costs to about $530,000 a week. A new marketing campaign
has also helped sales, Wilkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is trying their hardest,'' he said. ``I'm not saying
it's rare in this business, but it has been encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a ``Ragtime'' closing and an available Ford
Center has prompted speculation around Broadway about who might
fill the show's large shoes. An oft-mentioned candidate is ``Jesus
Christ Superstar,'' the Andrew Lloyd Webber revival, which is
aiming for an April opening. Officials for the production said they
are still seeking a theater, but had no comment on the prospect of
moving to the Ford.
</P>
<P>
   UP FROM DOWN UNDER
</P>
<P>
   David Campbell may be the most respected young musical theater
star in New York to never actually perform in a full-scale
production.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Campbell, a 26-year-old Australian actor and cabaret
singer, has sung in such prized locales as Carnegie Hall and City
Center, and has been cast in workshops of productions from ``Don
Juan DeMarco'' to last week's ``Thoroughly Modern Millie.'' And in
each, the reports have been good to glowing.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, Campbell has never been in a real show. The
closest he came was in February when he appeared in ``Babes in
Arms,'' part of the Encore musical concert series at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   That is about to change. Starting in January, Campbell is to
lead the cast of ``Saturday Night,'' the early Stephen Sondheim
musical making its New York premiere at Second Stage. Campbell will
play Gene, a character he describes as ``a young man who dreams of
other things and doesn't quite know how to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly not the case for Campbell. In the last three
years, he has released two solo CD's, won a handful of cabaret
awards and has been named Young Australian of the Year (narrowly
outpolling Dame Edna).
</P>
<P>
   Most of his performing has been done alone, but ``I didn't plan
it this way, I promise,'' Campbell said. He added, ``It's going to
be good to be able to play with others.''
</P>
<P>
   IN THE PINK AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``James Joyce's `The Dead''' will perform a special
matinee this afternoon at 3 to make up for three performances lost
earlier this week. Marni Nixon, who plays Aunt Kate Morkan, was
sick and had no understudy so performances were canceled on Tuesday
and Wednesday.

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am at the boiling point!'' Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote to
Susan B. Anthony about the fledging women's rights movement in the
spring of 1852. ``If I do not find some day the use of my tongue on
this question, I shall die of an intellectual repression, a woman's
rights convulsion! Oh, Susan! Susan! Susan! You must manage to
spend a week with me before the Rochester convention, for I am
afraid that I cannot attend it. ... How much I do long to be free
from housekeeping and children, so as to have some time to read and
think and write.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's cry of frustration was sent from Seneca Falls, N.Y.,
her unhappy home on the outskirts of what was then a depressing
19th-century mill town. Anthony, who would be her friend and
collaborator in the fight for women's suffrage over the next half
century, was in Rochester, N.Y., in a prosperous neighborhood of
merchants and bankers, an enormous psychic distance but only 50
miles on the map. Jane Hunt, who was the host of the 1848 tea party
that gave birth to the first women's rights convention, was only
three miles from Seneca Falls, in Waterloo, N.Y. Mary Ann
M'Clintock, whose home was the site for the drafting of the
Declaration of Sentiments read by Stanton at the Seneca Falls
convention, was in Waterloo, too.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 miles west of Seneca Falls, in Geneva, N.Y., Elizabeth
Blackwell received the first medical degree conferred on a woman,
in 1849. That same year, in Seneca Falls, Amelia Bloomer started
The Lily, her women's rights publication. Eight years later, just
25 miles east of Geneva, Harriet Tubman settled in Auburn, N.Y.,
after helping hundreds of slaves reach freedom on the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   The geography is striking: So many women seeking reform rose to
prominence in such a short time span in such a small space in
western New York! Not long ago, my husband and I and our two
children, ages 9 and 5, spent a long, glorious weekend finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Since there were a lot of musty 19th-century houses to be seen,
we interspersed the antiques and display cases with parks, beaches,
vineyards and some of the most elaborate hotels of the Finger
Lakes. As a result, the children were kept from mutiny _ in fact,
our 9-year-old daughter enjoyed much of the Women's Rights National
Historical Park _ while the adults found the weekend a revelation.
Trips are so often geared to one huge (male) historical figure,
like Jefferson at Monticello. But we found it a more intimate
experience to pick out a series of less monumental homes that serve
as a record of women connected by time, place and passion.
</P>
<P>
   We started out late on a Friday night from our home in
Westchester County, N.Y., drove two hours to Albany, then collapsed
at a motel. This gave us a good start on Saturday for the Anthony
house in Rochester, four hours away.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in time for an afternoon tour of the well-tended,
three-story red-brick house with wisteria growing alongside the
front porch. Anthony lived here for the last 40 years of her life,
her most politically active period, when she traveled extensively
for suffrage. Inside is a proper Victorian home, now a dark and
sleepy museum, but with touching mementos: Anthony's satchel and
alligator purse, walls of pictures of suffrage leaders, the simple
bed in which Anthony died.
</P>
<P>
   Our well-informed and talkative guide, Betty Allinger, related
one of the most famous stories associated with Anthony and the
house: how in 1872 Anthony tested the laws and voted, only to be
arrested at home two weeks later by a U.S. deputy marshal, then
taken away in a streetcar. When the conductor asked Anthony for her
fare, Anthony retorted, ``I'm traveling at the expense of the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Sunday, we went to tour the home of Stanton,
which I had seen on a previous trip, only to learn that one guide
was off and the other out sick. As a result the house would be
closed until Thursday. (I recommend calling ahead to all the houses
when planning a trip; despite what guidebooks say about hours, many
are open at odd times.) Grumpily wondering if this would ever
happen at Monticello, I was still able to tour the visitors' center
of the Women's Rights National Historical Park as well as the
restored Wesleyan Chapel, where the first women's rights convention
was held. The park, part of the National Park Service, is scattered
across urban parcels in Seneca Falls and Waterloo, and includes the
Stanton house on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned home, I called Jack E. Shay, the park service
ranger who had led my extensive tour of the Stanton house on the
earlier trip and who is also the co-author of ``Arcane America,''
which he called a ``thinking person's travelogue'' about 101 of the
best places you've never heard of. Shay can tell you all about
Stanton's wallpaper (mostly a white-and-green floral, one of the
brighter patterns of the day) and her piano (a Gilbert from
Boston).
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's house is a light and relatively airy white clapboard
farmhouse, with elements of modified Greek Revival style, decorated
with Stanton's original mahogany fold-open desk. ``She had good
taste,'' Shay said. ``She was used to living in rather expensive
digs.'' The house is missing two wings, but it still has a feeling
associated with its most famous owner: clean, strong, confident
lines, no nonsense, no gewgaws.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, who supplied the speeches that Anthony delivered (``I
forged the thunderbolts and Susan fired them''), had moved from
Boston, where she had been part of a progressive, liberal circle
that included William Lloyd Garrison, Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo
Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne. The switch to Seneca Falls seems
to have been made for her husband's political career in the
Legislature in Albany and also because her father, an influential
judge and former congressman, owned the house and gave it to the
couple. Although Stanton despised the drudgery of Seneca Falls, she
also admitted in a letter to Anthony that ``it may be well for me
to understand all the trials of woman's lot, that I may more
eloquently proclaim them when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday we also took a look at the big, four-columned,
red-brick Jane Hunt house on East Main Street in Waterloo, from the
outside only. The house is privately owned, but there was a
for-sale sign out front. The real estate agent, Greg Peet, will
tell you that the asking price is $139,900 for three bedrooms,
three baths and history. The park service said it was interested in
buying the house, and Peet said the owners were concerned about its
preservation, but he also said they wanted to sell to the highest
bidder. Not far away is the M'Clintock house, a red-brick
Federal-style building owned by the park service and under
extensive restoration. We peeked briefly inside; it is a shell at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva we looked for the site of the Geneva Medical College,
long burned down, which Elizabeth Blackwell attended. On Main
Street we found all that's left, a plaque, and also Joan Braun, who
came out of her house when she saw us looking confused. Mrs. Braun,
the immediate past president of the Geneva Chamber of Commerce,
showed us where the college had been, then invited us in to see her
house and its view of Seneca Lake. I asked if people came by often
on the trail of Blackwell. ``All the time,'' she said. ``I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she pointed us to an Elizabeth Blackwell statue a short
walk away on the campus of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, a
tribute to a woman who was rejected by at least 15 medical schools
before her admission to Geneva. On the statue is part of an 1847
letter that Blackwell sent from Geneva: ``I cannot but congratulate
myself on having found at last the right place for my beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop was the Harriet Tubman home, where the Rev. Paul
G. Carter and his wife, Christine, showed the children an evocative
cartoon of Tubman's life, then gave us a tour of the simple
two-story white-frame house with a big front porch. Most of the
furnishings are not original, but Tubman's bed and Bible are, and
the tour was somber and moving.
</P>
<P>
   We spent one night at Belhurst Castle in Geneva, an expensive
old ivy-covered Romanesque pile that looks out dramatically over
Seneca Lake, and another at Geneva-on-the-Lake, a small resort just
up the road that has less personality and higher prices than
Belhurst Castle. We had a basic tour and wine-tasting at the Wagner
Winery in Lodi, a good lunch at the vineyard's Ginny Lee Cafe and a
good dinner at Pasta Only's Cobblestone Restaurant in Geneva. One
of the highlights for the children was a hike up through the
amazing gorge at Watkins Glen State Park at the southern end of
Seneca Lake in Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Why did so many female reformers spring up out of western New
York in the mid-19th century? There's no simple answer, but it was
a time of ferment, of great pressure for social change _
abolitionism, temperance, religious revivalism, prison and
education reform _ and of great economic development. The opening
of the Erie Canal not only transformed New York City, but also made
the towns between Lake Erie and New York _ including Seneca Falls,
Rochester, Waterloo and Geneva _ important centers of commerce and
thought.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is available in books. But what is available only by
traveling is the sense of history by proximity, of seeing how
geography led to connections and then ideas. In house after house,
the connections came up: Tubman knew Anthony through the
abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who knew everyone, including
Stanton, who knew Hunt and M'Clintock and Bloomer, who introduced
Stanton to Anthony. And it was Stanton who in 1861 recorded in her
diary that she had ``fitted out a fugitive slave for Canada with
the help of Harriet Tubman.''

UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA INSTITUTE TO FOCUS ON AGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRIAN GELLER   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ A new University of Florida institute will
devote itself to one of Florida's most salient issues: getting
older.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute on Aging, approved recently by the university's
board of regents, will serve as an umbrella organization to foster
multidisciplinary research, education and service, stimulate
increased funding and influence public policy, UF officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A university community really needs to be addressing the
important issues that confront a society,'' said Jeffrey Dwyer,
director of the new institute. ``Arguably, aging is one of those.
When you couple with the state of Florida, then you really begin to
see that the University of Florida ought to be viewed nationally as
a leader in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the elderly will more than
double in population by 2050, to 80 million. A large part of
Florida's population is made up of people over 65.
</P>
<P>
   Aging-related research has taken place for almost 50 years at
UF. Today, more than 350 faculty members are involved in
aging-related teaching and research.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said the institute will coordinate research activity and
provide resources for faculty. The center also will identify areas
of aging-related research and education that UF should study. Then
it will recruit faculty to build those programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nowhere in the country that has the potential we have
at the University of Florida,'' said Dwyer, a professor and head of
the division of aging in the College of Medicine's department of
health policy and epidemiology. ``We're in the state of Florida,
where 19 percent of the population is age 65 or older. And other
states around the country are looking to the state of Florida as
the example of what they're going to be in the next 10, 15 or 20
years.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ With a mother's anger and a mother's fear, Gou Qinghui
displayed the empty green folder that is supposed to hold her baby
boy's birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so unfair to the child,'' she said, describing how
hospital officials last month handed her the folder without the
vital document inside. The officials at the Beijing Medical
University No. 3 Hospital told her they could not issue a birth
certificate for Xiao Xuya, born on Sept. 3, but they refused to
tell her why.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gou, 37 and a devout Christian, is pretty certain why. Since
she was removed from her teaching post at the government-controlled
Yanjing Theological Seminary in 1994, she has thrown herself into
the illegal ``house church'' movement _ Protestants who worship in
homes and other locations, rejecting the authority of the official
church. She was recently threatened with arrest for her religious
work.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, her husband, Xiao Biguang, also 37 and a
Christian, tried in the early 1990s to combine his religious
principles with political activism. In 1994, after he helped
organize a ``China Democratic Alliance,'' he was arrested and held
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release in 1997, Xiao has stayed clear of politics, he
says, but has lived in what the couple refer to as soft
imprisonment _ under close police scrutiny and without any
identification papers, which means he cannot travel or hold a job.
</P>
<P>
   So both parents are used to living with official intimidation.
But even they have been shocked by the crude effort to hold hostage
their baby's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm most worried about is getting papers for my child,''
Ms. Gou said. ``If we don't get the right document from the
hospital, then we can't go to the police station to register the
child and get him listed on our Beijing residence certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without documents he won't be able to do anything,'' she said,
drawing the parallel with her husband's current limbo. ``He won't
be able to go to school, and later on he won't be able to find
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiao added: ``Even if the two of us have our backgrounds, that
shouldn't threaten our baby. He's an innocent victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month and a half the parents have made repeated
inquiries about the birth certificate at the hospital and with the
Haidian district police but have been constantly rebuffed, leading
them to take the risky step of discussing their problem with a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Their experience is in some fashion shared by thousands of
political and religious dissidents here. Most are largely unknown
in China or abroad, and most will never be sent away for long terms
in labor camps or prisons. But many _ often without even the
pretense of legal procedures _ must endure constant harassment by
the local police, including threats to the welfare of their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a state-owned apartment is taken away, sometimes a job
or crucial identification papers. Often the mere threat of such
sanctions is enough to keep people quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For this couple, who married in 1991, the hostage birth
certificate is the latest in a series of troubles that began with
Xiao's 1994 arrest. At the time, Ms. Gou was a Bible teacher at the
official seminary in Beijing although, she admits, she also worked
``a little'' with the house churches.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's arrest, Ms. Gou was relieved of all duties
at the seminary, but continued to draw her salary. ``Their attitude
was, just take the money and don't bother to come around here,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has never joined her husband in political activities, she
says, although she was detained for hours once in 1995 after she
signed a petition calling for a reappraisal of the crushed student
democracy movement of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Forced out of the official seminary, Ms. Gou became more deeply
involved with house churches, which are said to meet at hundreds of
small sites around Beijing. Adherents say these sites draw far more
worshipers than the handful of large official churches, which are
crowded by thousands of residents each Sunday. While illegal, most
of the meetings are known to the authorities, who keep close watch
and sometimes move in to fine or arrest the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my work in the movement is as a simple preacher and
organizer,'' Ms. Gou said. By last spring, she was apparently seen
as a threat and on April 5, the police came to her house with
arrest papers.
</P>
<P>
   But she was more than five months pregnant at the time, and she
and her husband argued that she was still a legally approved
religious worker, citing her continuing affiliation with the
seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The police left. On April 20, the Yanjing Theological Seminary
issued a new document, formally expelling her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a political activist, I'm just interested in
spreading the Gospel,'' Ms. Gou said. With her baby born and her
last connection with the official church severed, she does not know
if or when those police will return. For now, she just wants her
baby to get his papers.

VIACOM REPORTS HIGHER EARNINGS, SAYS IT STILL PLANS BLOCKBUSTER
SPIN OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman and chief executive of Viacom,
said Thursday that the company would stick with its plans to spin
off Blockbuster, the video rental company, to shareholders early in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a sick child,'' Redstone said of Blockbuster during
a conference call with analysts and reporters to discuss Viacom's
quarterly earnings. ``It is a booming, thriving business.''
</P>
<P>
   Viacom sold a 17.7 percent stake in Blockbuster in an initial
public offering in August and said then that it would sell most of
the company to shareholders next year. But recent reports suggested
that Melvin A. Karmazin, the chief executive of CBS who will be
president and chief operating officer when Viacom merges with CBS,
was considering not splitting off Blockbuster. Any such
disagreement would be the first corporate contretemps between the
two executives in the initial stages of the proposed Viacom-CBS
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's third quarter was strong except for a few expected
losses in the entertainment and parks division. The company
reported Thursday that net earnings for the third quarter were up
28 percent, to $111 million, or $16 cents a diluted share. Net
earnings for the corresponding period in 1998 were $86 million, or
10 cents a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flow _ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization _ was $610 million for the quarter, up from $600
million. For the nine months that ended Sept. 30, net earnings from
continuing operations rose to $239 million, or 32 cents a diluted
common share, from a net loss of $133 million, or 25 cents a
diluted common share, for the nine-month period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV Networks group posted 22 percent earnings growth, to
$285.1 million, for the quarter, and the video division, 25
percent, to $129.9 million. Earnings at the entertainment division
_ which includes Paramount Pictures _ were down 55 percent to $95.7
million, from $214.7 million; that loss was attributed largely to
the revenue earned last year by the movie ``Titanic'' at the box
office and in home-release formats. Paramount amusement parks
posted a loss of 7 percent, to $67.5 million, because of inclement
weather conditions around the country this year, Redstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom shares gained 6.25 cents Thursday, to $41.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts saw no surprises in the quarterly earnings. Tom
Wolzien, a senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.,
said: ``As long as the economy keeps going, these guys keep going.
They are driven by MTV Networks. Showtime continues to do well,
thanks to satellite. The studio has had its ups and down, but in
the last few years they have done a great job, cutting good deals
and not taking too many risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, Wolzien said, ``will continue for a few years and
then it becomes a `who knows?' situation.'' Analysts expect that
video-on-demand _ digitized versions of movies that can be
downloaded to consumer television sets _ will hurt the video-rental
market.

CAMPBELL NEARS DECISION ON WHETHER TO SEEK SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell, nearing a decision on whether to
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year, says he
doubts his vote to impeach President Clinton would hurt him in an
state-wide election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see it as a problem,'' says Campbell, 47, a
softspoken Stanford University law school professor who is expected
to announce as early as next week whether he will seek the
Republican nomination to run for Feinstein's seat. ``The matter has
evaporated, except for the occasional compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, defending his impeachment vote last year, says he has
a clear standard for whether a politician is worthy of holding
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an individual intentionally did not tell the truth'' to a
federal grand jury, that ``incapacitates'' that person from holding
political office, Campbell said in an interview in his Capitol Hill
office earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A 4th-term Republican House member known for breaking with his
party occasionally, Campbell says he applied the same standard to
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and refused to back him as
speaker after Gingrich admitted submitting inaccurate information
to the House Ethics Committee. Campbell later joined an attempt to
oust Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a staunch conservative who
shares a love of Irish pub music with Campbell and refers to the
two of them and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., as the ``Tres
Amigos,'' says Campbell's support for gun control and abortion
rights will ``keep many conservatives away.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he's convinced California voters want a Senate
candidate who votes conservatively on fiscal issue and moderately
on social issues _ and that's how he describes himself.
</P>
<P>
   While Campbell might not be the top choice for conservatives in
the primary, he would be in the general election, Rohrabacher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once conservatives understand the general thrust that Tom
Campbell has had in Washington, they will have no trouble
supporting him over Dianne Feinstein,'' Campbell says.
</P>
<P>
   If Campbell runs, he would contend for the Republican nomination
with at least four conservatives _ Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron
Unz, State Senate Minority Whip Ray Haynes, San Diego County
Supervisor Bill Horn, and businessman J.P. Gough.
</P>
<P>
   Unz would likely present the strongest challenge to Campbell,
according to John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont
McKenna College.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney says Unz ``is one of the few people in the state of
California who is as smart as Tom Campbell. These are two of the
smartest guys in politics today. It would be good for the state to
see that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell would face a steep fund-raising challenge to raise the
estimated $5 million needed for the primary and $20 million needed
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The state-wide Field Poll, released Thursday, showed Feinstein
with a huge lead over Campbell and other potential Republican
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters in a hypothetical general election, Feinstein
won 55 percent of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Campbell had a tiny lead other possible
Republican nominees in matchups against Feinstein. Unz came in
second, winning 26 percent against Feinstein's 59 percent. Unz was
the prime mover behind the voter-approved Proposition 227 last
year, which put strict limits on bilingual education in state
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Field poll was conducted Oct. 8-17 among 514 likely voters,
with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders and Republican members of Congress confirm that
Campbell has discussed with them whether he should make the run.
However, Campbell dodges questions about his plans and refuses to
compare his record to Feinstein's, saying it is premature to do so.
</P>

CAMPBELL NEARS DECISION ON WHETHER TO SEEK SENATE SEAT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell, nearing a decision on whether to
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year, says he
doubts his vote to impeach President Clinton would hurt him in an
state-wide election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see it as a problem,'' says Campbell, 47, a
softspoken Stanford University law school professor who is expected
to announce as early as next week whether he will seek the
Republican nomination to run for Feinstein's seat. ``The matter has
evaporated, except for the occasional compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, defending his impeachment vote last year, says he has
a clear standard for whether a politician is worthy of holding
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an individual intentionally did not tell the truth'' to a
federal grand jury, that ``incapacitates'' that person from holding
political office, Campbell said in an interview in his Capitol Hill
office earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A 4th-term Republican House member known for breaking with his
party occasionally, Campbell says he applied the same standard to
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and refused to back him as
speaker after Gingrich admitted submitting inaccurate information
to the House Ethics Committee. Campbell later joined an attempt to
oust Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a staunch conservative who
shares a love of Irish pub music with Campbell and refers to the
two of them and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., as the ``Tres
Amigos,'' says Campbell's support for gun control and abortion
rights will ``keep many conservatives away.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he's convinced California voters want a Senate
candidate who votes conservatively on fiscal issue and moderately
on social issues _ and that's how he describes himself.
</P>
<P>
   While Campbell might not be the top choice for conservatives in
the primary, he would be in the general election, Rohrabacher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once conservatives understand the general thrust that Tom
Campbell has had in Washington, they will have no trouble
supporting him over Dianne Feinstein,'' Campbell says.
</P>
<P>
   If Campbell runs, he would contend for the Republican nomination
with at least four conservatives _ Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron
Unz, State Senate Minority Whip Ray Haynes, San Diego County
Supervisor Bill Horn, and businessman J.P. Gough.
</P>
<P>
   Unz would likely present the strongest challenge to Campbell,
according to John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont
McKenna College.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney says Unz ``is one of the few people in the state of
California who is as smart as Tom Campbell. These are two of the
smartest guys in politics today. It would be good for the state to
see that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell would face a steep fund-raising challenge to raise the
estimated $5 million needed for the primary and $20 million needed
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The state-wide Field Poll, released Thursday, showed Feinstein
with a huge lead over Campbell and other potential Republican
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters in a hypothetical general election, Feinstein
won 55 percent of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Campbell had a tiny lead other possible
Republican nominees in matchups against Feinstein. Unz came in
second, winning 26 percent against Feinstein's 59 percent. Unz was
the prime mover behind the voter-approved Proposition 227 last
year, which put strict limits on bilingual education in state
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Field poll was conducted Oct. 8-17 among 514 likely voters,
with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders and Republican members of Congress confirm that
Campbell has discussed with them whether he should make the run.
However, Campbell dodges questions about his plans and refuses to
compare his record to Feinstein's, saying it is premature to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wise for me to make a decision and then go
forward _ as opposed to discussing it before the decision,'' he
said.

<P>
   Last spring, after dissing Japan for most of the 1990s, I said
it was time to dip at least a toe, and perhaps even a left leg,
into Japanese equities. Since then, the Nikkei index has climbed
more than 30 percent, and choice stocks like Sony have surged more
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has arrived for a couple of reasons. First, the prices
of Japanese assets finally fell enough to make Japanese firms look
attractive to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital bought Japan Leasing, for example. Japanese firms
have started to see value in one another, too (in August, three of
Japan's biggest banks revealed their intention to merge). By late
spring, professional money managers in New York and London were
realizing they owned hardly any Japanese shares.
</P>
<P>
   Too many portfolio managers running international funds had
slipped up in 1998 by staying away from South Korea as that stock
market roared ahead, and they couldn't afford to make the same
mistake this year. So they have jumped into the Nikkei and driven
it up.
</P>
<P>
   A second transformation has helped matters. Government
bureaucrats _ those stuffy, overeducated drones at the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(MITI) _ have finally been defanged and are now losing turf wars.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the MOF fought against tax cuts (it even raised the
sales tax in the midst of a decade-long recession). But recently
the MOF capitulated, and Japan's corporate tax rate was cut by 3.62
percentage points; individual tax rates have come down, too.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians have been happy to publicly savage the MOF, even
stripping the bureau of its name, soon to be known as the Ministry
of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   To Westerners, this may sound like no big deal, but to MOF
veterans it's like changing Yankee Stadium to Yonkers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   MITI, which had been overregulating trade and industry, has
softened in its resistance to foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, when Japanese firms bought everything from
Columbia Pictures to Rockefeller Center, American managers were
seen as lazy, bumbling barbarians. Presidents of American firms
that had been taken over had to fly to Tokyo regularly for
humiliating boardroom meetings conducted entirely in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans are the cavalry, teaching the Japanese how to
compete and innovate in an economy based on software, patents, and
information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   This year MITI permitted Sumitomo Rubber Industries to form a
global partnership with Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive young company named Softbank owns a big piece of
Yahoo but doesn't meddle in the American company's affairs.
Instead, Softbank tries to create new business opportunities and
joint ventures for Yahoo. Yahoo is not a slave to Softbank; it's a
jewel that Softbank helps polish.
</P>
<P>
   Can this good news continue, or will the sluggish Japanese
economy drag the market back into the mire it has been stuck in
since its 1989 peak? (Remember, the Nikkei still hovers at less
than half of what it was worth ten years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   I am mostly optimistic. Sure, dangers remain. But stock prices
will continue to rise, despite occasional weeks of doubt that will
scare off some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Fiefdoms are being carved up. Government bureaucrats must answer
to the electorate. Corporate chieftains must answer to the
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The arrogance of the 1980s is being replaced by modesty. Japan
Inc. no longer aims to utterly dominate the world economy _ in
fact, there is no Japan Inc. anymore.
</P>
<P>
   While that frightens older Japanese workers, coddled by promises
of lifetime employment and protection from foreign competitors,
younger Japanese welcome the challenge and the opportunities in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   So should investors. &QL;

<P>
   A young New York financial-services employee recently learned
his promotion would not be final until he visited a luxurious
clinic. There doctors gave him a comprehensive medical
questionnaire, urine and blood tests, an EKG, and a psychiatric
session that included much role-playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood why they did all that,'' he says. ``I was
being promoted from within, It wasn't like I was a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Such invasions of our medical privacy are becoming more common,
and it may get worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been struggling with the creation of privacy
legislation to prevent the misuse of ``unique health identifiers,''
which function sort of like Social Security numbers. These numbers
aren't yet in place, but were mandated by the 1996
Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill.
</P>
<P>
   Without an identifier, theoretically, no American would be able
to consume medical care, even if paying cash.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates would prefer that Washington just stay
out of it. They fear that any federal laws in the area of medical
privacy are likely to codify current privacy-eroding practices and
prevent, or preempt, states from passing stronger laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preemption is where the game's at now,'' says Boston
psychiatrist Denise Nagel of the National Coalition for Patient
Rights. ``All the industry groups want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Says American Psychiatric Association vice president Paul
Appelbaum: ``You've got people in Montana with rifles scanning the
sky for black helicopters, while the real threat to their liberty
is in Washington, where powerful efforts are under way to construct
a national health-care data bank that would list all their medical
encounters from birth to death.''
</P>
<P>
   You needn't live in Montana to feel threatened. In fact, a
Harris poll conducted last year by corporate privacy expert Alan
Westin found that, of those earning at least $75,000 a year, 56
percent _ more than in any other group _ strongly agreed that
``consumers have lost all control over how personal information is
circulated and used by companies.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Westin says, is because the wealthiest understand the new
information technology that is beginning to drive American life.
</P>
<P>
   They know that receiving a flyer from a pharmacy reminding you
to take your cholesterol medication is nothing compared with being
turned down for a million-dollar mortgage or terrific job because
some backroom functionary concluded you're at risk for a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Gellman, a privacy consultant and former
Capitol Hill staffer, personal medical information is daily
becoming more easily available and more attractive to such users as
employers, lenders, health plans, government and law-enforcement
officials, researchers, drug companies, data miners, and online
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Take Heatheon, Netscape co-founder Jim Clark's new company. An
electronic service for payers, doctors, and hospitals, Healtheon
claims that centralizing medical data will ultimately benefit the
patient by offering consumers ``vaults'' that can receive direct
reports of medical purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Employment may be the most sensitive area of concern. University
of Illinois political-science professor David Linowes was the chair
of a privacy commission under Presidents Ford and Carter, and since
1979, he and his co-researcher, Ray Spencer, have been asking
Fortune 500 companies if they use medical data in employment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the respondents answered yes in the last
survey, in 1996, and Linowes says that applicants can consider
themselves very likely to undergo such scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A human-resources manager can't legally examine a prospect's
medical record without consent. But she may easily be able to view
the prospect's records of insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   The manager might even obtain an executive's medical record,
Linowes says, by hiring an investigative service that either tricks
or pays someone in the doctor's office to reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator can also comb data banks that offer personal
information on cancer, hospitalizations, and medications.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't move to New Zealand, which Gellman says has great
privacy laws, here are some strategies for managing your medical
privacy:
</P>
<P>
   _ Appelbaum suggests telling a doctor: ``I have concerns about
my medical-record information being spread around, and I know
there's no certain way of protecting information once it gets into
the records. I'd like to share my information with you to get care,
but I'd like your assurance you will work to keep personal and
potentially embarrassing information out of my record.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Harold Bursztajn, of the Harvard Medical School, says a
home-based private practice is best for psychiatric care. Don't use
insurance if you can afford not to. Understand that if you take
psychiatric medication, or any other prescription, you have left an
electronic trail. He advises making an agreement with all your
doctors that no information leaves their offices without your
review and consent. Caveat: A call for records from a health plan
to which you gave blanket consent when you enrolled could override
that agreement.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a post-job-offer medical screening, the worst thing to do
is lie, says Manhattan benefits attorney Richard G. Schwartz. That
can be a larger factor in losing a position or promotion than even
a serious health problem. ``You've got to be careful what you say,
and employers have to careful what they ask,'' says Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   _ In genetic tests for diseases, ``be extraordinarily careful,''
says Appelbaum. ``Few genetic tests will lead to useful
intervention, and patients should ask themselves and their doctors
what the justification is. Doctors get excited about new tests, but
patients should wait until there's a clear benefit for themselves
and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   _ When at work, stay off medically-oriented Web sites. ``Many
companies log where employees go online, and unusual activity is
looked at,'' says computer scientist Jason Catlett of Junkbusters,
a Web site that helps people protect their online privacy. Assume
that any information you give to a Web site is not private.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, it's corny but true: Contact your elected officials
about your concerns. Says political scientist Richard Sobel, ``If
we had reasonable policies, people would not have to be privacy
guerrillas.'' &QL;

<P>
   A young New York financial-services employee recently learned
his promotion would not be final until he visited a luxurious
clinic. There doctors gave him a comprehensive medical
questionnaire, urine and blood tests, an EKG, and a psychiatric
session that included much role-playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood why they did all that,'' he says. ``I was
being promoted from within, It wasn't like I was a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Such invasions of our medical privacy are becoming more common,
and it may get worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been struggling with the creation of privacy
legislation to prevent the misuse of ``unique health identifiers,''
which function sort of like Social Security numbers. These numbers
aren't yet in place, but were mandated by the 1996
Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill.
</P>
<P>
   Without an identifier, theoretically, no American would be able
to consume medical care, even if paying cash.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer advocates would prefer that Washington just stay
out of it. They fear that any federal laws in the area of medical
privacy are likely to codify current privacy-eroding practices and
prevent, or preempt, states from passing stronger laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preemption is where the game's at now,'' says Boston
psychiatrist Denise Nagel of the National Coalition for Patient
Rights. ``All the industry groups want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Says American Psychiatric Association vice president Paul
Appelbaum: ``You've got people in Montana with rifles scanning the
sky for black helicopters, while the real threat to their liberty
is in Washington, where powerful efforts are under way to construct
a national health-care data bank that would list all their medical
encounters from birth to death.''
</P>
<P>
   You needn't live in Montana to feel threatened. In fact, a
Harris poll conducted last year by corporate privacy expert Alan
Westin found that, of those earning at least $75,000 a year, 56
percent _ more than in any other group _ strongly agreed that
``consumers have lost all control over how personal information is
circulated and used by companies.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Westin says, is because the wealthiest understand the new
information technology that is beginning to drive American life.
</P>
<P>
   They know that receiving a flyer from a pharmacy reminding you
to take your cholesterol medication is nothing compared with being
turned down for a million-dollar mortgage or terrific job because
some backroom functionary concluded you're at risk for a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Gellman, a privacy consultant and former
Capitol Hill staffer, personal medical information is daily
becoming more easily available and more attractive to such users as
employers, lenders, health plans, government and law-enforcement
officials, researchers, drug companies, data miners, and online
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Take Heatheon, Netscape co-founder Jim Clark's new company. An
electronic service for payers, doctors, and hospitals, Healtheon
claims that centralizing medical data will ultimately benefit the
patient by offering consumers ``vaults'' that can receive direct
reports of medical purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Employment may be the most sensitive area of concern. University
of Illinois political-science professor David Linowes was the chair
of a privacy commission under Presidents Ford and Carter, and since
1979, he and his co-researcher, Ray Spencer, have been asking
Fortune 500 companies if they use medical data in employment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the respondents answered yes in the last
survey, in 1996, and Linowes says that applicants can consider
themselves very likely to undergo such scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A human-resources manager can't legally examine a prospect's
medical record without consent. But she may easily be able to view
the prospect's records of insurance claims.
</P>
<P>

DEMOCRATS STEP UP EFFORT TO PAINT REPUBLICANS AS ISOLATIONISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear Democrats tell it, Republicans want America
to turn its back on allies abroad and minorities at home.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the White House and Democrats stepped up their effort
to paint the congressional majority as dangerous isolationists on
foreign policy issues and as ``anti-minority'' on domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives counter that presidential politics is afoot as
the administration seeks to cover up its legislative defeats with
baseless accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national security
adviser, planned a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations
late Thursday where he said ``the new isolationists'' are no longer
a fringe element but a dominate force in the Republican majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's address, heavily promoted by the White House, came a
day after Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., stopped just
shy of accusing Republicans of racism for their insensitivity to
minority concerns. The White House earlier voiced the same theme on
race and isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the dual accusations were an attempt to counter Texas
Republican Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism''
slogan, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart responded, ``the one
person who has been absent in this debate is the author of
compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, Bush's presidential campaign spokeswoman,
responded, ``These ongoing attacks from the president, the vice
president and the president's spokesman must indicate that Governor
Bush's positive and hopeful message is resonating with people of
all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson said: ``They are
essentially saying that we're racists. That's outrageous. There's
no place for racism in America or in American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Democrats cite a series of examples. On
isolationism, they point to the Senate defeat of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, Congress' refusal to pay back dues owed the United
Nations, Congress' refusal to pay the United States' funding pledge
for the Middle East peace process and Republicans' refusal to
approve U.S. military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On race issues, they point to attempts to eliminate bilingual
education, limit immigration, the Senate's slow action on minority
and women judicial nominees, and the fight over a banking bill that
would curtail laws barring ``redlining'' in minority areas.
</P>
<P>
   They also cite the effort by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to stop
the nomination of former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., the
first black woman to serve in the Senate, as ambassador to New
Zealand. And, they cite the Senate's rare defeat of a federal
judicial nominee, Ronnie White, the first black man to serve on the
Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And, an example of both accusations merging, they point to Rep.
Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, who suggested this week that
``everytime somebody walks in the White House with a turban on his
head'' the president offers them money. Callahan added he was going
to ``buy me one of those turbans'' and seek money for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Bush should get involved in these issues ``because
sitting on the sidelines, he's not moving the ball one way or the
other. If he sides with Senator Helms and he sides with
Representative Callahan on these issues, if he has a problem with
people who wear turbans, he ought to step up and say he does. If he
doesn't, he ought to step up and say it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a government expert with the conservative
Heritage Foundation, said the Democrats' accusations must be ``seen
in the context of the 2000 campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Democrats' charges of isolationism and racism are
attempts to cover their policy defeats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of a legislative legacy, the White House right
now is trying to gain a partisan advantage. Ultimately, the
administration views its legacy as retaining the White House and
regaining Congress,'' Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reacted angrily to Daschle's remarks, accusing him
of engaging in race-based politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words like this only serve to open old wounds, not heal them.
If they are accusing anyone, they should name them,'' said John
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle defended his accusations, saying, ``There is a pattern
here that I think is very, very disconcerting. That was my only
point. It creates the perception that there is some very serious
questions relating to sensitivity towards minorities that continue
to come up with each and every one of these new incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   He again denied accusing Republicans of racism. ``All I'm saying
is that this continued pattern creates the perception that I think
is dangerous for society and is dangerous in our efforts to try to
progress as we have for the last several decades with regard to the
minority rights and the minority opportunity in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the Council on Foreign Relations, Berger's
prepared text blasted Republicans for becoming ``new
isolationists'' who seek to hunker down at the very moment the
nation is at its wealthiest and most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, they believe in a survivalist foreign policy: build
a fortified fence around America and retreat behind it. And if
other nations complain that we're abdicating our responsibilities _
or if they start abdicating their own _ let them, because we are
stronger and richer than they are,'' according to an advanced text
provided by the White House.

gradually unveils his plan to overhaul public education, an issue
Republican leaders believe they bungled in 1996 and one that Bush
is anxious to reclaim for his party.
</P>
<P>
   Among others sources, Bush has borrowed from the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, and from an April paper
written by Andrew J. Rotherham, an education expert who took a
leave from the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think tank
close to President Clinton, to work at the White House as an
education advisor.
</P>
<P>
   At the Institute, Rotherham worked the Heritage Foundation and
other groups to broker a compromise on how best to use federal
education dollars to help poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers understand that education is a potent
issue, capable of moving a wide swath of voters, especially women.
In 1996, Republicans were reeling from the gender gap _ female
voters' support of Democrats over Republicans. That year, men voted
almost evenly for Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole, while 54
percent of women voted Democratic compared with 38 percent
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and others talked about strategies to close the gap at a
post-mortem Republican governors held in Michigan. Bush said the
party must recast its education message, then largely centered on
abolishing the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that from a political perspective, he
(President Clinton) stole the issue and it affected the women's
vote,'' Bush said in 1996. ``But holding out the idea that the
federal government can solve the problems of education is wrong. We
should have challenged him on it. ... Republicans must say we're
for education.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Jennings, director of the Center on Education Policy, said
Bush has abandoned the hostile tone Republicans used when they
discussed public education. Instead, he proposes to link federal
dollars to better academic performance and to allow poor parents
whose children are in low-performing schools to use federal money
to pay for alternatives to public education. Critics have attacked
that proposal as a back door voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly set about trying to prove to the public that the
Republicans will improve public schools while nodding to the far
right, 'Well, if that doesn't happen, we'll go to vouchers,'''
Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education ideas are not new, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bush is drawing on is stuff that has been in the policy
mill for awhile,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not proposed an infusion of new money for the public
schools. Instead, in two of three planned education speeches, he
put forward a plan to restructure the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
1965, the act provides nearly $14 billion to public schools each
year, their largest source of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chuck _ $9.9 billion in Title 1 money _ goes to
boost the performance of the nation's poorest students. On
Thursday, the House voted to approve a bipartisan plan to
reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. An effort
by House Majority Leader Dick Armey to attach a voucher provision
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics from all sides of the ideological spectrum have
questioned whether Title I dollars are buying better performance.
Rotherham's April article proposes shrinking the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act's 60 areas into a handful of block grants.
A similar approach is central to the plan Bush announced in New
York earlier this month. Under both plans, school districts would
have to prove that federal money was buying better academic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Bush's plan would use the National Assessment in
Education Progress, an exam given to a sample of students. Third-
through eighth-graders would be tested annually in reading and math
as a way of auditing progress from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   Rotherham also suggests using the NAEP test in the absence of a
voluntary national test in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade
math, a Clinton proposal that was anathema to conservates and died
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the similarities, Bush's plan departs significantly from
Rotherham's, said Bruce Reed, chief-domestic policy advisor at the
White House. The Clinton adminstration has a separate plan that
also emphasizes accountability, but does not use block grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is borrowing some of the rhetoric and looking for the
cover of new Democratic ideas, but going in a different
direction,'' Reed said. ``He's put together a voucher plan but
refused to say the word voucher. His emphasis on standards and
accountability resembles the Clinton agenda, but the fundamental
breaking point is over vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the administration hasn't pushed Rotherham's plan,
Reed called it, ``an interesting one,'' and said that the plans
share an emphasis on school accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also takes a page from a Heritage Foundation proposal that
would allow states to free themselves from virtually all federal
restrictions if they agree to meet particularly rigorous academic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Shokraii Rees, an education expert at the Heritage
Foundation, calls Bush's plan, ``very conservative'' and
Rotherham's plan, ``avant-garde and innovative.'' And a year of
``triangulation'' and other political ironies, the latest one
hasn't escaped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is not pushing the plan that this special
assistant to the president thought of,'' she said, ``whereas the
Republican frontrunner is.''

SCIENTISTS FIND ENZYME LINKED TO ALZHEIMER'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long, brutal process that leads to Alzheimer's disease
starts when a single enzyme snips a protein that protrudes from
brain cells, leading to the release of toxic shards. Now scientists
report that they have found that enzyme, opening the door to
developing drugs that might block it and _ if the drugs prove safe
_ prevent or slow the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the enzyme had eluded teams of scientists at
universities and drug companies for more than a decade, though they
had given it a name, beta-secretase. So many false claims of
victory were announced that investigators automatically doubted
anyone who claimed to have found it.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that the new work, by Dr. Martin Citron and his
colleagues at Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks,
Calif., is different _ that it passes crucial tests of
authenticity, convincing even some skeptics. The report appears in
Friday's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sangram Sisodia, chairman of the department of neurobiology,
pharmacology and physiology at the University of Chicago, said that
when he first heard of the Amgen result, he dismissed it, saying,
``It's junk. It has been junk after junk for 12 years.'' But he
added, ``When I read the paper, I was overwhelmed. The set of
experiments in this paper was a tour de force.''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm was shared by other scientists, also not
connected with the study. ``We now have a target, an identified
target for drug development,'' said Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, a professor
of neurology at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, Citron said, is that such a drug might stop the
progress of Alzheimer's disease in a person who has it, or even
prevent it in those likely to develop it. Still, Citron and other
scientists emphasized that the development of a drug was still
years away and that its success could not be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With the beta-secretase discovery, several scientists said, the
field of Alzheimer's research is poised at the same place as AIDS
research several years ago, when scientists discovered that the
AIDS virus needed a protease _ an enzyme that cuts protein _ to
replicate.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies seized on that discovery, searching for compounds
to block the HIV protease. Now protease inhibitors are on the
market and are a vital part of AIDS therapy. Beta-secretase is also
a protease, and its method of cutting is similar to the method of
the HIV protease.
</P>
<P>
   ``With beta-secretase, the field of Alzheimer's research has now
been granted the same opportunity that AIDS researchers were
granted,'' Tanzi said. ``This is as exciting for Alzheimer's
research as the HIV protease enzyme was for AIDS research.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Relkin, an Alzheimer's specialist at the
Weill-Cornell Medical Center in New York, said there was no doubt
about the potential unleashed by the discovery. ``This is one of
the long-sought-after holy grails of Alzheimer's research,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Alzheimer's disease, brain cells die, slowly and inexorably,
as patients gradually lose their memories, their judgment, their
ability to balance a checkbook or find their way around their
neighborhoods or even their own homes. And as patients' minds
crumble, areas of their brains that control memory and reasoning
and judgment are covered with an accumulation of microscopic balls
of debris, known as amyloid, mostly made up of aggregations of a
protein fragment called A beta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us, and most of the big pharmaceutical companies,
agree that if you figure out a way of getting rid of amyloid, you
will have a good drug for Alzheimer's disease,'' Tanzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, scientists have learned that A beta is a small
piece of a much larger protein that protrudes from cells. It can be
created when the beta-secretase clips the protein in two and then
another enzyme, gamma-secretase, snips the resulting protein
fragments, creating one piece that is the toxic A beta protein and
another that is a harmless piece of protein debris.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, scientists could stop A beta production by blocking
either the beta- or the gamma-secretase. But both enzymes were
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there are multiple proteases, and in
making cell extracts, you release all of the proteases,'' Citron
said. ``It is very hard to sort out which are relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Several large drug companies decided to go ahead anyway, even
without the beta-secretase or the gamma-secretase in hand. Instead,
they studied cells in the laboratory that released A beta protein
and looked for drugs that would prevent the substance from being
released.
</P>
<P>
   Citron and his colleagues decided to take a different tack _ to
look for the gene that directs cells to make beta-secretase. In a
long and tedious set of experiments that began in 1997, they began
a process of progressive elimination, searching first for a string
of about 100 genes that contained the one they wanted, then
narrowing the gene strings down to batches of 20 and, finally,
homing in on the gene. With the gene in hand, they could use it to
make the enzyme and show that the enzyme cut the large precursor
protein at exactly the right spot and at no other spot.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen is now looking for compounds that can block the beta
secretase. Citron cautioned that it would be several years before a
potential drug is found and tested sufficiently in the laboratory
and in animals that the company is ready to initiate tests with
people.
</P>
<P>
   Relkin, of the Weill-Cornell center, said it was impossible to
predict how soon such a drug could be developed. But he added, ``It
is certainly exciting to be able to ask these questions.''

COMMENTARY: THE DEADLY CARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More often now, the special cargo arrives in China from Israel _
files from Israeli military computers, crates with the makings of
missiles and other weapons, and the men in the lab coats, the
engineers and scientists who know how to put it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Many other countries send that kind of cargo purchased by the
Chinese for the same reason, clearly understood by the vendors _ to
add to the accuracy, skills and range of the Communists' armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is _ once again democracies, their friends and
beneficiaries are strengthening a dictatorship that governs by fear
and force. They do it for money.
</P>
<P>
   Then why focus this column on Israel's part? I do for the same
reason I focus often on U.S. help to dictatorships, military or
political.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is special, for me, for my family, for all
people who believe that peace in freedom is the bread and rose of
life. When America helps empower governments that destroy freedom
at home and abroad, it brings agony of body and soul to those who
fight for liberty. If the United States kneels to help tyrannies
for money, who will remain standing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel is also special to me, and to almost all Jews, under
whatever Israeli government, and to great numbers of Christians.
They see its creation as an act of enduring bravery and succor in a
wicked millennium, think of Israel as the only Mideastern democracy
and therefore an enemy of tyranny, and without embarrassment _
Christian friends particularly _ speak of it as rooted in
righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   So for years I have told Israeli prime ministers and diplomats,
of left and right, that military sales to China dim their country
as a lantern of democracy. I have written that Israel should not
sell a single pistol to China.
</P>
<P>
   The double standard by which Israel is often judged assumes that
Israel will not follow the dirty path to China's cash register. To
me the double standard is most often an honor.
</P>
<P>
   But about China, Israeli leaders reject it. They say they are
trying to dissuade Beijing from selling more arms to their Mideast
enemies, quite as if they believe the Politburo word, like
Americans. They say they need customers for armaments factories
they could not otherwise afford without them. I doubt that _
Israeli technology important to weapon making is already sold
elsewhere, and American experts tell me more could be sold in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And now I see the Chinese minister of defense, who is one of the
ranking Tiananmen killers, visits Israel. I read obsequious Israeli
speeches praising him and his government.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries talk openly about bigger arms deals in the
making. I learn that the Chinese have knit together Russian and
Israeli specialties. The Russians are converting Ilyushin planes
into the framework of U.S.-type flying command posts and will ship
them to Israel for long-range radar to be installed and meshed into
electronic intelligence systems.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a pistol. Nor are the Russian-made MiG-21s, which
the Chinese want Israel to ``upgrade'' _ meaning better able to
shoot down U.S. or Taiwanese planes.
</P>
<P>
   Selling arms technology to China _ however Israel chooses to
justify it _ carries no penalty from the United States. America has
become so much the prisoner of Beijing, selling high-powered
computers and missile-launch know-how, that it cannot denounce
other countries in the market. Israeli officials tartly point that
out.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1992 I wrote denying charges by the columnists Evans
and Novak that Israel was selling American-originated missile
equipment to China. I was right then. But with China's armed forces
snapping up so many varieties of Israeli military technology, what
journalists would be confident enough to deny transfer of U.S.
technology in the future?
</P>
<P>
   One day a U.S. administration will break out of China's prison.
Then Israel's sales to China will make it an American political
target _ a warning that comes from some of Israel's good friends in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   People like myself, friends without office, simply do not
believe that because America, Russia and other profit-driven
countries sell power to the Chinese Politburo, Israel should do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States will not stop first, then perhaps if Israel
does, it will be a light unto the nations.

FED LEARNS BARTENDERS ARE MORE POPULAR THAN BOUNCERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Alan Greenspan yesterday's hero?
</P>
<P>
   It was only eight months ago that Greenspan was on the cover of
Time as the most prominent member of ``The Committee to Save the
World,'' a man who had prevented a global economic meltdown by
reducing interest rates. Politicians fell all over themselves to
praise the Federal Reserve chairman while interpreting his
sometimes Delphic words as an endorsement of their views.
</P>
<P>
   But now his halo is slipping, and the muttering is increasing.
How dare he raise interest rates? Who is he to question the stock
market's valuation?
</P>
<P>
   William McChesney Martin Jr., the Fed chairman during the great
economic expansion of the 1950s and 1960s, once said that the role
of the Fed was ``to take away the punch bowl just when the party
gets going.'' Greenspan is learning what happens to Fed officials
who wait too long to try to grab the bowl. The revelers resent it.
</P>
<P>
   Deep into the longest peacetime recovery in American history,
business feels it has a right to continued economic growth more or
less forever. Deep into the biggest bull market ever, more and more
investors believe that 20 percent-plus annual stock market gains
are a birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, another generation of Fed officials learned
the same lesson. In 1929, the Fed had the gall to tell banks to
reduce lending to stock speculators. The stock market plunged, only
to rally after Charles Mitchell, the president of National City
Bank, a predecessor of today's Citibank, defied the Fed and said
lending would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell ``saved the day'' and averted calamity, said the
Financial Chronicle, a Wall Street publication. The Fed, it added,
``can act the part of a bull in a china shop and cause a lot of
destruction and damage, or, Samson-like, it can pull the whole
financial structure down about its head. But that is no reason why
it should not be checked in the attempt by those who would be
involved in the ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   That Fed quickly lost its nerve. The stock market rallied more
than 30 percent from the March lows brought on by the Fed's effort
to slow speculation. Then it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed face a difficult
situation now. There is scattered evidence that the economy is
slowing, and there is reason to believe that the current rate of
growth is overstated because it reflects inventory accumulation by
people and companies fearful of Year 2000 glitches. Both are
reasons not to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there is equally scattered evidence that
inflation is rising, and there is concern over the soaring current
account deficit. A failure to act could cause stock prices to rise
to completely unreasonable levels, making an eventual crash more
likely. Action, on the other hand, might scare jittery investors
and bring on a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Back when people remembered 1929, it was taken for granted that
the Fed should act to rein in a frothy stock market. It raised the
margin requirement _ the amount investors had to put down to buy
stocks _ when markets were high, and cut it when share prices were
depressed. The last change, from 65 percent to 50 percent in 1974,
came during a severe bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Because it no longer pays attention to margins, the Fed has
created the impression that stock prices are irrelevant and that
inflation is the only reason to apply economic brakes. Without
clear evidence of inflation, Greenspan risks losing popularity if
he keeps raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, the Fed backed down under attack from the
party crowd. Will Greenspan do the same?

SMALL CHEMICAL PLANTS NOT READY FOR Y2K, STUDY FINDS  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most small and medium-sized chemical businesses in Texas and
elsewhere are not yet prepared for problems related to the Y2K
computer bug, according to a Texas A&AMP;M survey released Thursday by
a U.S. Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential for accidents to jeopardize neighboring
communities, the committee's leaders urged the heads of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to alert state and local emergency-response agencies about
the finding.
</P>
<P>
   In another response to the A&AMP;M study, the nonprofit Center for
Y2K &AMP; Society called for a ``safety holiday'' _ a shutdown of
operations just before and after Jan. 1, 2000 _ to be ordered at
most chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some larger chemical companies have already indicated they were
planning or considering total or partial shutdowns around the New
Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug involves the inability of some computers and devices
containing computer chips to read the 2000 date correctly. Such
failures could cause malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   In many chemical plants _ as well as other manufacturing
facilities such as oil refineries _ computers and chip-containing
devices are involved in a wide array of production, monitoring and
safety activities.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by the Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety
Center of the the Texas Engineering Experiment Station, part of the
Texas A&AMP;M system. The center interviewed officials of 281 chemical
companies with 200 or fewer employees _ 82 businesses in Texas and
the rest in California, Kansas and New Jersey. They were not
identified in the report issued by the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey results:
</P>
<P>
   _ 86.5 percent of the firms are not completely prepared for Y2K
problems, while 4.1 percent thought a ``catastrophic event'' is the
worst possible consequence at their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ 85.6 percent have not coordinated their contingency plans for
Y2K-related emergencies with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ 79 percent had never previously been surveyed about their Y2K
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Experts' earlier assessments of Y2K preparedness in the chemical
industry were based on the assumption _ also common for other types
of businesses _ that larger companies were probably doing more to
fix vulnerable equipment and make contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large degree, that assumption has been confirmed
(regarding chemical producers and handlers) by this in-depth,
independent report,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of
the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the probability of a Y2K-related disruption is low, the
potential harm even one chemical accident can cause means we must
be especially vigilant,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the
panel's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   With so little time remaining before Jan. 1, O'Connor Center
director Sam Mannan said special emphasis now should be placed on
contingency planning at smaller chemical businesses. He is also an
associate professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&AMP;M
University.
</P>
<P>
   Norman L. Dean, executive director of the Center for Y2K &AMP;
Society, said the A&AMP;M study is ``a warning that small and
medium-sized chemical plants face increased risks of explosions,
leaks and fires resulting from Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mayhew, vice president for regulatory and technical affairs
at the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said a survey of its
member companies indicated a much higher level of readiness than
was found among those surveyed for the A&AMP;M report.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all CMA members have finished taking steps to make their
facilities ``Y2K-compliant,'' and all say they will be ready in
time, Mayhew said.
</P>
<P>
   But the association's members generally have more than 200
employees, he said, so it is likely the A&AMP;M survey mainly involved
non-member businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller chemical companies tend to make less use of automated _
and, therefore, Y2K-vulnerable _ systems, Mayhew said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the companies with fewer than 200 employees questioned for
the A&AMP;M study, 34.6 percent said they use Y2K-susceptible computers
to operate chemical processes, while 23.2 percent said they have
devices containing computer chips that might be vulnerable to the
bug.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical safety advocates have criticized state and federal
officials for failing to require corrective actions related to
possible Y2K problems. Instead, government agencies have emphasized
educational outreach programs, often conducted in collaboration
with trade groups like the CMA.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola's profit hits Wall Street target
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least for the moment, investors apparently think
the worst is over for Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Atlanta-based beverage company rose 3 percent
Thursday after it met analysts' expectations for third-quarter
earnings and posted its first growth in case sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coca-Cola earned 11 percent less than it did a year ago _
the fourth consecutive decline in quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $787 million, or 32 cents a share, compared
with $888 million, or 36 cents a share, in the same period last
year. Quarterly sales rose 9 percent to nearly $5.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an in-line quarter,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The earnings report shows signs the
business is stabilizing, but not accelerating at a dramatic rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analyst Douglas Lane said the company is on the
mend.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report, he said, ``confirms our thesis that the worst
is behind us regarding the impact of the recent global meltdown on
Coke's business, and that the key underlying fundamentals ... are
all improving.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts' comments generally mirrored those of Coca-Cola's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the trends are very encouraging,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive M. Douglas Ivester said in a statement. ``In the third
quarter, we sold more soft drinks than in any quarter in the
company's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the sales gains are modest, Ivester said, they
represent further evidence that economies in key markets around the
world are beginning to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this sets the stage for positive momentum for our
business looking forward,'' Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivester acknowledged the company has not been living up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past year has not been what the company's shareowners or
its management, most especially me, want or expect. Both our volume
and profit results and our stock price have disappointed us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke shares rose $1.56 1/4 Thursday to close at $54.31 1/4. For
the year, the stock has dropped 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, case sales rose 3.5 percent, reversing
volume declines in the two previous quarters. The third quarter's
increase was aided by the company's recent acquisition of Cadbury
Schweppes brands in 161 countries outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dramatic improvement in quarterly volume growth,
year over year,'' Conway said. He added, however, that the company
had a strong performance in ``two critical profit centers'' _
Germany and Japan _ where case sales rose 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where Coca-Cola products were the subject of a June
recall after being blamed for making nearly 250 Belgians sick, the
company said it is seeing steady improvements. It expects sales to
be at pre-recall levels by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, the recall cost the company an estimated
3 cents in after-tax earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   While overall case sales rose 3 percent in Europe, the company
said ``very difficult economic conditions'' in parts of Eastern
Europe and Russia continue to affect its performance.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, increasing retail prices in supermarkets have
hurt case sales this year. In the third quarter, however, volume
started to improve, rising 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, case sales increased 5 percent, although the
company is still facing economic challenges in Venezuela and
Colombia, where volume declined.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, analysts expect the company to report its
first earnings increase for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, for example, expects the company to earn 28 cents,
compared with 24 cents last year. But he remains ``cautious'' on
the stock in the short-term because he predicts that volume growth
will pick up only slightly in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, however, Conway believes the growth in case sales
will accelerate, leading to higher profits and stock prices. He
thinks the company will earn $1.50 per share next year, compared
with $1.29 this year. He predicts the stock price will rise to $75
by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lane believes the stock will appreciate between 10 percent and
20 percent over the next year, and more than 20 percent after that.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that in the summer of next year, the company will
start reaching its long-term goals of 7 percent to 8 percent volume
growth and 15 percent to 20 percent earnings-per-share growth.

 &HT;    Delta discussing Boston expansion
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is in talks to spend more than $300
million on a new terminal at Boston's Logan Airport, where it's
also considering adding flights to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta would use the new terminal to consolidate
its operations at Logan, the only airport served by the airline's
regular flights as well as its Delta Shuttle and Delta Express
units.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also may launch direct flights to Europe from Boston,
Chief Executive Leo Mullin said. Boston would become Delta's fourth
trans-Atlantic gateway, joining Atlanta, New York and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said Delta hopes to fly between Boston and four European
cities: Dublin, Ireland; Manchester, England; Rome; and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our domestic presence there, it's a very viable
gateway,'' said Mullin, a Massachusetts native who has run Delta
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on a new terminal have been under way for several months
between Delta and the Massachusetts Port Authority. Delta also is
in preliminary discussions about a new terminal at New York's
Kennedy International to replace the one it inherited from Pan Am
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals American and United also are upgrading facilities in New
York and Boston. The moves reflect hot competition for passenger
loyalties in the fragmented Northeast market, as well as the strain
of passenger growth on aging airport facilities. ``It's the
strongest and most contested air market in the nation,'' Delta
spokesman John Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta holds its annual shareholder meeting next week in Boston
and may use the occasion to tout its Logan plans. But talks may not
move fast enough for an announcement next week.
</P>
<P>
   A MassPort spokeswoman said the talks have been ``very
productive'' but declined to comment further. The agency is already
is in the midst of a $1 billion modernization at Logan, which last
year handled 26.5 million passengers. It includes a controversial
proposal for a new runway.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's Logan project would cost about $386 million, with Delta
footing about $336 million of the bill, according to the airline.
Work is likely to start no sooner than 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involves replacing or redeveloping Terminal A, where
Delta Shuttle flights now operate. Other Delta flights operate from
Terminal C. Delta has 74 daily departures from Logan and flies
hourly between Boston and Atlanta. In recent years it has bulked up
schedules to major cities in the East, and its last new terminal
project was in Cincinnati.

SPORTS COLUMN: EL DUQUE DESERVES TO OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees were a coin, its motto would be ``In El Duque We
Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Orlando Hernandez will be starting two games in a
row after pitching the Yankees to the American League pennant last
Monday night in Boston and even though he has been pounded by the
Braves in his only two starts against them, the Cuban right-hander
known as El Duque will open the World Series Saturday night in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The more renowned Yankee starters don't seem to be envious of El
Duque's sudden stature as their No. 1 pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pitchers to a man,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankee
manager, ``realize he deserves this; he's earned this.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, who was Torre's most trustworthy post-season starter
in other years, appreciates El Duque's attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-season,'' Cone said, ``you need a certain presence
and confidence. It's not something you can see as much as you sense
it and feel it. He's got it.''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque, who was 17-9 during the season, has been the Yankees'
best pitcher for three months, with the emphasis on being a
``pitcher'' rather merely a thrower.
</P>
<P>
   But in two starts against the Braves in interleague play, El
Duque hasn't had it.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16 at Yankee Stadium, he was strafed for six runs,
including four homers, in only four and two-thirds innings in a
game the Yankees lost, 10-7, when Mariano Rivera gave up four runs,
including Andruw Jones' three-run homer. In a 7-2 defeat at Yankee
Stadium in 1998, he was the losing pitcher to left-hander Tom
Glavine, the Braves' starter Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is aware of El Duque's previous problems with the Braves'
batting order, but doesn't seem concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not hitting his spots and he's not changing speeds,
he's had trouble,'' Torre said. ``We just want him to have the
command and the count on his side. And he's not afraid of
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jorge Posada, who usually catches El Duque, those
problems with the Braves may be a blessing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be even more intense,'' Posada said. ``He'll want to
show what he can do because he hasn't done it.''
</P>
<P>
   El Duque hasn't done it against the Braves as yet, but in three
starts against the Texas Rangers and the Boston Red Sox so far in
this post-season, he has been virtually perfect: 23 innings, 14
hits allowed, 19 strikeouts, 12 bases on balls, 2-0 record, 1.17
earned run average, .171 opponents' batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game in Boston the other night, he was amazing,'' Posada
said of the 6-1 victory that clinched the American League pennant.
``Whatever I called, he put it where I wanted it. When he's right,
I can go to any pitch in any count and it will still be a good
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   With another start very likely in the fifth Series game, El
Duque may have a chance to equal the record for post-season
victories _ four _ shared by seven pitchers, including El Duque's
half-brother, Livan Hernandez, with the Florida Marlins in 1997.
The others:
</P>
<P>
   David Wells with last year's Yankees, John Smoltz with the '96
Braves, Orel Hershiser with the '95 Indians, Jack Morris with the
'91 Twins, Dave Stewart with the '89 Athletics and Burt Hooton with
the `81 Dodgers (when a midseason strike created divisional
playoffs between first-half and second-half winners).
</P>
<P>
   So the World Series provides quite an opportunity for a pitcher
who only two years ago had been banned from Cuban baseball because
Fidel Castro's authorities believed he was about to defect. Which
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so street smart,'' Posada said. ``If you go to eat with
him, he'll see somebody with a camera long before you do. He's
always looking. But other than talking about some Cuban players, he
doesn't talk about Cuba. He really has turned the page on that part
of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada, whose Cuban father moved to Puerto Rico about 30 years
ago, knows El Duque better than any other teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language barrier keeps guys from knowing him, but he's
learning English slowly,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things in America are still all new to him. It's like being
blind for 20 years and now you can see; if you're told somebody is
wearing a blue sweater, you'll say, `Why is that blue?' They
brainwash you in Cuba. You don't know the why of anything there.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Cuba the right-hander known as El Duque learned the why
of pitching. That's why he's starting for the Yankees in the World
Series opener.

CAMPBELL NEARS DECISION ON WHETHER TO SEEK SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: SUBS 9thgraf, Once conservatives, to correct attribution,
Rohrabacher sted Campbell; filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell, nearing a decision on whether to
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year, says he
doubts his vote to impeach President Clinton would hurt him in an
state-wide election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see it as a problem,'' says Campbell, 47, a
softspoken Stanford University law school professor who is expected
to announce as early as next week whether he will seek the
Republican nomination to run for Feinstein's seat. ``The matter has
evaporated, except for the occasional compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, defending his impeachment vote last year, says he has
a clear standard for whether a politician is worthy of holding
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an individual intentionally did not tell the truth'' to a
federal grand jury, that ``incapacitates'' that person from holding
political office, Campbell said in an interview in his Capitol Hill
office earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A 4th-term Republican House member known for breaking with his
party occasionally, Campbell says he applied the same standard to
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and refused to back him as
speaker after Gingrich admitted submitting inaccurate information
to the House Ethics Committee. Campbell later joined an attempt to
oust Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a staunch conservative who
shares a love of Irish pub music with Campbell and refers to the
two of them and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., as the ``Tres
Amigos,'' says Campbell's support for gun control and abortion
rights will ``keep many conservatives away.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he's convinced California voters want a Senate
candidate who votes conservatively on fiscal issue and moderately
on social issues _ and that's how he describes himself.
</P>
<P>
   While Campbell might not be the top choice for conservatives in
the primary, he would be in the general election, Rohrabacher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once conservatives understand the general thrust that Tom
Campbell has had in Washington, they will have no trouble
supporting him over Dianne Feinstein,'' Rohrabacher says.
</P>
<P>
   If Campbell runs, he would contend for the Republican nomination
with at least four conservatives _ Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron
Unz, State Senate Minority Whip Ray Haynes, San Diego County
Supervisor Bill Horn, and businessman J.P. Gough.
</P>
<P>
   Unz would likely present the strongest challenge to Campbell,
according to John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont
McKenna College.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney says Unz ``is one of the few people in the state of
California who is as smart as Tom Campbell. These are two of the
smartest guys in politics today. It would be good for the state to
see that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell would face a steep fund-raising challenge to raise the
estimated $5 million needed for the primary and $20 million needed
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The state-wide Field Poll, released Thursday, showed Feinstein
with a huge lead over Campbell and other potential Republican
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters in a hypothetical general election, Feinstein
won 55 percent of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Campbell had a tiny lead other possible
Republican nominees in matchups against Feinstein. Unz came in
second, winning 26 percent against Feinstein's 59 percent. Unz was
the prime mover behind the voter-approved Proposition 227 last
year, which put strict limits on bilingual education in state
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Field poll was conducted Oct. 8-17 among 514 likely voters,
with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders and Republican members of Congress confirm that
Campbell has discussed with them whether he should make the run.
However, Campbell dodges questions about his plans and refuses to
compare his record to Feinstein's, saying it is premature to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wise for me to make a decision and then go
forward _ as opposed to discussing it before the decision,'' he
said.

   JAPAN-MEMORIAL (Washington) _ In Japanese culture, cranes
represent happiness, good fortune and longevity. But in the
sculpture soon to rise here in the shadow of the Capitol, two
cranes will be shown fighting with their claws and wings to get
free of barbed wire and shackles. The sculpture will be at the
heart of a National Japanese American Memorial for which ground is
to be broken Friday. The memorial will offer a vivid reminder of a
painful moment in U.S. history, when during World War II Japanese
Americans were taken from their homes and sent to internment camps
because of their race.

   FILM-STRAIGHT (Undated) _ David Lynch is one of the few
successful American filmmakers who seems to have made little or no
concession to commercial considerations throughout his career.
Consistently, he makes whatever film interests him at the time.
This time, it is ``The Straight Story,'' a low-key, low-budget,
G-rated inspirational film for the Disney company about an old man
on a journey. I loved it, but it's exactly the kind of
underwhelming movie that seems guaranteed to get lost in the

quintessentially ``American'' movie that captures the elusive
essence of life in that loss-of-innocence time _ the 1960s. Adapted
from Mark Childress' 1994 novel about a boy's coming of age in the
turbulent, volatile Civil Rights-era South, the film is rife with
the sudden, harsh truths about the real world that emerges with
adolescence.

CAMPBELL NEARS DECISION ON WHETHER TO SEEK SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: SUBS 9thgraf, Once conservatives, to correct attribution,
Rohrabacher sted Campbell; filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell, nearing a decision on whether to
run against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year, says he
doubts his vote to impeach President Clinton would hurt him in an
state-wide election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see it as a problem,'' says Campbell, 47, a
softspoken Stanford University law school professor who is expected
to announce as early as next week whether he will seek the
Republican nomination to run for Feinstein's seat. ``The matter has
evaporated, except for the occasional compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, defending his impeachment vote last year, says he has
a clear standard for whether a politician is worthy of holding
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an individual intentionally did not tell the truth'' to a
federal grand jury, that ``incapacitates'' that person from holding
political office, Campbell said in an interview in his Capitol Hill
office earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A 4th-term Republican House member known for breaking with his
party occasionally, Campbell says he applied the same standard to
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and refused to back him as
speaker after Gingrich admitted submitting inaccurate information
to the House Ethics Committee. Campbell later joined an attempt to
oust Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a staunch conservative who
shares a love of Irish pub music with Campbell and refers to the
two of them and Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., as the ``Tres
Amigos,'' says Campbell's support for gun control and abortion
rights will ``keep many conservatives away.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he's convinced California voters want a Senate
candidate who votes conservatively on fiscal issue and moderately
on social issues _ and that's how he describes himself.
</P>
<P>
   While Campbell might not be the top choice for conservatives in
the primary, he would be in the general election, Rohrabacher says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once conservatives understand the general thrust that Tom
Campbell has had in Washington, they will have no trouble
supporting him over Dianne Feinstein,'' Rohrabacher says.
</P>
<P>
   If Campbell runs, he would contend for the Republican nomination
with at least four conservatives _ Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron
Unz, State Senate Minority Whip Ray Haynes, San Diego County
Supervisor Bill Horn, and businessman J.P. Gough.
</P>
<P>
   Unz would likely present the strongest challenge to Campbell,
according to John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont
McKenna College.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney says Unz ``is one of the few people in the state of
California who is as smart as Tom Campbell. These are two of the
smartest guys in politics today. It would be good for the state to
see that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell would face a steep fund-raising challenge to raise the
estimated $5 million needed for the primary and $20 million needed
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The state-wide Field Poll, released Thursday, showed Feinstein
with a huge lead over Campbell and other potential Republican
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Among all voters in a hypothetical general election, Feinstein
won 55 percent of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Campbell had a tiny lead other possible
Republican nominees in matchups against Feinstein. Unz came in
second, winning 26 percent against Feinstein's 59 percent. Unz was
the prime mover behind the voter-approved Proposition 227 last
year, which put strict limits on bilingual education in state
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Field poll was conducted Oct. 8-17 among 514 likely voters,
with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders and Republican members of Congress confirm that
Campbell has discussed with them whether he should make the run.
However, Campbell dodges questions about his plans and refuses to
compare his record to Feinstein's, saying it is premature to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wise for me to make a decision and then go
forward _ as opposed to discussing it before the decision,'' he
said.

INTELLECTUALS URGE TURKEY TO END WAR ON ITS KURDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ Turkey's most prominent cultural figure, novelist
Yasar Kemal, has urged the government to ``save Turkey from her
shame'' by granting more rights to Kurds and ending the war that
has been under way in the mostly Kurdish southeast for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   With four other writers seated beside him at a recent news
conference, Kemal, who is of Kurdish descent, called the Kurdish
issue Turkey's ``most critical problem.'' He said the government's
refusal to grant cultural rights to Kurds was a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for greater rights for Turkey's Kurds, estimated to
number 10 million to 15 million, and for an end to the use of force
in the southeast, Kemal was violating taboos of Turkish politics.
He and his four supporters could face prosecution for advocating
Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   But periodically over the last 15 years Turkish intellectuals
have spoken out against their government's policy toward Kurds.
With fighting in the Kurdish region now decreasing and the
principal insurgent leader in jail, Kemal and his four supporters
decided that the time was right for another appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Kemal urged that the Kurds ``be given their rights and dignity
so that they can once again become a dynamic entity in Anatolia and
Turkey.'' The Turkish government vigorously denies the
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will swear at us, but let them know that the truth cannot
be destroyed with curses,'' Kemal, 77, said of Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
   Others who signed a statement urging more rights for the Kurds
seemed equally unconcerned with the prospect of prosecution.
``Frankly, we don't care,'' said one of them, Ahmet Altan, an
essayist and social critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to wage war against the Kurds, we lost our war for
civilization,'' Altan said. ``Unfortunately we are not part of the
civilized world now. But we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The writers' statement was endorsed by 46 cultural figures from
other countries, among them Guenter Grass, Nadine Gordimer, Ingmar
Bergman, Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter and Elie Wiesel. But it was
the presence of Kemal, who towers over modern Turkish literature,
that gave the statement resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Kemal's novels are written in a simple, direct style that has
made him immensely popular. Often they tell stories of oppression
so cruel that it drives victims to rebellion. His best-known work,
``Mehmet, My Hawk,'' may be the most widely read of all Turkish
novels.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's political class maintains a paradoxical relationship
with Kemal. When he wins international recognition, government
officials congratulate him, bask in his reflected glory, and mutter
that his failure to win the Nobel Prize can only be a result of
anti-Turkish prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, prosecutors have shown themselves quite ready to
file charges against him for his pro-Kurdish statements, although
his celebrity is evidently sufficient to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be growing support in Turkey for a review of
policies toward Kurdish nationalism, but the government has given
no sign that it is considering any change of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of human rights issues in Turkey is especially
sensitive now because the European Union may soon decide whether to
accept Turkey as a candidate for membership. Leaders of several
European countries have said Turkey cannot qualify as long it does
not end the Kurdish conflict and the human rights violations that
have accompanied it.

 &HT;    Release of Bush biography held as author's credibility
questioned
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A new biography alleging that Gov. George W.
Bush was once arrested for cocaine possession was yanked Thursday
because of the publisher's concerns about the author's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The book's author, J.H. Hatfield, served time in a Texas prison
for hiring a hit man to make a failed attempt to kill a former
boss, according to a published report. The author also may have
puffed up his writing credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Mr. Hatfield's credibility has been called into serious
question, we feel compelled to suspend publication,'' said Sally
Richardson, president and publisher of St. Martin's Press trade
division.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the publisher's announcement, the book was still
available Thursday afternoon at several Austin bookstores. All said
they had heard no word of the decision to suspend sales.
</P>
<P>
   The book, entitled ``Fortunate Son,'' details conversations
Hatfield had with anonymous sources. Those sources confirmed that
Bush had been arrested in 1972 for cocaine possession, he says. The
book says the case was dropped and the records expunged after Bush,
with intervention from his father, was allowed to perform community
service in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the elder Bush was a former congressman serving as
the United States ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-president Bush and Gov. Bush vehemently denied the cocaine
allegation. Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said the
publisher's move was ``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hatfield, an Arkansas resident, could not be
reached for comment. On Wednesday, he told The Dallas Morning News
that he is not the J.H. Hatfield imprisoned in Texas for hiring a
hit man to kill a former boss in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Criminal Justice records show that James
Howard Hatfield entered a guilty plea in 1988 to a charge of
solicitation of capital murder. Hatfield was sentenced to 15 years
in prison. He served five years and was released to federal
officials in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Justice Department spokesman Stennett Posey said
Hatfield then served approximately one year in an Oklahoma federal
prison before being released to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Hatfield alleged he hired a hit man in 1987 to
use a car bomb to kill a former employer. A bomb exploded in a
downtown parking lot, but nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Cobb of Bentonville, Ark., Hatfield's parole officer,
declined comment Thursday. Earlier, Cobb told the Dallas paper that
the Hatfield under his supervision was the author of a biography of
actor Patrick Stewart. The Bush book identifies Hatfield as the
author of a book about Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   A news release touting the Bush book listed Hatfield as a
``syndicated columnist, free-lance Texas journalist and frequent
contributor to several Lone Star state newspapers and magazines,
including the Dallas Times-Herald, Houston Post, Dallas Observer
and The Texas Women's News.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Lyons, Dallas Observer editor, said Thursday there was no
record of Hatfield ever writing for the weekly publication.
</P>
<P>
   A computer search of the now-defunct Houston Post's archives
showed no record of a J.H. Hatfield writing anything in the paper
from 1985 until it folded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Bode, who worked at the Dallas Times-Herald from 1977
through 1991 and was its editor when the paper closed, said he had
no memory of Hatfield.

DIGNITARIES PAY TRIBUTE TO NYERERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ Inside a stadium thronged by thousands
of mourners standing and sitting under a merciless sun on Thursday,
leaders from all corners of Africa and officials from the West paid
tribute to Julius Nyerere, the founding father of Tanzania and one
of the most influential independence leaders on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   A line of dignitaries, including Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, walked along a red carpet that led into a glass mausoleum
where Nyerere's body lay in an open coffin. A phalanx of military
officers later draped the coffin in a flag of Tanzania, the East
African nation that was born after Nyerere guided the British Trust
Territory of Tanganyika into sovereignty in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Many African rulers influenced by Nyerere attended the funeral,
including Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Joaquim
Chissano of Mozambique, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda. Princess Anne represented Britain, and Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari attended as the head of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of this seaside capital were quiet as the government
declared a national holiday to mourn the former president, who died
last Thursday in a London hospital at the age of 77. Nyerere, who
had been receiving treatment for leukemia, suffered a major stroke
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   His body was flown here to lie in state early this week.
Millions of Tanzanians had filed through the stadium to pay respect
to the man who ruled them from 1962 to 1985, and whom they called
Mwalimu, or teacher in Swahili.
</P>
<P>
   His support of liberation movements and his role as an elder
statesman in Africa, but especially the moral rectitude for which
he was equally famous, drew the praise of African leaders _ even of
those from nations that do not share his socialist philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no question that Julius Nyerere was every inch a
builder and one of the great leaders of our time,'' said Albright,
who is winding down a weeklong visit through Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Praise also came from ordinary Tanzanians who filled the
35,000-seat national stadium and who, for a state funeral,
circulated with ease and casualness. Nyerere was remembered for
building a nation out of a land with more than 120 ethnic groups,
an enormous feat on a continent riven with ethnic conflicts that
are often exploited by politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost an important man in Africa,'' said Salem Mkiba, a
55-year-old civil servant, who was standing at the rear of the
stadium where the dignitaries' speeches were barely audible. ``He
was the real builder of this nation. Without him, I don't know
where we would be. Look at our country. Tanzania is one of the only
peaceful and unified countries in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Nyerere's funeral drew many African leaders, they also
suggested how they have yet to meet Nyerere's ideal of a united
Africa. Almost no president came from French-speaking African
countries, as the divide with English-speaking African remains a
legacy of colonialism. Also, among the leaders present _ including
the leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Uganda _ many are
currently at war with each other or another African nation.

<P>
   The long, brutal process that leads to Alzheimer's disease
starts when a single enzyme snips a protein that protrudes from
brain cells, leading to the release of toxic shards. Now scientists
report that they have found that enzyme, opening the door to
developing drugs that might block it and _ if the drugs prove safe
_ prevent or slow the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the enzyme had eluded teams of scientists at
universities and drug companies for more than a decade, though they
had given it a name, beta-secretase. So many false claims of
victory were announced that investigators automatically doubted
anyone who claimed to have found it.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that the new work, by Dr. Martin Citron and his
colleagues at Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks,
Calif., is different _ that it passes crucial tests of
authenticity, convincing even some skeptics. The report appears in
Friday's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sangram Sisodia, chairman of the department of neurobiology,
pharmacology and physiology at the University of Chicago, said that
when he first heard of the Amgen result, he dismissed it, saying,
``It's junk. It has been junk after junk for 12 years.'' But he
added, ``When I read the paper, I was overwhelmed. The set of
experiments in this paper was a tour de force.''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm was shared by other scientists, also not
connected with the study. ``We now have a target, an identified
target for drug development,'' said Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, a professor
of neurology at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, Citron said, is that such a drug might stop the
progress of Alzheimer's disease in a person who has it, or even
prevent it in those likely to develop it. Still, Citron and other
scientists emphasized that the development of a drug was still
years away and that its success could not be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With the beta-secretase discovery, several scientists said, the
field of Alzheimer's research is poised at the same place as AIDS
research several years ago, when scientists discovered that the
AIDS virus needed a protease _ an enzyme that cuts protein _ to
replicate.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies seized on that discovery, searching for compounds
to block the HIV protease. Now protease inhibitors are on the
market and are a vital part of AIDS therapy. Beta-secretase is also
a protease, and its method of cutting is similar to the method of
the HIV protease.
</P>
<P>
   ``With beta-secretase, the field of Alzheimer's research has now
been granted the same opportunity that AIDS researchers were
granted,'' Tanzi said. ``This is as exciting for Alzheimer's
research as the HIV protease enzyme was for AIDS research.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman Relkin, an Alzheimer's specialist at the
Weill-Cornell Medical Center in New York, said there was no doubt
about the potential unleashed by the discovery. ``This is one of
the long-sought-after holy grails of Alzheimer's research,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Alzheimer's disease, brain cells die, slowly and inexorably,
as patients gradually lose their memories, their judgment, their
ability to balance a checkbook or find their way around their
neighborhoods or even their own homes. And as patients' minds
crumble, areas of their brains that control memory and reasoning
and judgment are covered with an accumulation of microscopic balls
of debris, known as amyloid, mostly made up of aggregations of a
protein fragment called A beta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us, and most of the big pharmaceutical companies,
agree that if you figure out a way of getting rid of amyloid, you
will have a good drug for Alzheimer's disease,'' Tanzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, scientists have learned that A beta is a small
piece of a much larger protein that protrudes from cells. It can be
created when the beta-secretase clips the protein in two and then
another enzyme, gamma-secretase, snips the resulting protein
fragments, creating one piece that is the toxic A beta protein and
another that is a harmless piece of protein debris.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, scientists could stop A beta production by blocking
either the beta- or the gamma-secretase. But both enzymes were
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there are multiple proteases, and in
making cell extracts, you release all of the proteases,'' Citron
said. ``It is very hard to sort out which are relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Several large drug companies decided to go ahead anyway, even
without the beta-secretase or the gamma-secretase in hand. Instead,
they studied cells in the laboratory that released A beta protein
and looked for drugs that would prevent the substance from being
released.
</P>
<P>
   Citron and his colleagues decided to take a different tack _ to
look for the gene that directs cells to make beta-secretase. In a
long and tedious set of experiments that began in 1997, they began
a process of progressive elimination, searching first for a string
of about 100 genes that contained the one they wanted, then
narrowing the gene strings down to batches of 20 and, finally,
homing in on the gene. With the gene in hand, they could use it to
make the enzyme and show that the enzyme cut the large precursor
protein at exactly the right spot and at no other spot.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen is now looking for compounds that can block the beta
secretase. Citron cautioned that it would be several years before a
potential drug is found and tested sufficiently in the laboratory
and in animals that the company is ready to initiate tests with
people.
</P>
<P>
   Relkin, of the Weill-Cornell center, said it was impossible to
predict how soon such a drug could be developed. But he added, ``It
is certainly exciting to be able to ask these questions.''

BRADLEY, IN N.Y., OFFERS PLAN TO CURB CHILD POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Presidential candidate Bill Bradley came to one of
Brooklyn's poorest neighborhoods Thursday to call for an end to
``child poverty as we know it'' by the end of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before teachers, social workers, and political
activists in a crowded Baptist church in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
section, the former Democratic senator compared the task to
Franklin D. Roosevelt's vow to end the Depression and John F.
Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Bradley said, the president ``wasn't sure exactly
how to do it, but he knew that we had to do it, and the first step
was saying so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went well beyond that first step Thursday, laying out
details of a plan, which he said would cost $9.8 billion a year and
would reduce by 7 million, or roughly by half, the number of
impoverished children. The plan would:
</P>
<P>
   --Increase the minimum wage by $1 over the next two years, then
index it to annual rises in the national median wage.
</P>
<P>
   --Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   --Subsidize child care for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   --Enroll 400,000 more children in Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   --Give scholarships, or forgive loan repayments, to 60,000
college students who go to work as teachers in low-income urban and
rural public schools.
</P>
<P>
   --Offer tax incentives to nonprofit groups that create
after-school community centers for poor schoolchildren and ``second
chance homes'' that would provide adult help to poor, pregnant
teenagers during their babies' first year.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Vice President Al Gore's campaign dismissed
Bradley's attempt to present himself as the preeminent candidate
for America's poor. One aide, Roger Salazar, called Bradley's plan
``more an echo than a voice,'' saying Gore had already proposed _
or, in some cases, helped enact _ many of his challenger's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his speech, Bradley made light of the
Clinton-Gore administration's efforts to deal with the problem,
saying child poverty has been cut by only 3.8 percent in the past
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office disputed this figure, saying it has actually been
cut by 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Palmer, spokesman for Columbia University's National
Center for Children in Poverty, attempted to clear up the conflict.
From 1993 until 1998, he said, the percentage of children in
poverty has gone down, from 22.7 percent to 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you measure this,'' Palmer said, ``depends on whether you
look at percentages or percentage points.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, they're both correct,'' Palmer said. ``To us, the
important thing is that Bradley has committed himself to cutting
the rate by half within a decade. That would bring the rate of
children in poverty down to 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope,'' he continued, ``that, rather than get into a
debate over numbers, all the candidates _ Bradley and Gore, (Texas
Governor George) Bush and (Arizona Senator John) McCain _ would
agree on that as a goal, then have a debate over how you get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in a move widely seen as a preemption of Bradley's
address, Gore made a speech of his own on the subject, proposing to
give federal child-support funds only to states that imprison
deadbeat dads; to deny Workfare to parents who don't make
child-care payments; and to turn over their names to credit-card
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palmer gave Bradley points for being the first candidate
to declare poverty-cutting as a high-profile goal _ and to state a
precise target.
</P>
<P>
   According to official figures, 13.5 million children under the
age of 18 live in poverty, defined as a family of four earning less
than $16,400 a year.

HICKS MIGHT NOT TRIM RANGERS' BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two weeks ago, Rangers' owner Tom Hicks said
substantial budget cuts would be necessary, prompting the local
media to predict a massive clubhouse purge, starting with two-time
American League MVP Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday, however, the late Gilda Radner was needed in
Arlington to deliver her signature line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his contractual status, Gonzalez remains a prime
candidate to be traded in the off-season, but what might remain the
same in 2000 is this year's $75 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can improve next season's team for the same $75 million,
then, yes, I'm willing,'' Hicks said. ``If we can improve for
something less, I'd be even more pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by airphone from his private jet, Hicks said he heard
``three hours worth of ideas'' from general manager Doug Melvin
this week. ``I like Doug's plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks confirmed that Melvin presented him with a 2000 players
payroll budget of less than $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number gave us parameters to work with,'' Hicks said,
``but because of all the uncertainties in the baseball market, I
think it's necessary to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying within the budget is a goal, but depending on what
happens, we can go higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hicks nor Melvin would reveal the 2000 budget number,
but it doesn't necessarily matter. Not if Hicks is again pledged to
be a ``player'' in the high stakes poker game of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ownership has given me flexibility if the right things come
up,'' Melvin said. ``While attempting to build a strong farm
system, maybe I spent more money \Ron the major-league payroll\S
than I should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with this commitment from Mr. Hicks, we can do what we
hope is right for both long-term and short-term _ establish a core
of solid frontline players and then attempt to build around it with
youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Hicks said the '99 financial losses for the
Rangers would be $15 million to $17 million. Also at that time, he
was attempting to deal with his team having been a postseason
offensive embarrassment in consecutive Octobers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't changed my thinking all that much \Rfrom two
weeks ago\S,'' Hicks said yesterday. ``The disappointment is still
there, and based on everything, I'd like the payroll to be lower.
But I also want to win, and the fans are our partners in this, and
we have to always try and do what's right for them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question there has been fandom backlash for the
Rangers once the budget-slashing stuff hit print. The Rangers had
raised ticket prices three consecutive seasons, starting in '97,
although the Hicks' regime was responsible for only the 1999 hike.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance of 2.75 million was also a serious disappointment
this season, and Hicks has vowed an all-out push this winter to
build a very low season-ticket base.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible for his team to slash its budget, move out
some key players and also improve attendance in 2000 by selling
more season tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Common sense says nada. But in Arlington, baseball is a
different animal.
</P>
<P>
   The fans are restless while waiting on postseason progress. But
during the long wait, it's a club that can draw 2.7 million to 2.9
million just by opening the doors for 81 games. Reaching higher to,
say, a profitable 3.3 million level, will happen if the Rangers
ever become a postseason factor.
</P>
<P>
   Give Hicks credit for this backing off a substantial bankroll
cut in 2000. With a payroll of around $55 million, he could have
been at a break-even financial point with a 2.8 million gate draw.
Instead, the dice might be rolled again.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Rangers are several weeks away from setting ticket
prices for the 2000 season. Nothing is final, but tickets might be
reduced in well over half of The Ballpark in Arlington's 49,000
seats, with a small price raise confined to less than 5 percent of
the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``An announcement will be coming around the first of November,''
Hicks said. ``I can promise we will be aggressive in selling
tickets and very fair in dealing with the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Yankees-induced playoff agony still an unpleasant
memory, Hicks took an unexpected reverse step yesterday in the
direction of fan fairness. If another $75 million is needed, he's
willing to spend in a business gone crazy with spending.

SHORTAGE OF CHIPS FROM QUAKE'S DEVASTATION ON TAIWAN IS BRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The personal computer industry has a variety of
things to worry about these days, but it turns out that supply
problems from the deadly earthquake in Taiwan last month may not be
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to foresight, providence and factory workers who toiled
around the clock through a traditional Chinese festival, the
disaster a month ago that killed more than 2,000 people seems not
to have caused the widespread shortage of semiconductors many
experts feared.
</P>
<P>
   And though several American high-technology producers have
warned that such shortages could crimp earnings and make it hard to
meet the coming holiday-season demands for personal computers, some
of the biggest suppliers to those companies say not only that they
are back to normal, but also that they have managed to fill most of
their September orders.
</P>
<P>
   Chips are the brains of computers, and warnings from computer
makers about the impact of the Taiwan quake may just reflect the
industry tendency of making cautionary predictions. But the stark
divergence between the appraisals from corporations in the United
States and the optimism close to the quake's center is leading some
analysts and executives to wonder whether the companies are perhaps
blaming Mother Nature for other, man-made problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a company doesn't make its numbers, they try to come
up with a reason,'' said Dane Anderson, a manager at International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan companies are important subcontractors for
high-technology consumer products and components. They produce
electronics that go into some of the world's best-known brands,
including IBM, Motorola and Toshiba, and Taiwan is the world's
third-largest source of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   This month, at least four U.S. companies warned of potential
problems caused by the quake. The chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard told analysts that the company was sure to suffer
disruptions and delays. Advanced Micro Devices said problems in
Taiwan had hampered production of its new Athlon microprocessor and
could slow sales this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, though saying it expected no ``material impact,'' warned
retailers that it would be unable to fill all their orders this
month. And on Monday, Dell said a spike in prices for memory chips
would hurt earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for personal computers, particularly portables, has been
strong all year and the last three months of the year tend to be
the strongest. But fierce competition to offer buyers an array of
the latest features at lower prices has eroded profit margins and
forced manufacturers to keep less stock on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Taiwan quake, analysts said, personal computer
makers faced short supplies of hard-disk drives and of flat-panel
screens for laptops. The booming market for mobile phones,
moreover, has led some semiconductor makers to divert capacity from
making chips for personal computers to making more profitable chips
for phones.
</P>
<P>
   Though Taiwan's semiconductor companies largely avoided
structural damage, production was halted by a weeklong power
cutoff. And despite soaring prices for memory chips, Taiwan
represents relatively little threat to global supplies: it accounts
for about 12 percent of the world's production.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the greatest risk was a shortage of more complex
logic chips used to run computer graphics and sound, as well as to
control hard-disk drives. Companies would need weeks, they had
predicted, to recalibrate sensitive equipment and run tests to make
sure that their intricate chips functioned properly.
</P>
<P>
   Some delays remain inevitable. An executive at Acer Laboratories
in the United States said this week that the Taiwan-based Acer had
delayed shipments of chip sets, which link logic chips to the rest
of the computer, and that computer makers would probably fall short
of their production targets as a result.
</P>
<P>
   When the quake hit, it shut down the island's largest chip
producer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend was the Midautumn Festival, an event celebrated
across Asia. At Taiwan Semiconductor, employees who would normally
be home nibbling moon cakes worked through the night to put the
company's factories back in order, said Ron Norris, the senior vice
president for worldwide sales and marketing. Power was restored by
Saturday and by the following Tuesday, the company was back up to
90 percent of production. Roughly 23,000 silicon wafers, each
containing as many as 1,000 chips, had to be scrapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company was fortunate: rather than store its wafers
in big open containers, it had begun keeping them in sealed ones,
Norris said, which reduced damage and contamination. Even so, he
said, ``There's about two weeks of production that are just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of supply should have affected Asustek Computer, a
leading manufacturer of motherboards, the circuit boards that hold
many of the chips in a computer. Asustek plugs the chips into
motherboards before they are installed, and it had only three or
four weeks of chips on hand when the quake struck. David Chan, a
company spokesman, said Asustek's employees worked through the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   With power off during the day, employees fired up a generator
and turned off the lights and air-conditioners. Power came on at
night, so they set up a graveyard shift, he said. The result: the
company missed less than 1 percent of its September orders,
according to Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite damage in excess of $2 billion from the quake, soaring
demand for electronics enabled Taiwan to post a nearly 1 percent
increase in exports in September.
</P>
<P>
   Norris speculated that given the amount of inventory typically
built up between a chip's manufacture and the time it ends up in a
personal computer, Taiwan's electronics companies should be able to
meet this quarter's demand for PCs with few disruptions. ``That's
why I'm concerned about anybody placing any dramatic impact on
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the quake has underscored the risks of
manufacturing on an island that straddles an earthquake fault line.
Taiwan's electronics companies are already taking steps to protect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Winbond Electronics, another chip maker, said this week that it
was reconsidering building a new factory in the same industrial
park as its five other plants and that it was looking overseas.
Asustek said it would seek permission to build two plants in China.

she set off a metal detector at Heathrow Airport, told the
Telegraph of London that the incident had a profound impact on her.

<P>
   ``What happened at the airport brought the fear of death to
me,'' she said. ``After Heathrow, I am scared of dying. I really
am. It opened up a lot of fears for me. ... When I got back to
Connecticut, I had to get a minister to pray for me over the

``60-ish man with brown teeth'' inviting a teenager to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``As anti-smoking spots go, this one is more resonant than most.
That's because it isn't about death, it's about ugliness. Mortality
data are nothing to teenagers, who think they're invulnerable. But
brown teeth ... that's a horror they understand, believe and
internalize in an instant. ... Many children will see this and be
put off from smoking, by a company that sells cigarettes. Which is
undeniably positive, and positively absurd.''

 &HT;    End of child poverty is Bradley's latest goal
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Invoking former Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and
John F. Kennedy, Bill Bradley on Thursday proposed spending $10
billion a year to ``end child poverty as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also proposed increasing the minimum wage $1 over two
years and tying future increases to the nation's median wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, at a time of unparalleled prosperity, I look out over a
nation and I see that nearly one-fifth of our children are ill-fed,
ill-housed and ill-educated,'' Bradley told a mostly
African-American audience in Brooklyn, as he echoed the famous
words Roosevelt first said during the Depression. ``I am issuing a
simple challenge today. Let us eliminate child poverty as we know
it in America by the end of the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech on poverty came a day after Vice President Al
Gore, at a Washington, D.C., church, offered more modest proposals
on fathers who don't pay child support. It was the third time Gore
had spoken about a specific issue shortly before Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley didn't mention his rival for the Democratic nomination.
But afterward, aides accused Gore of waging a ``campaign of
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley talks about children and poverty every day,''
said Bradley aide Anita Dunn. ``He's never seen it as a tactical
maneuver to blunt an opponent. You just have to look at what Al
Gore is talking about and when it gets scheduled. Maybe if they had
more of their own ideas they wouldn't have to continually pre-empt
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, Gore's spokeswoman, said the Bradley campaign had it
backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as though (former) Senator Bradley's big ideas are
actually Al Gore's ideas,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech was the last outlining Bradley's domestic
agenda. Earlier, he proposed a $55 billion program to offer health
care insurance to those who can't afford it through the private
network of insurers that cover federal employees. He has also
proposed spending $2 billion on child care.
</P>
<P>
   All of the initiatives have been intended to cast Bradley, a
former New Jersey senator and Rhodes scholar, as a big thinker.
</P>
<P>
   They also make Bradley the freest spender of all the
presidential candidates. Altogether, Bradley has proposed more than
$70 billion in new domestic programs, funded out of the $1 trillion
in non-Social Security surpluses estimated over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He has not said how he would pay for the programs if those
projections are reduced by an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to speculate about different variables,''
said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley gave only passing mention to the fact that child poverty
has declined from 26 percent to 22 percent since 1994 while
President Clinton and Gore have served.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley characterized his proposals on child poverty as only a
``down payment,'' and he likened his goal of ending such poverty to
Kennedy's vow to put a man on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliminating child poverty as we know it is a big goal,'' he
continued. ``But the first step is the commitment and I am making
that here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley won enthusiastic reviews from the hundreds who crowded
into the gym at Concord Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right on target with the issues that may not be on the
agenda of most politicians,'' said Concord pastor Gary Simpson.
``He raises the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his proposals could put 3 million of the nation's
13.5 million poor children above the poverty line by 2004, and help
another 4 million by 2008. The poverty line is defined by the
government as a yearly income of $16,400 or less for a family of
four.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond raising the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour, Bradley
proposed a $4 billion expansion of the earned income tax credit, a
cash rebate claimed by about 10 million tax filers who earn less
than the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   A family of three with one parent working full-time and another
working part-time would get $2,920 a year more, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposed doubling the size of Head Start for
disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds to $8.7 billion over four years,
making it available to all eligible children.
</P>
<P>
   To lure teachers to underserved areas, Bradley proposed spending
$1.3 billion to pay the college loans of 50,000 teachers if they
agreed to work in poorer communities. He proposed scholarships for
10,000 high school students who agreed to seek teaching degrees and
work in poor areas for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Bradley proposed spending $1 billion a year to fund
nonprofits that established after-school programs, serving up to
5.6 million children in 2,000 centers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Edelman, an expert on child poverty who resigned from the
Clinton administration over passage of the 1996 welfare reform
bill, said the scope of Bradley's initiatives surpass anything Gore
is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very coherent package,'' Edelman said. ``The vice
president is unfortunately in the same tradition of the Clinton
administration. The rhetoric sounds OK, but the proposals are
miniscule.''

   NEW YORK _ The overture is only a warning.
</P>
<P>
   It starts before even a glimpse of scenery, including that
replica of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge with toy cars scuttling
across it, is on view and before there is any evidence of human
life. Yet somehow the entire experience of ``Saturday Night Fever:
The Musical,'' the dreary new stage adaptation of the 1977 movie,
is summed up in those moments before the curtain goes up on the
behemoth of a stage at the Minskoff Theater.
</P>
<P>
   There sits the audience, waiting for that shot of comfort that
comes from hearing old Top 40 hits associated with salad days of
freedom and recklessness, while a drop curtain glows with neon
reds, oranges and yellows. A gargantuan silhouette adorns the
curtain. It shows the evening's hero, the disco dance king Tony
Manero, striking the cocked-hip, raised-arm pose that John Travolta
made famous in the posters and album covers for the original movie.
</P>
<P>
   Then the orchestra starts up, and there are fitful eruptions of
applause in acknowledgment of era-defining songs by the Bee Gees
like ``Stayin' Alive'' and ``More Than a Woman.'' Yet the music
sounds distant and tinny, as if it were being played on some
souped-up eight-track tape system. Against the odds, there is
nothing at all infectious about it; your tappable feet and
snappable fingers stay alarmingly still. And there arises an
ominous feeling that any nostalgia on offer here is not of the wet,
warm, embracing kind but more of the freeze-dried variety.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but the two and a half hours that follow don't feel a
whole lot more animated and that outsized drawing on the drop
curtain may be the only commanding figure to show up on the stage.
Even in dance, and there is a lot of it, the show seems about as
lively as a diorama display. Despite its title, it has the body
temperature of a wax effigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Fever,'' which opened Thursday night, achieves
the distinction of turning the two dimensions provided by celluloid
into one dimension onstage. The evening, which chronicles the
19-year-old Tony's coming of age in the disco-mad Brooklyn of the
late 1970s, passes by as a joyless succession of flat words, sounds
and images that at best trigger memories of the vitality of the
film that inspired it. For the record, you can rent the original
movie, which still seems more hot than quaint, for about a
twentieth of the ticket price to the Broadway version.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've never followed the logic of the theater
marketing theory that if you loved the movie, you'll love the play.
The two forms are so different in the ways they manipulate
audiences that it seems folly to try to replicate, on a
scene-by-scene basis, a cinematic experience, unless you're aiming
for post-modern parody.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it appears that you can't go broke overestimating
the American public's appetite for reruns, even in ersatz form.
Witness the unlikely success of ``Footloose,'' another adaptation
of a dance film with a chart-climbing pop score, so clunky in its
transformation that it makes this ``Fever,'' which at least has a
plot you can follow, seem like ``My Fair Lady.'' ``Fever'' itself,
already a long-running success in London, racked up advance New
York sales of $14 million before it even went into previews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to imagine any theatergoer finding much
enjoyment in this hapless, robotic show. As directed and
choreographed by Arlene Phillips, with a book by Nan Knighton that
directly borrows the flavorful dialogue (minus the harsher
obscenities) from Norman Wexler's original screenplay, ``Saturday
Night Fever'' fails largely because it is lazy.
</P>
<P>
   The production's creative team has chosen mostly to imitate,
rather than reconceive, the form of the movie. The most salient
difference is that the songs by the Bee Gees and other artists,
used as background and dance music in the film, are now sung by
members of the cast (all sprouting those unfortunate head mikes),
led by James Carpinello as Tony. The effect brings to mind a
karaoke bar frequented by college students who could still use a
few more beers to loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   The musical struggles to cram in as much detail from the plot of
the movie as possible, and, boy, is it a tight fit. Gang warfare,
loss of religious faith, loss of virginity, a leap to death from
the Verrazano: all of these plot elements, while experienced by
other characters, serve to feed Tony's evolving disenchantment with
his Italian neighborhood in Bay Ridge, where ambitions are small
and futures claustrophobically fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the film the plot feels overpacked and strained, but the
fluidity of the camera work and the energy of the cross-cutting,
along with the automatic evocativeness of location photography, did
a lot to disguise this. Onstage, the same story unfolds as a
mechanical chain of episodes, with so much going on at any given
moment that you're not sure where to look. What's worse, the
essential, sustained focus on Tony himself dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is partly a question of casting. Granted, Carpinello
doesn't have the benefit of those long, loving close-ups that did
so much to establish Tony's character (and Travolta's stardom). The
greater problem, though, is that Carpinello, making his Broadway
debut, lacks the effortless charisma that demands attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Travolta managed to convey both brooding
adolescent uncertainty and a testosterone-charged confidence that
flourished most fully when he hit the dance floor of the club 2001
Odysssey. There he was, in the words of onlookers, ``a king.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not an epithet that sticks to the self-conscious
Carpinello. He works hard in his dance sequences, but the effort
reads in his face, and you sometimes sense him counting off the
steps in his head. You may find your eyes straying to see how
Tony's pals are managing with the same routines in the background
and at least one of them, Sean Palmer as Joey, blows the star off
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Carpinello, who has a mild, forgettable singing voice, has also
been encouraged to do exaggerated variations on Travolta's line
readings, resulting more in cartoon than character. In this sense,
he's not alone. It's telling that the most buffoonish role, that of
a lecherous disk jockey (Bryan Batt), is also the most vibrant.
Unlike his narcotized-seeming fellow performers, Batt gives the
appearance of relishing the vulgarity in his role, and he develops
a genuine rapport with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   As the two women in Tony's life, Paige Price and Orfeh offer
sketchbook portraits whose credibility isn't helped by their
generic pop ballads as big emotional solos. Paul Castree, as the
most vulnerable of Tony's friends, is assigned the same chore. Ms.
Phillips seems to have little idea about staging these numbers
beyond letting the actors walk around while waving their arms.
</P>
<P>
   As for the all-important dance sequences, they are mostly devoid
of sensuality, despite a lot of hip grinding and pelvic thrusts. It
is hard to make disco dancing seem fresh now, with both its songs
and steps having been so quickly appropriated by exercise teachers.
The routines here only rarely seem like more than than an advanced
Jane Fonda workout session.
</P>
<P>
   This considerably reduces the pleasures afforded by the show.
While Robin Wagner's evocation of the disco feels a tad gimcrack he
has done a dandy job with the big model of the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge. (Trend spotters: a bridge figures prominently in
``Footloose,'' too.) If you enjoy watching the train sets at FAO
Schwarz, you will probably enjoy watching the miniature cars on
Wagner's bridge. This represents only a fraction of the evening,
however.
</P>
<P>
   It actually might have been possible to make a seductive stage
musical out of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' in which the discotheque
would function as the cabaret does in ``Cabaret,'' a prism through
which a whole culture is reflected. Ms. Phillips and Ms. Knighton
have instead taken the path of least resistance, bluntly following
their cinematic prototype as though with tracing paper and Magic
Marker. How could the results be other than flat and flimsy?
</P>

MORE THAN 100 DIE AS RUSSIAN ROCKETS HIT CHECHEN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Rockets slammed into a crowded street market and other
parts of central Grozny on Thursday, killing more than 100 people
in the worst day of violence in Moscow's military campaign to
reassert control over breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen military officials said the rockets were fired by
Russian forces advancing on the capital, which have been pounding
Chechnya with airstrikes and artillery for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Defense Ministry, as it has consistently done whenever
civilians have been killed in Chechnya, denied responsibility for
the attack. Moscow says its strikes are aimed at bases used by
Islamic militants, but the rocket attack made it clear that no
place in the separatist Caucasus region was safe for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Grozny described a scene of carnage and destruction
after as many as six rockets exploded in the market, which was full
of shoppers during the early evening attack. Bodies and body parts
lay among the wrecked and bloodied stalls. Hundreds of terrified
people, some of them screaming and crying, ran through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   At least four other rockets exploded in other parts of the city,
including one that hit a maternity hospital, according to Magomed
Magomadov, a senior official in Chechnya's separatist government.
Magomadov put the death toll at 118 and estimated between 300 and
400 wounded. Many of the wounded faced operations in hospitals
already crowded from the fighting, short of medicine and, like the
rest of Chechnya. without electricity. ``We were at the central
city hospital,'' said Reuters correspondent Maria Eismont, a
veteran Russian war reporter who was 50 yards away when she said
one of the rockets hit the central market. ``It was packed with
corpses. There were women. Children. At least 30. There are so many
corpses and injured. Every minute they are bringing more and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack came as heavy clashes erupted between Russian troops
and separatist militants north of the capital, and the Russian
government issued a statement vowing to ``act decisively and
harshly to achieve the full restoation of law and order on the
whole territory of the Chechen republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials appeared to have little doubt the rockets were
an expression of this harshness. Mumaidi Saidayev, chief of staff
of Chechnya's military, said the rockets were Russian
surface-to-surface missiles fired by forces who have advanced to
high ground outside Grozny that overlooks the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came as more Russian troops were reported to be
crossing the Terek River, the border of a ``security zone'' federal
troops had set up around rebel-controlled southern Chechnya, and
heading towards the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian leaders gave mixed signals as to whether they would
try to take Grozny by storm. Russian and Chechen military officers
reported clashes along the Terek, and a Russian commander told NTV
television that his unit had suffered ``many casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday headed for a
meeting of European leaders in Helsinki where he could face tough
questions from an increasingly worried West over Russia's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian premier has said Moscow's quarrel is with ``illegal
bandit groups'' and ``international terrorists'' it blames for two
recent armed incursions into a neighboring southern Russian region
and a string of bomb attacks in Moscow and other cities that killed
nearly 300 people. Chechen militant leaders deny involvement in the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But as the death toll among civilians rises, the conflict is
looking increasingly like a bloody repeat of the 1994-1996 war that
killed tens of thousands and ended when Russian troops were forced
to withdraw from the region, leaving separatists in control.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft and artillery pounded Chechen positions in
three settlements north of Grozny, killing six people, Chechen
officials said. They said the southern city of Urus Martan had been
hit late Wednesday in an air strike that killed 28; overall, they
claimed nearly 60 had died.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to confirm the figures. Russian officials
often accuse the Chechens of inflating civilian death counts to
attract international attention; the Russians themselves appeared
to be exagerrating when they claimed their operation had killed
over 3,000 ``bandits'' since August. Russia admits to losing 350
men, a figure the Chechens, and some Russian lawmakers, say is
wildly deflated.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Western reporters Wednesday, Putin repeated his
claim that federal troops have no intention repeating the bloody
fiasco of its last invasion of Grozny in early 1995. But Thursday's
missile attack was only the latest indication that Russia has no
intention of sparing the capital, either.
</P>
<P>
   Another one came from Moscow's newly appointed envoy to the
region, Nikolai Koshman, who told reporters Wednesday that Grozny,
devastated during the last war, is too heavily damaged and cannot
be rebuilt. Koshman said that when the current fighting is done,
whenever that is, he would advocate building a new capital in a
different location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later federal forces will enter Grozny. If not
troops, then (Russian) authorities will,'' Russian Deputy Defense
Minister Vladimir Toporov said Thursday, adding to the speculation.
His boss, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, tried to quash it by
saying: ``Why do you keep bringing up Grozny? Who is going to storm
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Military officers and analysts agree that trying to take the
capital and its resolute defenders makes little sense.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts see two reasons why the military might try to
take the capital. One motive is revenge. Many of the generals in
the current conflict are the same ones who lost the last one. They
say that meddling politicians stole their victory.
</P>
<P>
   The other motive is politics. Putin's popularity has risen
dramatically during the conflict. To maintain that popularity for
an expected presidential run next year, he may feel the need for
the dramatic victory winning back Grozny would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main mistake of the 1994-1996 war is repeating itself,''
commented the news magazine Itogi. ``The military leaders are in
the hands of people who are first and foremost concerned with their
political careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders have avoided openly criticizing Russia but have
urged talks. Putin, whose rating in opinion polls has risen during
the campaign, has rejected talks with Chechen leader Aslan
Maskhadov unless Maskhadov hands over guerrilla leaders Moscow
blames for the bomb blasts, Shamil Basayev and the Arab-born
Khattab. On Thursday, authorities in Moscow detained Maskhadov's
representative, Mairbek Vachagayev; no explanation was given.
</P>
<P>
   But Maskhadov has little control over what Basayev and Khattab
do. And after Thursday's attack, retaliation appeared likely.

CONGRESS REBUFFS CLINTON'S DISCOUNT PLAN AS SENATE PANEL PASSES
MEDICARE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (dal) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress rebuffed a proposal by President Clinton
to steer Medicare patients to certain hospitals and medical
suppliers who offer discounted prices to the government. But
lawmakers said Thursday that they would re-examine the proposal
next year, when they consider bigger changes in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as the Senate Finance Committee approved a
bill to increase Medicare payments to many types of health care
providers, including hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics,
home health care agencies, doctors and health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, undoing some of the cuts made by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, would cost $15.4 billion over the next 10
years. The committee did not specify any way to pay for the
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. Under current law, the trust fund that pays
hospital bills for Medicare patients is scheduled to run out of
money in 2015. Under the Senate bill and under a similar measure
moving through the House, the trust fund would be depleted a year
earlier, in 2014, Medicare officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee rejected several proposals by Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., to help cover the cost by giving Medicare officials
new tools to negotiate lower prices on the goods and services they
purchase for the elderly. Graham has espoused these ideas for
several years; Clinton embraced them in June as part of his
comprehensive plan to redesign Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Medicare could save money and perhaps even improve
the quality of care by adopting some of the techniques of managed
care: sending patients to ``centers of excellence'' for complex
surgical procedures; hiring specialists to coordinate the care of
patients with diabetes and congestive heart failure; making a
single ``bundled payment'' for all the care provided to an
individual, and securing discounts through price negotiations and
competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would force health care providers to compete
against one another, in terms of the price and the quality of their
services. By contrast, Medicare is now open to virtually any
medical suppliers and providers who accept the government's fee
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee rejected the proposals, 18 to 2.
Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee have set aside
similar proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said they liked the proposals, but felt the
timing was wrong. For example, Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., said,
``If this amendment were adopted, the whole bill would bog down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said: ``I feel like Senator Chafee.
Senator Graham has some excellent ideas. I hope we'll take them up
in the context of restructuring Medicare next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House may may try to push the proposals later this
year, when the House and Senate try to resolve differences in their
Medicare bills.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, defended the
president's proposals, saying, ``These are very effective, very
reliable private sector practices that will save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart insisted: ``Quality will not be sacrificed under this
plan. Only the best and highest-quality health care providers will
be allowed to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said: ``When Congress refused to consider a prescription
drug benefit, it rendered any meaningful Medicare reform impossible
this year. The engine for true reform will be fueled next year by
the need for drug coverage under Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart M. Butler, a vice president of the Heritage Foundation,
said he saw merit in Graham's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make the fee-for-service Medicare program work in a
cost-effective way, it has to incorporate some basic techniques of
managed care, just as Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other health
plans have done,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Butler said, if the Medicare agency, the Health Care
Financing Administration, is given this new authority, it must not
be allowed to set the rules for competition between the traditional
Medicare program and managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be like an umpire in the World Series working for
one of the teams,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail R. Wilensky, chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission, which advises Congress on the health insurance program
for the elderly, said competitive bidding on standard items of
medical equipment was ``a perfectly sound strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the success of any effort to steer patients to
specific hospitals will ``depend heavily on how you define quality,
because you don't want to end up just rewarding the low bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance
Committee, blocked Democratic efforts to pay for the Medicare
package. ``This is entirely a Medicare bill,'' Roth said. ``It's
not a revenue bill.''

GOP FRONT-RUNNER IS SCARCE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ When Texas Governor George W. Bush arrives
for breakfast at the Country Kitchen restaurant in Newport Friday
morning, it will be just his fifth visit to the state this year.
</P>
<P>
   And later that night, when five of his rivals gather for a
candidate forum in Durham, Bush will be gone, having slipped across
the border to Vermont for a long-planned fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   Call him the phantom front-runner _ the candidate who easily
dominates the polls here, yet has made fewer trips to the
first-in-the-nation primary state than any other candidate except
Utah Senator Orrin G. Hatch, who lags near the back of the pack in
the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush's image has not been hurt by the fact that he has
been so seldom on the scene. But even Bush allies here voice
cautious concern that their candidate risks seeming to flout one of
the truisms of New Hampshire's primary: voters expect candidates to
court them, preferably in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is all the time he can allot to it,'' said Rhona
Charbonneau, Bush's Hillsborough County chairman and a Hudson
selectman. ``I don't know why he's not coming more to the state.
He's got to do more grassroots, not just photo ops.''
</P>
<P>
   David Currier, the vice chairman of the GOP for Belknap and
Merrimack counties, has always been a Bush man, dating back to
1980. ``I'd be remiss in not saying he should be here more,'' said
Currier, who is neutral because of his role in the party. ``But the
thing is, the more people who come in contact with him, the better
off he's going to be ultimately.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visits to New Hampshire have been relatively rare, in
part because he delayed his first campaign trip until June, when
the Texas Legislature adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates came early and often. Arizona Senator John
McCain is on his 17th visit this week; for Steve Forbes, it is his
13th visit; for Gary Bauer, his 10th. On the Democratic side, Vice
President Al Gore had made 15 Granite State trips as of Thursday;
Bill Bradley, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents, of course, are eager to make the case that the
Texas governor is pursuing the primary strategy of a cautious
front-runner, hesitant to take unscripted questions from voters or
to debate other candidates. They are quick to note that Bush has
decided not to attend Friday night's Republican debate in Durham,
favoring a party fund-raiser in Sugarbush, Vt., instead. His
campaign said he committed to that event first and it will be his
only trip to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, he will miss another GOP forum at Dartmouth College
because he wants to be on hand when his wife receives an award in
Texas. But he will attend a forum sponsored by WMUR-TV on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking the entire election for granted,'' said Richard
Lessner, the senior adviser to Gary Bauer. ``He seems to believe a
healthy lead in the polls and a potful of money means you don't
have to expose yourself to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying retail politics doesn't matter in New Hampshire,
money and my front-runner status does,'' said Paul Young, a senior
adviser to Forbes. ``We're going to find out if the voters are
going to let him get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials counter that they understand the
importance of New Hampshire-style-politicking and that Bush will be
stepping up his schedule here, with six days of campaigning planned
over the next four weeks. On top of that, he is expected to go on
the air with television advertising next Tuesday, introducing
himself to voters on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual ramping up of the campaign schedule here was always
Bush's long-term plan, said Karl Rove, his chief strategist. Rove
recently came to New Hampshire to find out what focus groups think
of Bush's advertising, his message, and of criticism of the
governor by Steve Forbes. Young said the focus groups said Bush
needs to get more engaged here, but Rove said the responses showed
the campaign is on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advertising is well received in the state and Forbes's
attacks on the stump are falling flat,'' Rove said. ``It gives us
strong evidence we're in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joel Maiola, Bush's New Hampshire director, acknowledged
that it has been a long time since the candidate visited Sept. 7-8.
Bush was supposed to return Sept. 19, but a shooting in a church in
Texas prompted him to cancel so he could attend funeral services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too long in between, but when there's a tragedy in your
home state you should be there as governor,'' said Maiola.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maiola said, the Bush campaign is taking nothing for
granted, and has organized in every ward, town and county here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of campaigns are very envious of Governor Bush's
position in New Hampshire,'' said Maiola. ``It's a sign of early
desperation to categorize his campaign as anything but
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charbonneau is a Bush backer, not an envious opponent, and
she remains a little concerned. She said she believes Bush should
be concentrating his time in the golden triangle of Nashua, Hudson,
and Londonderry, where 51 percent of the states' voters live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's got to come in more than what he's doing,''
said Charbonneau. ``Maybe they feel he doesn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidele J. Bernasconi, the editor of the Hudson-Litchfield News,
is not concerned about the number of days Bush has spent in New
Hampshire. What troubles him is that he has written to the governor
for his views on the federal funding of special education. The
Hudson school board also sent a letter, and so did the Hudson Board
of Selectmen and the Milford school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't answered anyone,'' said Bernasconi. ``I think Mr.
Bush thinks he's got it wrapped up. I think he's in for a very rude
awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   During Bush's visit to New Hampshire, he will talk to people at
a fire station chat in Newport and meet more voters at the Colony
Mills Marketplace in Keene. If his past few visits are any
indication, he is likely to draw huge crowds of people who want to
shake his hand, snap his photo, and hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, the Concord attorney who once advised Lamar
Alexander, said Bush is doing fine. Rath's last candidate,
Alexander, never seemed to leave New Hampshire after the 1996
primary. His crowds dwindled and his appeal seemed to evaporate the
more time he spent in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an expert that frequent presence does not guarantee
success,'' said Rath.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Carney, a Republican political strategist from
Peterborough, added: ``No one in February will remember that Bush
didn't come here very much this summer if he comes a lot in
January.''

 &HT;    Gore vows oil drilling ban
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rye, N.H. _ Saying he will put environmental protection ``at the
very heart of my campaign for president,'' Vice President Al Gore
said Thursday he would block all new oil drilling off the shores of
Florida and California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he selected those states because there is widespread
public opposition there to offshore drilling. He said he would work
to prevent more drilling even if companies already have been
granted leases to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move faster in a bolder way,'' Gore told a
businessman who manufactures solar energy products, one of a group
of environmentalists who met with Gore at the Seacoast Science
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated a pledge to push for ``the most sweeping
anti-sprawl legislation this country has ever seen,'' and said he
would spell out positions on other environmental issues in a series
of speeches over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day earmarked for the environment. Gore talked about
the issue with a group of children posed against a scenic beach
backdrop. He included a group of California environmentalists,
teleconferenced in from Los Angeles, in his roundtable discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also slammed Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
environmental record, saying Texas has the worst record in air,
water and land pollution. He called it ``troubling'' that Houston,
judged by the number of ozone alert days this year, now has the
nation's dirtiest air.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Bush of a ``lenient approach which has looked the
other way on the environment,'' but he declined to criticize the
environmental record of his Democratic opponent, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would do everything in his power to block drilling
off Florida and California, ``even in areas already leased for
drilling by previous administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration already has announced a 10-year
extension of a moratorium on drilling off most of the U.S. coast,
but Gore said oil companies have proposed new drilling on existing
leases.
</P>
<P>
   An industry spokesman said Gore's proposal would force companies
to find new drilling sites overseas, increasing U.S. dependence on
imported oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make such a ban really ignores the need for natural gas and
oil to be produced domestically,'' said Mark Rubin of the American
Petroleum Institute. ``The bottom line here is that because we are
limited in our access to federal lands, the companies are forced to
spend their exploration budgets overseas, and this is going to
simply further that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director of the Sierra
Club, said California and Florida are ``two highly desirable places
for complete protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore called for a ``gradual phasedown'' of the controversial
gasoline additive MBTE, and he promoted his proposal to provide $1
billion for ``smart growth'' initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there is growing evidence that his warnings about
the effects of global warming should be taken seriously. ``I find
more and more people who used to be skeptics about global warming
who now are convinced'' of the gravity of the problem, he said.

41 LAWMAKERS TO POST TEN COMMANDMENTS IN OFFICES

   WASHINGTON _ Forty-one members of Congress agreed to post the
Ten Commandments in their offices Thursday as an endorsement for
legislation that critics say dangerously treads on the separation
of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Research Council will give the members a framed copy
of the Exodus version of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   While some groups said such a campaign set a dangerous
precedent, Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, saw no problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't push religion off on anybody,'' Hall said as he stood
behind a desk with a sign that reads ``pray.'' ``I don't think it's
a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Texas Reps. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, and Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio,
also agreed to post the commandments, although the three
congressmen have yet to receive them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping religious items in the office is not a new development
for some members. Senate Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, has
kept a Bible and the commandments in his office for a couple years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that Armey and others set the sort of example that
will give Congress momentum to pass legislation eliminating
barriers between religion and school. The House passed an amendment
to a juvenile justice bill in June that would permit states to post
the commandments in public places, including schools. The bill is
now in a Senate and House conference committee, where members will
negotiate a final version of a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Catharine LeRoy, public policy director for People For the
American Way, said her organization opposes the posting of the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that this is part of a much larger campaign.
This is just sort of a symbolic piece of that whole agenda to go
against the founders of the Constitution,'' LeRoy said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1980 case, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law
requiring schools in that state to post the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the Ten Commandments amendment in the wake of
the Columbine school massacre in Littleton, Colo., in an apparent
effort to reduce violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Parshall, spokesperson for the Family Research Council,
said the group plans to capitalize on a shift in the nation's
attitude toward religion that developed after Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents wake up in the morning now days, they don't worry
about the Dow. They worry about whether their kids' school will be
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   She said critics of religion in schools are out of touch with
what Americans want.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are suffering from theo-phobia,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Describing poverty as a ``slow-motion national
disaster,'' former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey called Thursday
for reducing the number of poor children by half over the coming
decade by raising the minimum wage, increasing spending on child
care programs and providing an array of tax benefits to poor
parents who work.
</P>
<P>
   Evoking the Depression and the race to the moon as urgent
challenges the nation had overcome through ingenuity and strong
will, Bradley, who is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the
Democratic presidential nomination, said it was morally
unacceptable for a prosperous America to allow one in five of its
children to live in dire need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am issuing a simple challenge today,'' Bradley said in a
speech at the Concord Baptist Church in the Bedford Stuyvesant
section of Brooklyn. ``If we can achieve the kind of prosperity we
have, if we can change the world through our ideas and inventions,
if we can muster the will and create the technology to put a man on
the moon in a decade, then surely by all that we hold dear as
Americans we can eliminate child poverty as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been an outspoken critic of the sweeping welfare
changes enacted by Congress in 1996, his last year in the Senate,
Bradley not did propose rolling back that law's major provisions,
which include time limits on benefits and work requirements for
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he outlined a menu of programs that he said would cost
the government $14 billion a year and lift 7 million children out
of poverty over eight years. He said his proposals could be
financed using the portion of the federal surplus not earmarked for
Social Security, projected to be more than $1 trillion over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Bradley's proposals are intended to help families in
which at least one parent is employed and that live near or below
the poverty line. He would increase the minimum wage by $1, to
$6.15 an hour, over two years, and require that it automatically go
up with inflation. He would increase the earned income tax credit
for families with three or more children, and reduce marginal tax
rates on families that receive the credit.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate said he would also raise federal spending on Head
Start, the preschool program for low-income children, to $8.7
billion a year _ enough to enroll every eligible child, he said.
And he would spend $1.3 billion a year to help pay off the student
loans of 50,000 college graduates who agree to teach in low-income
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Like his call for making health insurance available to virtually
all Americans, Bradley's poverty proposals offered a somewhat more
expansive vision for government than has been proposed by his rival
for the Democratic nomination, Gore. As such, Bradley's proposals
provided further evidence of his efforts to win over his party's
liberal wing, a large, vociferous and energetic faction that often
dominates primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently trying to beat Bradley to the punch, the vice
president announced his own antipoverty program on Wednesday,
calling for increasing the minimum wage, cracking down on parents
who do not make child support payments, and making the earned
income tax credit available to more families. In the past, Gore has
also called for universal prekindergarten programs and for
financing scholarships for 10,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore's aides said Bradley had done little to
advance the vice president's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out Sen. Bradley's big ideas are Gore ideas,'' said
Kiki Moore, Gore's campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Aber, director of the National Center for Children
in Poverty at Columbia University, said he considered it
significant that Bradley had set clear goals for reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't point to a presidential candidate in 30 years who has
said, `Let's reduce poverty by this amount,''' said Aber, who
attended Bradley's speech Thursday but is not supporting any
presidential candidate. ``Gore has not put himself in that position
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Susan Eckerly, the chief Senate lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Businesses, which represents 600,000
small-business owners, said Bradley's minimum wage proposal would
do little to help the poor because the majority of the 12 million
people earning the minimum wage are teen-agers living at home or
single adults. She added that increasing the minimum wage
discourages small companies from hiring young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very blunt instrument to use to get at child
poverty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said his minimum wage and tax proposals would
typically increase the incomes of working-poor families by between
$2,000 and $3,000 a year. Poverty is defined as earning less than
$16,400 a year for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley opened his 30-minute speech Thursday with an anecdote he
often tells, in which a fourth-grade girl in Minnesota, responding
to her teacher's question about how many in the class had a big
breakfast, replies, ``It wasn't my turn to eat today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the founders of our Republic said that life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness were the unalienable right of all
Americans, they didn't say anything about taking turns,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he has throughout the campaign, Bradley said the Clinton
administration had not done enough to reduce poverty. Although
there are nearly 2 million fewer children in poverty today than
when Clinton and Gore entered office in 1993, Bradley said the
improvement was ``small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in an indifferent moral universe can we feel satisfied
with ourselves for lifting a small percentage of children out of
poverty,'' he said. ``When there is a great natural disaster, a
hurricane or a flood, we don't talk about repairing a roof here and
a window there, a house here and a bridge there. We talk about a
wholesale rescue effort.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on poverty said the most important element of
Bradley's plan was his proposal to expand the earned income tax
credit, which is intended to encourage poor parents to work. Under
current policy, a refundable credit of up to $3,816 a year is given
to families with two or more children. The credit is gradually
phased out for families earning from $12,400 to $30,580 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would give larger families more money: $4,500 a year for
families with three or more children. He would also phase out the
credit at a slower rate, so that families earning higher incomes
could keep more of it. And he would eliminate a glitch in the
policy that reduces the credit for married couples filing joint tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Among other elements of Bradley's plan are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ An increase in federal subsidies for day care programs by $1
billion a year, enough to provide care for an additional 420,000
low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   _ A proposal to make an existing tax credit for child care
expenses refundable, so that low-income families with no tax
liabilities would receive government checks to cover their costs
for day care and other family expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program to create 2,000 community centers, at a cost of $1
billion a year, to provide after-school services and activities for
latch-key children.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he would spend $300 million a year to create
550 group homes for poor teen-age girls during their pregnancies
and for one year after childbirth.

RAYTHEON REPORTS $169 MILLION NET LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. on Thursday reported a third-quarter net loss of
$169 million after charges because of delayed orders and shrinking
oversees profits.
</P>
<P>
   The loss for the Lexington, Mass., defense contractor was in
line with warnings it issued last week, and came despite a 7
percent rise in total sales for the three months ended Oct. 3.
Those revenues totaled $4.7 billion, up from $4.4 billion for the
same period a year ago with the hike driven by more payments from
defense and engineering programs.
</P>
<P>
   But fiercer competition forced down margins on some of those
projects, the company said. Raytheon also included a pretax charge
of $599 million for the period to account for disappointing
international orders, construction delays, and problems at a unit
of its Raytheon Aircraft Co. that retrofits jets for business
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said it will take pretax charges of about $39
million in the fourth quarter, and about $30 million in the first
quarter of 2000, as previously estimated. Some of these charges
will cover severance payments to about 2,380 workers the company
previously said it plans to lay off, including about 340 at
facilities in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's loss for the quarter of 50 cents per diluted share,
compared to a profit of $11 million, or 3 cents per diluted share,
for the same period a year ago after charges.
</P>
<P>
   The latest loss comes as Raytheon tries to assimilate defense
units purchased from Texas Instruments Inc. and Hughes Electronics
Corp. two years ago. The acquisitions doubled the company's size
but have yet to produce the big profit margins forecast by Raytheon
CEO Daniel Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the expected charges last week, Burnham conceded the
company's integration efforts ``tried to do too much too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's advance warning of growing losses sent the company's
shares down 44 percent on Oct. 12, to close at 24 1/4, a fraction
of the high of 74 15/16 reached in July. Raytheon closed Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange at 29 1/4, up 3/16 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts earlier expected the company to earn up to $4 a share
next year, but reduced their forecasts almost by half after last
week's warnings. Thursday's formal earnings report including ``no
surprises,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Reserach Inc. in
Newport, R.I., but underscored how much ground Raytheon must still
make up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is half as bright as it was before last week,''
Nesbit said. He said he hopes the company might trade around $36 a
share by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Among its problems Raytheon cited slower-than-expected orders
for its Patriot ground-to-air missile from customers such as Greece
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot orders can bring in $1 billion apiece, but Thursday, in
a conference call with analysts and reporters, Raytheon chief
financial officer Frank Caine said the company expects between $600
million and $700 million in revenues from the Patriot this year,
slightly below expectations, and less next year.
</P>
<P>
   To offset those declines, Raytheon has vowed to cut more costs.
</P>
<P>
   Caine said he also plans to hire an outside company to conduct
internal audits. ``More frequent and more direct business reviews
are becoming part of the landscape here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caine said the company also will continue paying down debt it
took on to complete its acquisitions, expecting to have about $9.3
billion still outstanding at the end of the year, compared with
about $10.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.

 &HT;    Storm effects gnaw at strong G-P profit
 &HT;    By Patti Bond

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific Group has enjoyed a good run in
building products this year, although the boon may fade as the year
ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company turned in a strong third-quarter
profit report Thursday, thanks to surging home construction in late
summer. But price drops and effects of Hurricane Floyd hurt
earnings at the end of the quarter, and these problems could
linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a confluence of events in the last few weeks
that have taken some of the bloom off the rose,'' incoming Chief
Financial Officer Danny Huff said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific shut down several plywood plants and lumber
mills because of flooding and wet weather from Hurricane Floyd and
other storms. Some mills are still closed, Huff said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, prices for lumber and structural panels took a
``precipitous drop'' that crunched inventories near the end of the
quarter, he said. The sharp declines are expected to hurt the
company's fourth-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Group's stock closed Thursday at $38, down
$1.75, or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Huff said lumber prices should flatten out as the fourth quarter
progresses and as weather-related effects begin to subside.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, some analysts cut their estimates for the third
quarter due to concerns about higher prices and bad weather.
Georgia-Pacific Group, which excludes the company's timber
business, beat those reduced estimates. The company posted
third-quarter net income of $230 million, or $1.31 a share, against
the year-ago profit of $39 million, or 22 cents a share.
Georgia-Pacific was expected to earn $1.22 a share, based on a
survey of analysts by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the company to earn $1 a share in the fourth
quarter, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The projected slowdown in building products will be offset by
the company's surging pulp and paper business, analysts said. In
the third quarter, operating profit in Georgia-Pacific's pulp and
paper segment rose sharply to $81 million, compared with $18
million one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's new paper distribution segment reported profit
of $43 million. Huff said profit will likely decrease in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's timber business beat expectations. Timber Co.
posted net income of $49 million, or 59 cents a share, compared
with $41 million, or 46 cents a share in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. was expected to earn 49 cents a share, according to
First Call. The stock closed at $23.56 1/4, up 12 1/2 cents.

OPPOSITION LEADER CHOSEN TO BE INDONESIA'S VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The day after voting down her bid for the
presidency, the National Assembly on Thursday elected Megawati
Sukarnoputri, a popular leader of the opposition to the ousted
Suharto regime, to the post of vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of reconciliation _ and of pragmatic politics _
Mrs. Megawati was nominated for the post by the frail Muslim leader
chosen over her as president, Abdurrahman Wahid. Mrs. Megawati's
defeat on Wednesday fired an angry protest by her bitterly
frustrated supporters, and they had massed in the streets again
during Thursday's parliamentary session, threatening more violence
if she lost.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Mrs. Megawati _ the daughter of Indonesia's founding
leader, Sukarno _ stood before the assembly on Thursday evening in
a lavender silk dress to take her oath of office, her supporters
paraded through the dark streets of the capital, gunning their
motorcycles, setting off firecrackers and shouting her nickname,
``Mega! Mega!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati, who had appeared to be reluctant and unskilled at
back-room maneuvering and was visibly uncomfortable during the
parliamentary votes, seemed at ease on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   She paid special tribute to the students and others whose
stubborn and often dangerous protests had helped bring down Suharto
17 months ago and had championed her candidacy in the months since
then.
</P>
<P>
   But now, she said, the time had come to restore normalcy and
calm to a nation that has remained on edge as the political and
social forces released by the departure of a dictator threatened to
tear it apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all my children throughout the nation, I beg you sincerely
to return to work,'' she said. ``Do not be goaded into emotional
actions, because what you see here today is your mother standing
before you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the voting, Mrs. Megawati defeated the leader of an
influential Moslem party, Hamzah Haz, by a vote of 396-284, with
five abstentions. That ballot followed more closed-door maneuvers
in which two stronger challengers were persuaded to withdraw _
Akbar Tanjung, the leader of the old Suharto party, Golkar, and
General Wiranto, the military chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The voting on Thursday was accompanied by cheers, chants,
prayers and finally the tearful singing of the national anthem. It
was an outpouring of emotion that seemed to reflect a sense of
relief that Indonesia had weathered a long and turbulent transition
from the repressive autocracy of Suharto to a government that was
beginning to listen to the voices of its people.
</P>
<P>
   But some Indonesians who have struggled hard for reform said
this was still not the kind of democracy they had been working for.
Mrs. Megawati won a plurality of 34 percent in a general election
in June but was defeated by Wahid _ the fourth-place finisher _ in
the closed-door horse trading of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a very difficult day for us; yesterday was a
demonstration that the election did not mean anything,'' said Emmy
Hafild, an environmental campaigner, referring to the vote in June.
``The political elites are the ones who decide the outcome, and not
the election. I know this is the best we can do for now, but it's
hard to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Though enormously popular among Indonesians and respected for
his championship of tolerance, Wahid is largely untested as a
national leader, and in poor health. In contrast to Mrs. Megawati,
whose politics were defined largely by opposition to Suharto, Wahid
is regarded as his own man, as one of the few major figures in
Indonesia who gained prominence independent of either his
connection with or opposition to the Suharto government.
</P>
<P>
   The hermetic corridors of power are an arena where Wahid has
shown himself a master _ a man who can joke and jive his way into
seemingly mutually exclusive partnerships as he did in the past,
simultaneously embracing Suharto and Mrs. Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   But now he faces the tasks of charting a new course, choosing a
Cabinet, forging political alliances and seeking solutions to a
daunting array of problems that have been largely set aside over
the past months of political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As he does so, he will need to satisfy the unlikely coalition of
Muslim parties, old-guard members of Suharto's party and possibly
the military, which gave him his victory in the secret ballot on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has maintained good relations with the armed forces and
was expected to be able to work well with it. But in Indonesia's
militarized society, with the loss of East Timor still a source of
great bitterness to many officers, the military was certain to
remain a force to reckon with.

COMMENTARY: LET RUDY BE RUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudolph Giuliani needs to sit down and take deep
breaths before he decides to run for the Senate. Sure, he could
probably do the job. Don't worry about people who tell you he lacks
a collegial temperament. Have you seen the Senate lately? Half the
members are impossible and the other half are in a permanent sulk
because they aren't president.
</P>
<P>
   But would he be happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``If people agree with what I've done ... That's exactly the job
I'd do in the Senate,'' Giuliani told 1,600 people at a Women for
Rudy fund-raiser Thursday, offering his traditional rundown of his
fights against crime and city bureaucrats. It was hard to figure
out how he'd employ those skills in the Capitol, unless he is
planning to arrest Ted Kennedy for jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was fine if you wanted to hear about the mayor's war
against taxi drivers, the war against drug dealers, the war against
welfare agency bureaucrats, and of course the current
all-engrossing war against the Atlanta Braves. But it was a wee bit
short on signals about exactly what he was interested in doing in
Washington, or even any strong indication that he was aware the
planet extended beyond the bounds of New York City, the place
Giuliani likes to call Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Susan Molinari, who served as master of ceremonies,
also seemed a bit befuddled. She rhapsodized about his performance
on the present job. (``Mayor Giuliani is there, no matter what
problems confront us, whether it's traffic or crimes or fire.'')
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to switch gears, Ms. Molinari had trouble
rounding the rhetorical bend. She settled for urging the guests to
make sure ``whoever we send to the U.S. Senate has the dignity, the
honesty, the courage to work to make sure that New York State is in
the best hands it can possibly be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the state. Can you imagine how much fun it would be to
have Rudy Giuliani as governor of New York? You could sell tickets.
All the agencies would be headed by former assistant federal
prosecutors _ think of the excitement in the highway department
alone. The traditional decision-making by three guys in a room
would be replaced by one guy with a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has been showing signs of burnout lately, probably
because there is no longer anyone left in the city of New York with
the energy to fight with him, nobody left he can sue all the way to
the Supreme Court, a body that by now must have a separate wing for
its Giuliani files. You can't tell me he doesn't fantasize about
what it would be like to go to Albany, where the legislators and
bureaucrats still confidently walk around with their soft
underbellies exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Republicans have certainly fantasized about what it
would be like to have Rudy Giuliani at the helm of state
government, and it was that very image that caused most of them to
endorse Giuliani for a job that would ship him far, far away in the
opposite direction. But they still expect the mayor to show that if
he went to Washington, he would demonstrate some modicum of party
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Giuliani, the Republican senators have been
behaving lately in a manner calculated not only to terrify soccer
moms, but frighten the hockey dads as well. Thanks to Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, the mayor has loyally gone on the
record as saying he would have voted against the nuclear test ban
treaty last week.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been forced to announce that he thought the $792
billion Republican tax cut would have been ``great'' and that he
has grave, grave reservations about raising the minimum wage. If
Lott wants to do Giuliani any more favors, perhaps he could try
banning the Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani has always been an apolitical crusader at heart.
It's almost painful to watch him trying to bow to the yoke of party
discipline after a lifetime of making other people obey his rules.
It's too bad cities can't hire mayors, the way they used to hire
sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani could make a career of riding from town to town,
pummeling every municipality in America into perfect order, one by
one. If Hillary Clinton can be a candidate in New York, Rudy
Giuliani ought to be allowed to run in Baltimore or San Francisco.

OVERHAUL IS SET FOR POPULAR INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the Internet's most powerful search engines is getting an
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony in New York on Monday, AltaVista Co. will reveal a
major redesign of its service, with enhanced shopping and
multimedia search features, and an expanded listing of Web pages.
CMGI Inc., which bought 83 percent of AltaVista in June, is buffing
up the site for a planned public stock offering early next year.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, based in Andover, Mass., also hopes to attract a new level
of public interest in AltaVista. The site has a strong reputation
for comprehensive Internet searches; according to the Web-site
rating firm Media Metrix, AltaVista attracted 9 million visitors in
August, making it the 15th most-visited site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that puts AltaVista far behind industry
leader Yahoo, with its 33 million visitors, or even the 14.8
million visitors of eighth-ranked Lycos, of which CMGI holds a 17
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista executives refuse to speak directly about their site's
makeover, but industry-watchers who've seen it say major efforts
have been made to simplify Web searching. AltaVista's powerful
search technology often turns up tens of thousands of ``hits'' for
every inquiry _ far too much information to be truly useful. One
source who insisted on anonymity says that the new AltaVista will
offer categorization features to make it easier for users to narrow
down their searches.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Cassar, an analyst for Jupiter Communications Inc. in New
York, said AltaVista has made major changes in its Internet
shopping services. Up to now, AltaVista has featured merchandise
sold by Shopping.com, an Internet retailer purchased by AltaVista's
former parent company, Compaq Computer Corp., earlier this year.
CMGI acquired Shopping.com along with AltaVista, and in the process
picked up a few new headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping.com didn't have the best reputation in the world,''
said Cassar. Before Compaq and then CMGI bought the company, the
Better Business Bureau had received hundreds of complaints against
Shopping.com related to late delivery of purchased items.
</P>
<P>
   Cassar says that in the new AltaVista shopping portal,
Shopping.com will be merely one of many merchants on the site.
Visitors in search of a particular item will be able to shop a
number of on-line stores simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an improvement over what they have now,'' said
Cassar.
</P>
<P>
   But Cassar also noted that the new shopping feature won't be
much different from existing services from Yahoo or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting to me,'' he said, ``is that the commerce
sites and the portals have all started to look a lot like each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Bane, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, agrees
that major portals have all rushed to offer similar features, until
it's difficult to distinguish one from the other. But after seeing
a preview of the new AltaVista, Bane said the redesigned site will
be easier to use than many of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market's going to be pleasantly surprised with
AltaVista,'' Bane said.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista isn't an island. CMGI owns interests in about 50
Internet companies ranging from on-line merchants to software
developers, and CMGI chairman David Wetherell is determined to
weave them into an integrated network of companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, CMGI recently acquired Engage Technologies Inc.,
which creates anonymous profiles of Web surfers that can be used to
precisely target advertising to likely customers. AltaVista will
use Engage's software to collect profile data on its millions of
visitors; the site also will use the Engage profiles to govern
which ads are displayed on visitors' computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   If the new look at AltaVista leads to more visitors, this can't
help but improve prospects for the planned IPO, said Ullas Naik,
who tracks Internet firms for First Albany Corp. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that they acquired this property for $2.5 billion and
could spin it off for a valuation somewhere north of $4 billion, is
a pretty good return on investment,'' Naik said.

<P>
   Good news: Researchers think the adult brain generates new cells
every day. The previously accepted theory had been that man gets a
set allotment of neurons and when they go, they go.
</P>
<P>
   Many a person celebrating a birthday beyond age 40 has reflected
upon the state of his or her brain cells and wondered about the
count, particularly when celebrating with alcohol, which, according
to a report that came out a few years ago, depletes the supply with
each glass.
</P>
<P>
   But Princeton biologists, who published their findings in the
journal Science last week, gave the world the happy news that in
monkeys, at least _ and most likely in human beings, although that
research has yet to be done _ new brain cells just keep on coming,
like fresh air. They grow in the stem cell region of the brain and
spread to the areas of the cortex involving memory and decision-
making.
</P>
<P>
   The findings offer hope to people with degenerative diseases,
for someday scientists may be able to direct new cells into any
part of the brain that is deteriorating. The report also punctures
dreary conventional wisdom about aging, for brain cells need no
longer be thought of as the mental equivalent of fading flashlight
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Positive brain news is always a relief because most people
understand little of what is going on up there. They use their
brains the way they drive their cars _ the stuff under the hood is
incomprehensible, but if somebody tells them they're getting better
mileage than they thought, they're delighted.
</P>
<P>
   The brain is a kind of Oz, a fantastic kingdom that scientists
keep probing, much like scouts on the frontier. Periodically they
report back, announcing that people are using only a fraction of
the space. Such reports are always worrisome. But envisioning a
cavalry of vigorous neurological reinforcements galloping to the
aid of anyone having a ``senior moment'' can put a spring in a
person's step and a smile on one's face.

THE BOTTOM LINE IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The corrupting influence of money in American politics is on
dramatic display.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, senators who benefit disproportionately from
special-interest campaign contributions killed a bill to make
politics fairer and more open to average voters.
</P>
<P>
   At least the senators got to vote. Wednesday morning, dollars
actually supplanted votes as a financially strapped Elizabeth Dole
ended her presidential candidacy before a single ballot had been
cast. ``In the real America, it's more important to raise issues
than to raise campaign funds,'' she said. But in a national
campaign, ``the bottom line remains money.''
</P>
<P>
   This ugly chapter began last week when Senator Mitch McConnell
challenged Senator John McCain, a lead proponent of reform, to back
up his charges that the system is corrupt by naming names. McCain
wisely demurred; his target is the system, not specific people.
Still, examples are rife:
</P>
<P>
   --On June 22, airlines contributed $115,000 in soft money to
Republican committees. The next day, a Senate committee gutted a
strong passenger rights bill, essentially making it voluntary.
Before night, the airlines contributed $95,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   --Out of the many questionable contributions to President
Clinton's reelection campaign, a House committee has pointed to
$220,000 from Yah Lin Trie and his family as possibly influencing
administration policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   --Walt Disney CEO Michael Eisner gave $1,000 to Senator Trent
Lott the very day Lott signed onto a bill extending the copyright
on Mickey Mouse. Disney sent $25,000 more to a GOP group later.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell can argue all he wants that the influence of campaign
donations does not meet the legal definition of bribery. Sometimes
outright bribery does occur, but the point of reform is to change a
system that is corrupted legally.
</P>
<P>
   Congress demonstrates every day that special interests can buy
results. More broadly, Dole's departure shows how big money is
stealing democracy from the people. That is corruption or the word
has lost all meaning.

SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health care financing in the United States is a mess. Pending an
overhaul that encourages every American to obtain health insurance
and spreads the cost of care across the population, the federal
government should not hack away at programs that sustain important
medical institutions. Congress would be wise to restore some of the
cutbacks affecting hospitals, especially those that train the next
generation of physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means
Committee are working on proposals that would undo some of the
damage caused by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law was
essential for fiscal stability, but many members of Congress agree
that it went too far. With the economy strong and Medicare spending
less than expected, it is time to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee is considering a bill that would
make many health care improvements, chief among them an extra $1.2
billion over five years for outpatient services. A key feature of
the Finance Committee bill is its allocation of $1.8 billion more
to train physicians. The final bill ought to provide significant
support for medical education.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare bears a disproportionate burden in supporting hospitals
and medical education because it is the only federal program that
covers the health care needs of a large cross-section of the
population. If Congress extends the same opportunity for coverage
to other Americans, it would be appropriate to consider changing
the funding mechanism for hospitals. Until that time comes,
Congress needs to make sure Medicare provides enough support to
maintain the financial health of these vital institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHINO, Calif. _ Nearly four decades ago, Gennie DeBoer was one
of many dairy farmers forced by relentless urbanization to flee the
farmland in Los Angeles County where her immigrant parents had
settled, and to build a new life elsewhere. Hard as it was, the
move turned out to be a blessing with unexpected results.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. DeBoer and many of the other dairy refugees eventually
built state-of-the-art milking operations here in what was then a
sun-baked wasteland, 40 miles east of the spires of downtown Los
Angeles. In short order, they helped transform the near desert into
something few outside the area had a clue about: One of the most
densely worked and productive dairy regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The huge, computerized dairy farms shoehorned into a relatively
small area in the Chino Valley in San Bernardino County would come
to play a major role in California's little-known leap ahead of
Wisconsin several years ago as the country's largest milk-producing
state, a marvel of automation and high yields. But as Mrs. DeBoer
recounted her success recently and drove a visitor past one giant
herd after another in her Lexus, the air redolent of the aromas
generated by tens of thousands of Holsteins in close quarters, she
said with only a touch of nostalgia, and even a sense of relief,
that it was all about to vanish _ a victim, yet again, of Southern
California's urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian who doctored her herds has moved, she said,
pointing to a large subdivision that sprang up across the street
from his house. She drove past a number of other new clusters of
tract housing and several new shopping centers within sight, and
scent, of the bustling milking barns that once dominated a
landscape whose tallest features are hillocks of manure.
</P>
<P>
   So as this area quickly enters the clutching suburban embrace of
a booming Los Angeles, Mrs. DeBoer has become part of yet another
exodus of a big portion of the state's dairies, like factories on
wheels whose machines happen to be hulking black and white animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl is forcing many unwanted changes in urban regions across
the country. But in Southern California sprawl has been such a
constant dynamic in the area's restless geometry of growth,
especially in the post-war era, that it is not always an enemy to
many of those whose lives are uprooted by it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Chino Valley dairy farmers, the surge of new
subdivisions is actually injecting new vitality into one of the
state's largest industries. Many of the farmers here are selling
outmoded facilities and are using ample profits from their valuable
tracts of land to build even larger and more efficient operations
in more bucolic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The big increase in land values, as demand for new housing
soars, is financing a transition that will result for most people
not in broken dreams or the end of a way of life, but in a new
generation of highly efficient dairies. As a result, California
seems likely to substantially widen its lead over Wisconsin and the
No. 3 dairy state, New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, the spread of all those new subdivisions and
their backyard swimming pools has proved something of a boon to the
dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, everything here is outdated,'' Mrs. DeBoer said, as she
strolled through a barn rich with the sweet-sour smell of fresh
milk. ``In this business, you have to go forward, or you're going
backward. You have to keep growing. You have to strive to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. DeBoer is planning to sell her 200 acres, estimated to be
worth about $100,000 an acre, and move her 2,000 cows to an
efficient new farm she owns with a son about 180 miles north in
Tulare County, which is now the state's fastest-growing dairy
region. The 2,000 acres she owns up there, she said, cost only
about $2,500 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made all this possible in the Chino Valley was the money
the farmers got from selling their land in Los Angeles,'' said
Robert Feenstra, the son of a Los Angeles dairyman and the
executive director of the Milk Producers Council, the industry
trade group here. ``The process of urbanization in Los Angeles
pushed the land prices up so much that it accelerated the growth of
the industry out here. The farmers came with the capital to build
these really efficient operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Feenstra pointed to a new addition to his office wall, a map of
Tulare County replete with red dots representing dairy farms, and
added, ``They're doing the same thing all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The nearby city of Ontario is about to complete the annexation
of much of this area next month and press ahead with the
construction of subdivisions named, in a touch of fanciful
marketing, for the properties they are replacing, like Cloverdale
Farms and Archibald Ranch. The farmers are looking to the future,
and even many of those who say they intend to stay are
unsentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here see it as part of the business process,'' said
Fred Aguiar, a former mayor of Chino who moved here from a dairy in
Los Angeles County four decades ago and is now a San Bernardino
County supervisor. ``Where you have half a million animals now,
there will be 100,000 or so people in a few years. We all
understand progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Koopman, who sold his farm here last year and now spends a
week a month on a big dairy he partly owns in New Mexico, agreed.
``It'll be a little sad to see everyone go,'' Koopman said, ``but
it makes sense from a business and environmental perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is even a sense among some farmers that, good as Chino has
been to them economically, the growth of the dairy business was too
concentrated. The current ratio of about 25 cows to an acre here is
among the highest in the world. That has created environmental
concerns that at least some of the farmers will be glad to leave
behind when they move to more spacious farms that, for now at
least, are miles from the nearest subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these farms ever should have been here really,'' said
Mrs. DeBoer, as she pointed to the berms thrown up around many of
the fields in an effort to contain the dangerous wash of manure and
water spread by winter floods. ``No one ever thought about the
future. It was way too dense. What happened here will never happen
again, anywhere in the world. The county closed their eyes to what
was happening in the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the development of modern refrigeration, processing and
filtration methods, dairy farms needed to be closer to their
markets, so in the early part of the century a big arc in
southeastern Los Angeles County became home to a cluster of farms
feeding the appetites of a rapidly growing metropolis.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I built a small workbench in my garage where I work on my
hobby of building model boats. I use several different types of
small electric tools and small lamps in my work.
</P>
<P>
   There is an electric outlet on the wall nearby, but this is
really not enough as I need to have three or four tools and
appliances plugged in at the same time, so I have been using an
extension cord and multiple plugs.
</P>
<P>
   This is messy (too many wires and plugs that keep falling out)
and probably unsafe. Is there a better _ and safer _ solution you
can suggest without having to pay for an expensive electrician?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can buy multiple-outlet strips that can be permanently
mounted on a wall or other surface. These are connected by a
flexible extension cord to an existing outlet so that you can plug
in anywhere from four to six separate tools or appliances at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   However, all the electrical plugs will be relatively close to
each other (such strips usually vary from about 12 to 18 inches in
length) which is not always convenient.
</P>
<P>
   A better and more permanent solution is to install some
``surface wiring'' of the type shown here. Available at all home
centers, this system consists of surface-mounted raceways or
channels that contain the wires on the inside and permit you to add
as many outlets as desired.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that this does not increase the amount of power
available (if you connect up to a 15 amp circuit you will still
have a total of only 15 amps available).
</P>
<P>
   The raceway starts at an existing wall outlet and is ``hard
wired'' (permanently connected) to that outlet. A switch can be
installed as shown to control power to the new receptacles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My basement walls are made of cement block and there is a
white chalky powder on the surface near the bottom of two walls.
What is this material and what if anything should I do to get rid
of it before I paint?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is undoubtedly efflorescence _ a condition often
encountered in masonry when there is moisture present. Alkaline
salts which are always present in masonry are leached out by the
moisture and this is what you see.
</P>
<P>
   The efflorescence should be removed before painting by scrubbing
with a dilute solution of muriatic acid (one part acid to five
parts water). Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands and goggles
to protect your eyes. Rinse off with lots of water.
</P>
<P>
   However, the condition could return (even after painting) if you
don't get rid of the moisture problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have plastic covered kitchen cabinets with a wood finish.
The cabinets are in good condition but some of the doors are sticky
around the knobs due to handling. Ordinary washing doesn't seem to
remove this. What can you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's likely that this is simply grease and soil, possibly
embedded in the wax or polish that you have applied to the cabinets
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The sticky residue can usually be removed by washing with a
household detergent or spray cleaner, but if this doesn't do the
trick then you can clean it off by wiping down with a solvent such
as paint thinner. This is highly flammable so make sure you observe
all precautions against fire.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a good idea to test the solvent first on an
inconspicuous corner to make certain it will not affect the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a plumbing problem in our new house. When someone is
in the shower and a person runs the cold water somewhere else in
the house, the shower turns scalding hot, while if that person runs
the hot water, the shower suddenly runs cold. What causes this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is possible that the water pipes are not large enough to
provide a full flow of water to more than one fixture at a time.
</P>
<P>
   An even more likely cause is that the incoming water pressure
from the main line is not adequate to provide a full flow of water.
You should have your local water company check this.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot solve the problem then you may want to think about
having a special temperature-controlled shower valve installed
(this will control the temperature regardless of pressure
variations).
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets

 CHINO, Calif.: growing metropolis.

   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dairying became so important to the local economy that when a
county seal was created in the 1950s, the business was honored on
the emblem. On the seal were figures representing the pillars of
the local economy, including, among other things, an oil well, a
tuna and a cow. Her name was Pearlette.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its density, another quirk of the dairy industry
here was that it was operated almost entirely by immigrants. The
largest group were Dutch immigrants, many of whom came before and
just after World War II and quickly adapted their northern European
techniques to the hot, dry climate. In addition, there were many
Portuguese immigrants, mostly from the Azores, and a handful of
French Basque farmers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, many farmers, like Mrs. DeBoer and her husband,
Fred, still speak Dutch and visit relatives in their homeland
periodically. They also have built extremely tight-knit
communities, with their own churches and schools. To this day, the
industry in Southern California is dominated by the Dutch, and the
dairy industry in northern California, toward the top of the
Central Valley, is dominated by Portuguese families. As the Dutch
immigrants in Chino have moved to Tulare, among the first things
they have done is construct a new network of churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the industry was forced to move, it also pulled up
stakes in a hurry. Joel Splansky, a professor of geography at
California State University at Long Beach and the author of a
history of the dairy business here, said that as recently as 1962
the town of Dairy Valley, one of the centers of the industry in Los
Angeles County, had 3,505 people and 85,000 cows.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long after that that rising taxes, changing policies
regarding the use of land and environmental concerns over growing
manure piles forced the farmers to build their larger and more
efficient operations in the Chino Valley. Today, the town of Dairy
Valley is called Cerritos. It has a population of 53,240 people,
and no cows.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the growth of the industry in the Chino Valley was
encouraged; there were few restrictions or environmental concerns.
There are now about 880 cows on average on each farm in Chino, with
many having 2,000 or so, compared with a national average of fewer
than 50 cows per farm.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The farms are operated with machine-like precision and a pure
business philosophy. Asked if their cows had names, the farmers
here chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a lot of those farms in the Midwest and back East, every
cow has a name,'' Koopman said. ``They're sort of pets. It's not
like that here. A cow's a piece of machinery. If it's broke, we try
to fix it, and if we can't, it gets replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, every cow has a number and a page on the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. DeBoer said she has never milked a cow by hand, and never
expects to. In the factory that is her barn, the employees, almost
entirely Latino, manage the incessantly humming machinery. ``It's
just a factory is what it is,'' she said. ``If the cows don't
produce milk, they go to beef.''
</P>
<P>
   One result is a conspicuous flow of wealth to the north. Modern
milking plants cost about $5 million to build in Tulare, but the
farmers, and their bankers, think nothing of constructing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the most profitable times ever,'' said Larry
Zivelonghi, manager of agricultural lending at the Citizens
Business Bank, the biggest local farm lender here. ``Feed costs are
low, milk prices are high. There's a lot of money going to these
farmers now.''
</P>
<P>
   The average farm here, Zivelonghi said, generates about $250,000
to $300,000 a month in milk sales, and loan default rates have been
minimal. ``The risk of lending in this business has been nominal,
almost zero,'' he said. ``I don't know how many businesses you can
say that about.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the barns are being replaced with handsomely designed
entry gates topped with fluttering sales banners and signs offering
houses at $200,000 and up. Within a mile or so of Mrs. DeBoer's
farm are several new shopping centers with everything from a giant
Ralphs supermarket to a handful of dry cleaning shops, a Tasty Wok
restaurant and a 24-hour fitness club.
</P>
<P>
   A huge billboard in front of a 360-acre spread bulldozed
billiard-table smooth, proclaims: ``The Corona Valley. Worth the
Wait.'' The former dairy is being turned into a planned community.
</P>
<P>
   Such grandiose projects have accelerated the county's pressure
on the remaining farmers to clean up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the farms are surrounded by berms meant to contain the
spread of water contaminated with manure when it floods in the
winter. The county is also demanding that the dairies ship out the
900,000 tons of manure they produce every year, as well as the 2
million tons of manure currently stockpiled in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 25 years I resisted it,'' said Feenstra, of the Milk
Producers Council. ``We finally realized we needed to take some
responsibility. Within maybe five years, this will be largely
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's a way of life for these people. It's a gene.
But it's not the land, it's the business they love.''

A NEW LEADER IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indonesia, the nation most battered by the Asian financial
collapse of 1998, has selected a new president, the moderate Muslim
leader Abdurrahman Wahid. A respected advocate for pluralism and
human rights, Wahid will confront two interlaced challenges: to
nurture the nascent institutions of democracy and to make the
structural changes needed to convert Indonesia from a thieves'
paradise into a modern market economy endowed with the transparency
and accountability that can attract investors, create jobs, and
lift millions of people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Wahid's selection by an Assembly vote of 373
to 313, Indonesian markets exhibited anxieties about his health. He
has suffered a stroke and is nearly blind. But the more salient
concern should be for Indonesia's rehabilitation from the
authoritarian system presided over by the strongman Suharto, who
used his nearly absolute power to enrich his family and his inner
circle for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   As unruly as the selection process may have been and as
resentful as supporters of candidate Megawati Sukarnoputri are that
she was not selected, Wahid becomes the first Indonesian leader
since independence to be selected in a free and contested election.
The Assembly that picked him also made the praiseworthy gesture of
ratifying East Timor's overwhelming vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   If Wahid is to succeed in establishing a durable democratic
polity for Indonesia, he will have to circumscribe the powers of
the military. The most promising sign Wahid could give of his
willingness to establish civilian control over the military would
be to end cross-border raids into East Timor by army-backed
militias operating out of Indonesian territory in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever came to power in present-day Indonesia &UR;  &LR; would confront
the same need to cultivate democratic values and institutions,
cauterize the old culture of corruption, and create a national
unity rooted not in coercion but in the principles of fairness,
freedom, and representative government. Indonesians deserve a
leader who is up to this challenge.

 &HT;    Cigar trend up in smoke
 &HT;    By Sheryll Poe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The cigar craze has burned itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Cigars had enjoyed a trendy revival in the late 1990s, in part
due to glossy magazines like ``Cigar Aficionado,'' which featured
hot Hollywood stars like Demi Moore and Sylvester Stallone smoking
stogies.
</P>
<P>
   But for 1999, analysts predict a 10 percent fall in sales of
premium cigars. Three cigar companies _ JR Cigar Inc., General
Cigar Holdings and Dimon Inc. _ reported quarterly revenues down
significantly from the same period in 1998. Holt's, another cigar
company, saw its stock downgraded by Prudential Bache.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with extra money, the techies, today they like
martinis, jazz and cigars, tomorrow it's cars. They get bored too
easily,'' said Charlie Guluzian, owner of the Cigar Palace in
downtown Austin. ``The trend was because of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cigar business crested in 1964, when Americans were smoking
9 billion yearly. By 1992, government health warnings had caused
the industry to fall some 77 percent, to 2.1 billion cigars yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, things changed. There was a 14.6 percent jump in
sales in 1994, followed by a 31 percent rise in 1995. In 1996,
sales of premium, hand-rolled cigars jumped 67 percent. In 1997,
they leaped another 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cigar Association of America didn't compile figures for
1998. But, two years later, retailers and cigar manufacturers
report that fewer people are lighting up. The ``cigar great
awakening'' was bound to crash, said Gerald Celente of Trends
Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. The boom was
marketing-driven, rather than consumer-driven, and reality couldn't
sustain the imagery, he said, especially among women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfeminine, and they stink,'' he said. ``Despite all
the hype and the glossy advertising, women were never going to
become cigar smokers en masse.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigar smoking has a heavy ``repulse factor'' that makes cigar
smokers a nuisance at parties and restaurants, Celente said.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't slowing down Guluzian. He plans to open a
10,000-square-foot Cuban club called Club Bolivar in December. The
club, to be located above the Cigar Palace, will feature cigars
from the store. A yearly membership will go for $5,000. Guluzian
said he has already had enough commitments from potential members
to assure the club's success. Mark Tiedeken, manager for Market
Wine &AMP; Spirits in Round Rock, said he has a lot of longtime
customers. ``Our sales are increasing,'' he said, ``but the trend
part is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Market Wine &AMP; Spirits expanded its humidor in February, adding
200 square feet, and is considering expanding again.
</P>
<P>
   Chet Butler, general manager of the Speakeasy cigar bar, which
opened in 1997, attributes the slowdown to a decrease in excess and
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swing thing slowed down at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler plans to concentrate on local talent and live music
instead of the techno DJs he sees at other local bars. ``At this
rate, we may be the only one's with live music,'' said Butler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really prided ourselves on our cigars,'' said Butler.
``I'm not sorry to see the trend go. You have to evolve or get
crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigar vendors are now left to count on the loyalty of long-term
smokers to carry them through the smoke-free trend. ``My customers
are not trendy people. They are lifelong smokers,'' Guluzian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The craze is over,'' said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar
Association of America.

Part of the public's frustration with public education stems from
the lack of good, hard data on what works best in the classroom.
oo much of what passes for research in education is nothing more
than ``hunches, anecdotes, and impressions,'' according to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A significant exception is Tennessee's Project Star, a
controlled experiment that began in the mid-1980s and involved
almost 12,000 students in kindergarten through Grade 3 who were
placed either in small classrooms (13 to 17 students) or regular
ones (22 to 25 students). Researchers tracked student achievement
for the study groups through high school and beyond. They found
that the students educated in small classrooms scored significantly
better on both standardized and classroom tests in all subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The value of that early experience could be seen years after
students rejoined larger classrooms. By eighth grade, the students
from the smaller classes exceeded the reading levels of other
students by over a year. By graduation, 45 percent of the students
from the smaller classes received honors diplomas, as opposed to 29
percent of students from bigger classes.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers unions should prepare their members to accept that the
effective first-, second-, and third-grade teachers of tomorrow may
be teaching just 13 students while colleagues in higher grades may
need to teach twice that number. The Tennessee study shows that
students up to third grade need at least three years in small
classrooms in order to benefit academically in later years. Many
educators believe small class size is not so crucial in higher
grades, but the data are in dispute. &UR;  &LR; A study comparable in quality
to Project Star would be desirable.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic finding in the report is that reductions in
class size can boost the scores of black and Hispanic students. The
College Board, which oversees the Scholastic Aptitude Test, offers
the latest research on the achievement gap between white and
minority students. The gap usually appears in first grade and
widens considerably by third grade. After that, high achievement is
unlikely, as evidenced by reading and math tests in which only 10
percent of those scoring at the highest level &UR;  &LR; are non-Asian
minorities even though they comprise 30 percent of the test takers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee study found that black and Hispanic students from
small classrooms up to Grade 3 closed the black-white testing gap
by 54 percent. &UR;  &LR; Teachers attribute that advance in part to more
opportunities to work individually with students and less time
spent on discipline.
</P>
<P>
   So much research in education clouds the issues. The Tennessee
class size study begins to illumine this overcast field.

ANOTHER SMALL COMPANY, SYCAMORE NETWORKS, SET TO MAKE WAVES WITH
IPO  
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Cisco Systems Inc. agreed to acquire Cerent Corp. in August
for almost $7 billion, many everyday investors had a common
reaction: who's Cerent?
</P>
<P>
   They may well have a similar feeling on Friday because another
small company, little known beyond Wall Street and the tight-knit
communications fraternity, Sycamore Networks Inc., appears set to
make a big financial wave, only this time investors will at least
have a chance to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore is set to raise more than $280 million in an initial
public offering on Friday. On Thursday night, the issue was priced
at $38 a share, which would give the company a market value of
about $3 billion. It is quite possible, however, that by the end of
Friday Sycamore's value will surpass even the price paid for
Cerent.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation surrounding Sycamore's offering has been mounting
on Wall Street for weeks because the company is perhaps the leading
member of a new breed of companies, including Cerent, that are
developing the next generation of optical networking technology. It
is also the first to offer stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in demand for data communications generally and
for Internet services specifically has required old-line
communications carriers to retool and expand their networks and has
prompted new carriers to design their networks for data from the
ground up.
</P>
<P>
   After the development of suitable optical fibers in the 1970s
initially by Corning Inc., fiber-optic transmission systems were
deployed by the major long-distance carriers in the 1980s to
replace older systems using copper wires largely as a way to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   As companies like Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada and Fujitsu of
Japan developed ways to transmit more and more pulses per second,
Ciena Corp., which went public in 1997, helped lead perhaps the
biggest qualitative leap in optical technology in two decades:
transmitting multiple wavelengths, or colors, of light
simultaneously over a single fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the dominant optical communications technology is known
as Sonet, for synchronous optical network, and while today's latest
Sonet networks are able to transmit billions of bits of digital
information a second, they are inflexible in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   While optical technology has been used widely to transmit large
amounts of data from one point to another, the network intelligence
that determines what goes where and that creates services that
people actually use has remained stubbornly in the domain of
semiconductors and copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all coincidentally, the new breed of optical
communications companies has come along to help change that just as
the big communications carriers realize that the data explosion
requires them to revamp their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a connection between what investors read about
the Internet and the growth and opportunity for these optical
companies,'' said Mary Henry, a communications equipment analyst
for Goldman, Sachs. ``It's really the explosion of data traffic
driven by the Internet that requires this migration to optical
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers now think about network bottlenecks in terms of
what is often called ``the last mile,'' referring to the slow data
links to most U.S. homes. But as more consumers get high-speed
access to cyberspace through cable modems, the high-speed phone
line connections known as digital subscriber lines, or perhaps
wireless links, that will place additional demands on core
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stone wall is an access problem today, like you and I not
being able to get access at the speeds you want,'' said Frank
Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects, a
networking analysis and consulting firm in Washington. ``When we
get it from DSL or cable modems, it pushes the stone wall back into
the network. If you can't make the developments to handle that,
you're left with the same problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those developments are new ways to add and remove traffic
from traditional Sonet fiber-optic systems more efficiently,
technologies that could allow future networks to be designed in
ways that are more flexible than the somewhat rigid ring
configurations required by Sonet and, eventually, communications
switches that operate totally optically.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of companies trying to develop these technologies is
well known to venture capitalists and to the bigger communications
companies like Lucent, Nortel, Cisco and Ciena that have been
acquiring their peers, but to few people outside the industry. In
addition to Sycamore, based in Chelmsford, Mass., it includes
Astral Point, Chromatis, Corvis, Optical Networks Inc., Qtera and
Tellium.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``At the basic technology level, the challenge is: can you get
the basic product done, in a quick time to market and hit your
price point?'' said Richard W. Barcus, Tellium's president. ``The
second layer of accomplishment is: can you establish relationships
with the customers, the service providers, and can you articulate
the value of your products to help them solve their problems?''
</P>
<P>
   In articulating its value to customers and investors, Sycamore's
hurdle has been made much lower by the pedigree of its top
executives, Desh Deshpande and Daniel E. Smith. Deshpande and Smith
were the top two executives at the Cascade Communications Corp.
before that company was acquired by Ascend Communications Inc. in
1997 for $3.7 billion. Cascade's products proved critical to Ascend
and were perhaps the main reason Ascend was subsequently acquired
by Lucent for $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``quiet-period'' regulations related to its stock
offering, Sycamore declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to complete its initial product line by
releasing a fully optical switch in the first half of next year and
appears close to announcing an agreement with Siemens of Germany
under which Siemens will help distribute Sycamore's products
internationally, according to executives close to the companies.
The companies two customers so far are Williams Communications
Group Inc. and Millennium Optical Networks Inc., a competitive
local communications company based in New York.

   That Smell of Success &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some would-be entrepreneurs, watching the current Microsoft
commercials featuring the Great Harvest Bread Co. proved to be as
enticing as, well, walking past a bakery.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising shows homespun, behind-the-scenes footage of
Great Harvest bakery operations, noting that franchises use
Microsoft software to share knowledge and to communicate among
themselves. Since Microsoft started the spots a few months ago,
Great Harvest has seen inquiries seeking information about
franchises increase fivefold on its Web site, said Tom McMakin,
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Great Harvest, founded in 1976 and based in Dillon, Mont., has
relied on word-of-mouth advertising, both for customers and
potential franchisees. It now has 168 bakeries that generate total
annual revenue of $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sudden fame has pitfalls, warned Dr. Ray Smilor, vice
president of the Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, a
nonprofit group in Kansas City, Mo. ``The downside is that for a
small and emerging company,'' Smilor said, ``the possibility of
overdemand can be a tidal wave that can sink their endeavor to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Harvest, for one, isn't letting the glory go to its head.
The company maintains a strict policy that limits franchise growth
to 15 percent to 25 percent annually. Last year, it had 7,000
franchise inquiries, but opened only 15 bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   For the applicants, McMakin observed, the Microsoft ads may make
those franchises ``a touch harder to get.'' &QL;

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After 388 games as a football coach's wife
and countless more games as a sports mom, Ann Bowden should know
how to handle a momentous event. But having your husband coaching
against one of your sons in a game of historical significance isn't
covered in the Mother's Manual.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State at Clemson on tomorrow's schedule is more than
just another football game. For the Bowden Bunch, it's part family
reunion, part family feud. Papa Bobby Bowden coaches the
top-ranked, 7-0 Seminoles; son Tommy Bowden is in his first year as
the coach of the 3-3 Tigers. For Mama Bowden, the game is a
division of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always pulled for my sons, and I get more nervous about
their games,'' Ann Bowden said. ``I don't think this is all going
to hit me until I walk into the stadium. It's going to be hard.
There's a lot at stake for us. We've got a shot at the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very unusual situation.''
</P>
<P>
   College football's family feuds have been limited, in 13 games,
to brother vs. brother. But never has a father coached against his
son at the I-A level. And, adding to the drama, a victory would
give the 69-year-old Bobby Bowden No. 300 for his career, a
milestone reached by just four other Division I-A coaches _ Paul
``Bear'' Bryant (323), Pop Warner (319), Amos Alonzo Stagg (314)
and Joe Paterno (314).
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bowden, a former Auburn coach, will add a historical
footnote. As studio commentator for ABC Sports' college football
coverage, he'll be the first brother to comment on a game between
his father and brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be fun,'' said Terry, who because of his television
work will be the only one of Bobby and Ann's children not in
attendance. ``This family has always thought of college football as
being very special. Whatever happens is a win-win situation for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Bobby and Ann Bowden will watch grandson, Ryan _
Tommy's boy _ play a high school football game. Tomorrow, Ann will
get her first look at the house being built by Tommy and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's as excited as she can be because of all the family
that's going to be together,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``She's
sacrificed a lot during our marriage; she's a football wife. I
think this game will be one of the highlights of her life. She
wants Florida State to win, but she'll want Tommy's team to do
well. She'd be happy if \RFlorida State\S won by a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Bowden said most of his family will be rooting for his
dad's team. Especially mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows how much dad's bonus is if he wins the national
championship,'' Tommy, 45, said. ``That's shopping money, Christmas
money.'' \Nsubheds:Family affair
</P>
<P>
   Bumper stickers have been printed that read, ``This Ain't No
Family Picnic.'' A sellout of 85,000-plus is expected for the game
(6 p.m., ESPN). And it just seems as though 84,000 of them are
somehow connected to the Bowden clan or Florida State. Clemson
assistants Rick Stockstill, Reggie Herring, Brad Scott and Jack
Hines all played and//or coached under Bobby Bowden at Florida
State. Bobby's youngest son, Jeff, is the Seminoles' receivers
coach. Hines, Clemson's secondary coach, is married to Robyn, the
Bowden's eldest child.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bowden family, the football doesn't fall far from the
tree. Ginger, the youngest of the Bowdens, works in the Florida
attorney general's office. Her football connection? She married
John Madden, a former Florida State player.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby and Ann grew up a few blocks from each other in
Birmingham, Ala. Bobby quarterbacked the high school football team.
Ann was a cheerleader _ a true relationship cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up thinking I wanted to be a cheerleader and marry a
football player,'' Robyn said. ``That's how it impacted me. I don't
remember it being a big deal having our dad be the football coach.
But football was just always something that was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden's head coaching career started at Samford
University in Birmingham in 1959. Robyn remembers going to games
dressed in cheerleader outfits. Terry and his brothers remember
road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team traveled in buses and we would crawl up in the
luggage racks above the seats and go to sleep,'' Terry said. ``And
those players, we really looked up to them, they were big ol' guys
who made us laugh. We thought of 'em as old men and of course, they
were all just 19, 20 years old. We lived in a dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like a 1950s TV sitcom. Father knew football best and
worked to build a successful career. Mother took care of the home
as a full-time mom and part-time dad.
</P>
<P>
   Steve, a private businessman who manages his parents' money, was
the sensitive, deep thinking older brother. Tommy, though a
prankster, was cautious, looking before he leaped. Terry was an
overachieving Type A all the way, leaping before he looked. Jeff
was the picked-on youngest brother. If there was a discipline issue
involving all four brothers, Terry often would take the blame. ``He
just wanted to get it over with to get on to something else,''
Robyn said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was football 24-7-365.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go out to eat and dad would be drawing plays on
napkins,'' Terry said. ``And us boys, we'd be sitting there doing
the same thing, doodling formations. Everybody in this family can
draw perfect x's and o's and little squares and dotted lines and
arrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Following in father's coaching footsteps wasn't encouraged, but
considering Bobby Bowden's success, it's not surprising. In 34
years as a head coach, Bowden has had two losing seasons _ 4-7 at
West Virginia in 1974 and 5-6 at Florida State in 1976, his first
season with the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   In sixth grade, Tommy wrote a term paper in which he said he
wanted to be a football coach when he grew up. In 1998, in his
second season at Tulane, Tommy Bowden's team finished 12-0. In
1993, his first season at Auburn, Terry Bowden's team finished
11-0. That same season, Florida State finished 11-1 and won the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very insecure, stressful profession, we grew up with a
father who was very successful in his job,'' said Terry, who
remembers at age 14 making speeches talking about becoming a
football coach. ``That's really all we've been exposed to.''
\Nsubheds:Support group
</P>
<P>
   The bond of family and football led to an unofficial family
reunion last Thanksgiving. The clan gathered at Terry's house in
Auburn, Ala. A month earlier, after his Tigers had started 1-5, he
resigned because he believed he would be fired at season's end.
During the holiday gathering, little was said in actual support of
the overachieving Bowden son, but the family's presence spoke
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between a minor setback and a major
tragedy. For Terry, that was a minor setback,'' Ann said. ``That
was a real defeat for him, and he's never really lost at anything
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the coaching business, the family ties are what gets you
through the hard times. You know they love you and support you
regardless of wins and losses. I feel sorry for coaches that don't
have that kind of support system.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, contracts were signed scheduling Auburn against
Florida State in this season's opener. Terry's resignation canceled
the father-son matchup (and the game was never played; Auburn paid
$500,000 to back out).
</P>
<P>
   But in December, Tommy was hired by Clemson, like Florida State
a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Oct. 23 became the
calendar target and a quick check of the math showed that a 7-0
Seminoles start would have Bobby Bowden going for his 300th victory
against his son's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this game has the magnitude of the Florida or Miami
games. There is a special feeling this week,'' Bobby said. ``It's
amazing how this has all come together, how it matches up that I'm
playing Tommy's team with the chance to win 300 games. I never
could have imagined it like this.''

 &HT;    Recruitment remains a problem for Border Patrol
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional budget negotiators want to hire an
additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents next year _ a plan consistent
with a sweeping 1996 immigration law _ but they are fraught with
ongoing recruitment challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which must win President Clinton's
approval, an additional $48.5 million would pay for 1,000 new
border patrol agents in fiscal year 2000. Agents hired after Jan. 1
would get recruitment bonuses. If the Immigration and
Naturalization Service is unable to hire 1,000 agents by June 1,
some of the money could go to pay raises for career officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol has grown from 5,878 agents in 1996 to 8,351
this year. But a healthy economy and the lure of better-paying law
enforcement jobs has not made it easy for INS officials to comply
with a 1996 law requiring them to hire 1,000 agents a year for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred agents must still be found to meet the 1999 quota.
That sends INS critics into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fiscal year 1999, they hired 400 new additional agents.
Congress gave them money for 1,000,'' said Allen Kay, spokesman for
Congressman Lamar Smith, a San Antonio Republican and fierce INS
critic. ``If border security was a priority for the Clinton
administration, it would have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), who helped craft the
agreement, wants the Justice Department to update Congress on the
status of a lawsuit challenging Operation Rio Grande, a deterrence
effort that involves setting up two-dozen large lights along the
Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Nicole Chulick said Thursday that the agency is
still reviewing the agreement. She said 52,825 Border Patrol
applicants passed an initial screening this year, up from 42,000 in
1998. Attrition remains at about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a really good economy and multiple job
choices for potential applicants,'' she said. ``The military has
not met their hiring goals, either, so it's been a problem across
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is now training Border Patrol agents to help search
out new recruits. Chulick said 200 agents completed a two-week
recruitment training course in July.
</P>
<P>
   Other immigration issues, such as raising the cap on H1B visas
for high-tech workers, could remain on the back burner. Smith, who
chairs a House subcommittee on immigration, still wants to adopt
plans to restructure the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are at the end of the budget year and things are
busy,'' Kay said. ``But that's still his intent and if there's any
way to do that, he will.''

MANY BANKS MAKE MONEY ON LENDING IN POOR AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C.)  (dal) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making home loans to poor people may not be as profitable as
lending to everyone else, but it is not bad business, either.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the experience of many banks under the Community
Reinvestment Act. The 22-year-old federal law, which encourages
banks to make loans in low- and middle-income neighborhoods, proved
to be the most contentious battleground in the fight that appears
likely to end _ yet again _ in a stalemate over how to overhaul the
nation's banking laws.
</P>
<P>
   Critics led by Phil Gramm of Texas, the chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, want to strip the law of some of its teeth,
arguing that it imposes unfair regulatory burdens on banks and
allows community activists to ``extort'' money from institutions
that do not want bad publicity over their lending records.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders including the Clinton administration _ which has
made clear it intends to veto the bill that Gramm wants _ say the
rules are necessary to insure that bank redlining in poor
neighborhoods does not recur and to serve as a reasonable
counterweight to industry consolidation over the last 20 years that
has left many low-income areas with few, if any, bank branches.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who says a bank cannot still make good money? A Federal
Reserve Board study concluded two years ago there is ``no
compelling evidence of lower profitability at commercial banks that
specialize in home purchase lending in lower-income neighborhoods
or to lower-income borrowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bank of America, which estimates that its community
lending and investment business will post a 20 percent return on
equity this year. Such a result is not as good as the entire bank's
28 percent return for the first half of the year, perhaps, but it
is not too shabby, either. Created when Nationsbank acquired
BankAmerica last year, the bank _ based in Charlotte, N.C., and now
the nation's second-largest, after Citigroup _ pledged a 10-year,
$350-billion package of community-development lending and
investment to assuage regulators and activists worried about the
merger's effect on low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns are better than many lines of business that we
have,'' said Catherine Bessant, president of community-development
lending at the bank, which, like many other large institutions,
supports the Community Reinvestment Act. ``It's a functioning
business unit. We do it for business reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   After Congress passed the law in 1977, many banks ignored it
until the early 1990s, when regulators and the Clinton
administration stepped up examinations while community advocates
intensified protests of mergers involving banks with spotty
records. The law requires banks' lending records to be reviewed
periodically to insure that they meet the credit needs of the
communities they serve, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods.
Poor compliance can hurt efforts to expand or acquire other banks,
though such setbacks rarely happen.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, figures supplied by both community groups and
banking industry officials suggest that the law has been effective
over the last decade. Today, 29 percent of home mortgage loans are
made to low-income borrowers, compared with 18 percent nine years
ago, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a
nonprofit group in Washington made up of 700 community lending
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Some places have experienced far greater changes. In Texas, for
instance, the proportion of Nationsbank's home loans to low-income
borrowers leaped from 1 percent in 1989 to more than 20 percent
over the last decade, Ms. Bessant said.
</P>
<P>
   And lenders have promised more than $1 trillion to future
community lending and investment in low-income areas. Nearly all of
that has been pledged in the last few years, after regulators
changed the compliance rules to focus more on actual dollar
amounts, while community groups sought assurances that a spate of
recent industry mega-mergers would not hurt loan volumes in poorer
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   That is a huge sum. But just as auto makers fought regulations
forcing them to install airbags, only to find later that consumers
wanted the added safety measures and were willing to pay for them,
many banks' community-lending and investment pledges have proven to
be as profitable as other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the community reinvestment law play down its
significance by arguing that banks would have lent or invested much
of the pledged money anyway.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has a more specific objection to the law, which, in his
view, amounts to a shakedown: He contends that banks that want to
merge or expand have to deal with opportunistic community activists
who agree to silence their outrage over lending records only after
being paid off with grants, consulting fees or other payments. He
has sought to require disclosure of details of most of these
payments and agreements.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, his committee circulated copies of what he said
were secret agreements in which community activists promise to end
protests over lending practices in exchange for money for their
organizations. In one such document, in which the names were
blacked out, a protester agreed not to object to any bank expansion
in return for payments including $7.5 million in grants over 10
years and $200,000 for new offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one living in any of these communities served by CRA has
any idea what was promised on their behalf,'' said Christi Harlan,
Gramm's committee spokeswoman. ``They don't know how much these
so-called community groups are getting and spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups see darker motives. ``Gramm is trying to both
discourage banks from entering into those agreements and hinder the
efforts of community groups who have limited resources,'' said
Chris Saffert, a legislative representative for the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now, the community-lending group
better known as Acorn. ``It's part of a larger attack on CRA. He's
tried to create scandals, but when you find the real details of a
situation, there's nothing scandalous there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm also wants to lessen the number of community-reinvestment
exams faced by small institutions, while community groups want more
hearings for bank mergers involving assets over $1 billion and to
give regulators more power to punish banks whose ratings under the
community-reinvestment law fall after mergers and banks that do not
live up to their community-lending pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposals have support among some in the industry,
especially in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have witnessed in Texas what has happened in many
Northeastern states, where community groups will protest a merger
or acquisition, despite the fact the banks have outstanding or
satisfactory CRA ratings,'' said John Heasley, executive vice
president of the Texas Bankers Association, which favors the Gramm
proposals. ``At that point, federal regulators usually sit on their
hands, and banks will work out a deal with the community groups,
and more often than not, money changes hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups argue that the law needs strengthening. Only 1
out of every 50 banks received less-than-satisfactory ratings under
the law last year _ compared with 1 of every 10 in 1992 _ according
to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. That has prompted
worries that federal regulators are not as tough as they used to be
and fail banks only in extraordinary cases, said Joshua Silver, the
group's vice president for research and policy.
</P>
<P>
   But despite concerns about shortcomings in the law, community
advocacy groups hail it as a big success, attributing most of the
improved lending in poor areas to its enforcement. ``There may have
been an increase without CRA,'' Silver said, ``but we don't think
much of an increase.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Good early-childhood education has a powerful
influence that lasts into young adulthood, affecting everything
from reading and mathematics skills to the timing of childbearing,
researchers announced on Thursday, citing the first study ever to
track participants from infancy to age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Those who received high-quality day care consistently
outperformed their peers who did not on both cognitive and academic
tests, and also were more likely to attend college or hold
high-skill jobs, the researchers found. The program also helped
participants' parents, with teen-age mothers far more likely to
have completed high school after their babies received the
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called efficacy question, whether you can affect
development in the preschool years, is resoundingly answered in the
affirmative,'' Craig T. Ramey, director of the landmark study, said
at a news conference at the Department of Education. ``It has
become crystal clear that if you wait until age 3 or 4 you are
going to be dealing with a series of delays and deficits that will
put you in remedial programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, called the Abecedarian Project, involved 111 poor
African-American families in Chapel Hill, N.C., whose infants were
medically healthy but, demographically, at risk for failure in
school and beyond. Half the children were randomly assigned to
full-time day-care from infancy to age 5, while the others received
only nutritional supplements and some social work. They attended
comparable public schools from kindergarten on.
</P>
<P>
   With low adult-child ratios and a stable, professional staff,
the educational program consisted of a series of 200 simple games
focused on language development, starting with visual stimulus for
tiny infants and leading to scavenger hunts and mazes for older
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the study, pediatricians and psychologists issued a
new call for universal early-childhood education programs, urging
Congress and the states to broaden access to care for poor
families, particularly those on welfare, and to improve conditions
and curriculum in the current cadre of day-care centers. The
announcement comes amid increased attention to the issue, with a
group of experts scheduled to meet here next week to applaud
France's universal preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most child care in America is borderline lousy and, at best,
safe but not developmentally stimulating,'' said Michael H. Levine,
who oversees early childhood development projects for Carnegie
Corp. in New York. ``Whether or not there's a government solution
to providing high-quality care for all working families or not,
there certainly needs to be a more balanced responsibility for
responding to this research.''
</P>
<P>
   Abecedarian _ the word, echoing the ABCs, means novice learner _
found that children in the intensive educational program were more
successful than their peers by virtually every measure:
</P>
<P>
   _ 35 percent of those in the day-care program attended a
four-year college before their 21st birthday, compared with 14
percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
   _ At age 21, twice as many of the day-care graduates _ 40
percent _ were still in school; 65 percent of those who received
the intervention either had a good job or were in college, compared
with 40 percent of the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer of the participants in the child-care program had
children of their own by age 21; those who did became parents, on
average, past their 19th birthday, while the parents in the other
group were about 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ By age 15, twice as many of the children in the control group
had been placed in special education classes as their peers who
received the educational day care. Only 30 percent of the day-care
children had to repeat a grade in school, compared with 56 percent
of the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ While test scores were below average for both groups and
dropped over time, those in the child-care program kept an edge of
about 5 percentage points through age 21. The gap in IQ, however,
fell from about 17 points at age 3 to just 5 points by age 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ The study did not find significant differences in criminal
activity between the two groups, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most intensely studied group of children on
earth,'' Ramey said, noting that researchers collected about 10,000
pieces of data about each child each year _ everything from viruses
and bacteria in their respiratory systems to their participation in
organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey, now a professor of psychology, pediatrics and
neurobiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and his
colleagues at the University of North Carolina, have already
published nearly 300 academic papers based on the Abecedarian
Project, and plan additional journal articles in the coming months
based on the new data. They also hope to continue tracking the
participants to age 28 or 29. The research has been funded by the
Department of Education and the state of North Carolina, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The Abecedarian results echo results of several similar studies
that indicate educational day care improves academic achievement
and social behaviors. It is the first program that began with
infants _ aged 6 weeks to 4 months _ and followed them to
adulthood, and shows more significant gaps at age 21 than a similar
project, based in Michigan, that began with developmentally
disadvantaged children aged 3 or 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important is that it's not just any child care,
that it is high-quality early care and intervention,'' said Augusta
S. Kappner, president of Bank Street College of Education in New
York, who recently toured France with a group of 15 educators to
study that country's program of universal free preschool. ``What is
high quality? Usually you're talking about the really important
factors, such as the qualifications of the staff, the constancy of
the staff, the quality of the curriculum, group size, parent
participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abecedarian Project, based at the Frank Porter Graham Child
Development Center in Chapel Hill, had staff with qualifications
akin to public-school teachers, and virtually no turnover. Ratios
ranged from 1 to 3 to 1 to 7 depending on the children's ages.
</P>
<P>
   The learning games, such as waving a scarf over an infant until
he grabs it, or leading a toddler to identify like items among
several pieces of silverware, are integrated into a high-stimulus
day of art projects and playground visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the learning games happen during mealtimes, they
happen during diapering, they happen when you're going outdoors,''
explained Joseph Sparling, co-author of the curriculum, which was
published in two books. ``You could hardly distinguish them from
good adult-child interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Abecedarian cost the equivalent of $11,000 per child per year in
today's dollars, but researchers said similar results could likely
be accomplished for less, since there were extra expenses
associated with being a demonstration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that we can't afford this is absolutely bogus _
we get what we pay for,'' Ramey said. ``We're the richest country
on the face of the earth, we're the richest we've ever been. We're
not No. 1 in the world in education, in health care, in social
services.''  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, the International Labor Organization has been
derided as an ineffectual, anticapitalistic talking shop, when it
has been noticed at all. But its new director-general, Juan
Somavia, is intent on changing all that.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,300 employees and a $480 million budget, the Geneva-based
organization, an agency of the United Nations, has broad
responsibilities, among them leading the worldwide fight against
abuse of child labor, promoting job creation in poor countries and
defending workers' rights to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   Somavia arrived in March believing that the organization need
not be anti-business to achieve its objectives.
</P>
<P>
   With his thick beard, Somavia, 58, a Chilean diplomat, looks
like an Amish farmer, but he talks like a pragmatic politician and
social theorist. He served as Chile's representative to the United
Nations and was chief organizer of the 1995 World Summit for Social
Development in Copenhagen before taking his new post.
</P>
<P>
   Somavia took time from attending the AFL-CIO convention in Los
Angeles to discuss his plans. Here are excerpts from the
conversation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why should Americans pay attention to the International Labor
Organization? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The ILO's Philadelphia Declaration from 1944 stated that
poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere. You
can't be indifferent to what's happening in the rest of the world.
The global economy is not distributing its benefits sufficiently to
people _ to workers in America or to workers around the world. If I
had to synthesize what the ILO is trying to do, it is, ``How do we
make markets work for everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   What does the ILO do when it finds that markets are not working?
We have to promote entrepreneurship. Unless you generate more work
in the world, we'll continue to have a series of problems. And to
insure decent work, there's no substitute for organize, organize,
organize. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The ILO has long had a reputation as a lethargic bureaucracy.
How will you reinvigorate it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I want to basically do two things: focus and modernize. And I
plan to concentrate on four areas. First is protecting the rights
of people at work. The second is employment and job creation,
access to work. That's what people in the street want.
</P>
<P>
   The third focus is social protection like Social Security,
pensions, safe work. A central reality of the global economy is
that a majority of people don't have basic social protections of
any kind. The fourth focus is dialogue. The ILO is one of the only
places where you have employers, workers and government engaging in
dialogue, talking things out to find common solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy is bringing ILO issues to center stage, and
consequently I arrive at a moment that we have a very good mandate.
But we have to be much more pointed in how we go about it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Sometimes your goals to create jobs and eliminate poverty
seem to overlap with those at the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund. How do you avoid conflict? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I was very glad to see the IMF and World Bank put the
elimination of poverty on their agenda. Our job is to be a social
pillar, to make sure they're taking care of the social dimension.
Many of the things that were done to make structural adjustment
work meant that an enormous number of companies went broke.
Somebody has to have an eye on what happens to people.
</P>
<P>
   We in the international community have to agree on the issues on
which we should all be pushing in the same direction. I suggest the
reduction of poverty, creating employment (it's the first step out
of poverty) and having more inclusive societies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you respond to critics who say your organization's
agenda is anti-business? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Our historical mandate is to look at life at work. Our
mandate is to promote workers' rights, but that's not the only
thing we're about. We're also about tripartism between employers,
workers and government. We're about dialogue, about creating jobs
and entrepreneurialism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is the new child labor convention so important? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a growing consciousness that we should not have
child labor. Child labor is a complex issue. It's strongly linked
to development and whether parents have a job or whether children
can go to school.
</P>
<P>
   The new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor was
approved in June, and now it has to be ratified by different
countries. It was the first time you had global unanimity on child
labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of tensions on child labor, and some countries
have not ratified existing child labor conventions, but finally we
have been able to put together complete unanimity on the worst
forms of child labor that should be banned _ prostitution,
pornography, hazardous mining, serving as soldiers. The most
important thing is to ban all of the morally abhorrent situations
that no family would like its children to live through.

COUNCIL READY TO APPROVE TRANSFER OF EAST TIMOR TO U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An international administration for East Timor,
backed by 10,000 troops, is widely expected to be approved on
Friday by the U.N. Security Council. That would open the way for a
formal transfer of authority in the territory from Indonesia to the
United Nations, officially ending a quarter-century of Indonesian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   A new national assembly in Jakarta decided by consensus on
Wednesday to relinquish Indonesian claims to the territory, which
it seized after colonial Portugal pulled out in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The only possible delay in the Security Council, diplomats said,
could be from the Chinese, who are objecting to the enabling
resolution's support for an investigation in East Timor by the U.N.
high commissioner for human rights. Diplomats met Thursday night to
discuss how to overcome China's objections before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to name Sergio Vieira
de Mello as administrator for the territory, at least for an
initial period of up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Differences of opinion in persist here about the nationality of
the long-term administrator, known as the special representative of
the secretary general, who may be in the territory for two or three
years and will enjoy sweeping powers.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian, is an undersecretary-general who
coordinates relief and refugee affairs. He also set up the civilian
administration in Kosovo after the NATO bombing, before Bernard
Kouchner of France was appointed chief administrator there.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of a peacekeeping force for East Timor and
another for Sierra Leone on the same day, the Security Council will
be putting the United Nations back in the active business of
peacekeeping in a big way _ in effect doubling the numbers of
troops in the field in one day's votes. A sizeable force for the
Congo looms in future planning.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was asked Thursday how the United Nations, short of cash
and other resources, would be able to handle several large new
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the pendulum has swung, and I think all of us who
have been in this building were aware that when it comes to
peacekeeping and crisis management, you go through peaks and
troughs,'' Annan said. ``Now it is on the upswing. But we are not
looking for business. But once a crisis has broken out and we have
been given the mandate, we have to be given the resources to make
it viable. I encourage all the member states to bear that very much
in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk of resources, I talk of resources being given to
us promptly, because it is the early stages which can make or break
a mission,'' the secretary-general said. The United Nations is
still far behind in raising the money needed for the reconstruction
of civilian life and institutions in Kosovo, where tensions between
ethnic Albanians and Serbs still run high.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Miyet, the head of the U.N. peacekeeping department,
said recently that the reconstruction of East Timor, though smaller
and with far fewer people, could be even more difficult and costly
than the operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor will literally have to be rebuilt after armed
militias opposed to independence destroyed most of its towns. The
United Nations will have to introduce services from sanitation to
new education and judicial systems, and without a trained corps of
local civil servants to draw on. Other fundamental issues like a
choice of language and legal code will have to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's acknowledged political leader, Jose Alexandre
Gusmao _ who is considered likely to be the new country's first
president or prime minister _may return to the territory as early
as this weekend, according to reports from Australia. In an
interview here last month after his release from imprisonment and
later house arrest in Jakarta, Gusmao said that he and his council
expected to be involved in making these critical decisions about
East Timor's future.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ Buried inside the news pages of The Palm Beach
Post from Dec. 18, 1990, are 180 words. They tell of a 13-year-old
boy, Ronald Jean, barely 5 feet and 100 pounds, who was abandoned
by his mother at a Greyhound bus station three months earlier
because he refused to accompany her and his 3-year-old sister on a
trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The search remained unsuccessful. Jean was never officially
adopted. Nor has he found his mother, Charlene Bumere, or younger
sister, Tatiana.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly nine years later, the 5-foot-5-inch, 187-pound Jean
has found a home in the mountains of Eastern Pennsylvania at Lehigh
University. He has found a family, too. Actually, two families: one
in Ohio and one in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And as a senior running back, he has grown into a professional
football prospect _ albeit a long shot _ whose strength and
determination cannot only be measured by dumbbells and stop
watches.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is more impressive about Jean? His 435-pound bench
press? His 40-yard dash time of 4.38 seconds? His 766 rushing yards
and 15 touchdowns for the 6-0 Mountain Hawks? Or that a child whose
mother abused and abandoned him, who was shuttled through foster
homes, will graduate in May from Lehigh with a degree in
psychology?
</P>
<P>
   ``The scouts know who Ronald is; they are impressed,'' said
Chris Demarest, a former Lehigh assistant who is now at Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had every excuse not to succeed, but he has never given
up,'' Demarest said. ``No matter what happens to him in football,
he already is the biggest success I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 180 words inside that newspaper never mentioned the scars
on Jean's body _ a long knife slash across his stomach among them _
from his mother's abuse. Nor could they foretell the series of
roadblocks on an improbable journey through football to college.
</P>
<P>
   Jean pulls his shirt above his 28-inch waist to reveal the
Zorro-like knife scar that marks his stomach. It is the reason he
made his first tough decision _ the one that still haunts him. He
said his mother beat him with extension cords. He said she drank
and smoked marijuana, perhaps even crack cocaine. But he said
things got worse when they arrived in South Florida from the
Bahamas in the summer of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   They were only there a couple of weeks when the knifing
occurred. So on Sept. 5, 1990, when Charlene Bumere took her
children to the bus station in West Palm Beach, Jean had made up
his mind. She wanted to get on a bus for New York. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had pushed me over my limit,'' Jean said matter-of-factly
in a soft lilting voice. ``I told her I wasn't going. She got on
the bus with my sister and left me crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper report nine years ago said the young boy appeared
to be from the Islands, perhaps Haiti, but no one in the local
communities knew anything of him. And authorities in New York could
not locate his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Jean was placed in a shelter and then into a foster home in
Pahokee near the Everglades. And then into another foster home.
Just as no one from his past would show up, it took a while for
someone in his future to step forward. He was small, shy and,
during junior high school, combative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought with other kids in the foster homes,'' he said. ``At
school, kids would tease me that nobody wanted me, and I'd fight
there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of his stays in a foster home, however, he discovered
sports when he befriended an older boy, Nathaniel Mosely, who was a
running back at Pahokee High School. Jean ran with him, lifted
weights and was introduced to football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I could do for myself, away from the people
who were smoking and drinking and getting in trouble,'' Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   In junior high, he learned how much he loved the game when he
was ruled ineligible for poor grades. Never again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided then I would do what it takes, study as long as I
needed, to play,'' said Jean, whose Lehigh team hopes to improve on
its unbeaten mark Saturday against Holy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his freshman year in high school, Jean moved to a
foster home in Boca Raton. There, he got the attention of Jay
Minton, then the Boca Raton High School football coach, and his
wife, Susie. Jean, all 135 pounds of him, approached Minton as a
freshman and said he wanted to play on the varsity team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little old thing, said Minton, now the coach at Wayne
High School in Huber Heights, Ohio. ``It made me smile. But he did
make the junior varsity that year, and you could tell he knew how
to get what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jean, the coach saw a raw talent who had hit the weight room
to become a better football player and the books, too. Minton's
wife, on the other hand, saw a sweet, quiet kid desperate for a
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is really good at smiling you and getting his way,'' Susie
Minton said.
</P>
<P>
   By his senior year, Jean was living with the Mintons and their
two daughters. He gained more than 1,000 yards on an 11-2 team that
sent Khori Ivy to start at wide receiver for West Virginia and
Steve Bellisari to quarterback for Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Demarest, then a Lehigh assistant, was looking at film of those
big timers when he kept noticing the tiny running back _ then 165
pounds _ skittering all over the field. He asked to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew immediately there was something in his eyes I liked,''
Demarest said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh does not offer scholarships, but Jean was seduced by the
one-time steel town carved from the Pennsylvania mountains. Or at
least he thought he was on his visit. But three days after arriving
as a freshman, his bags were packed and he was ready to go home.
But where was that? The Mintons had moved to Ohio. In their place,
Walter and Mercedes Anderson stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   Jean had befriended their daughter Melissa and son David, and
had become a frequent and welcome guest in their home. He liked the
noise and action at the Andersons; they liked his gentle presence.
</P>
<P>
   When he called to say he wanted to come home, Mercedes Anderson
said she told him the same thing she would tell her own kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called here in tears,'' she recalled. ``He was lonely. I
told him if he left, he'd never step foot in this house again. I
didn't mean it, but I wanted him to understand this wasn't a
challenge but the best opportunity he had ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh Coach Kevin Higgins, too, was shaken and moved by his
freshman's fears. He called him to the office and made him a
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you've had an uphill battle the whole way,'' he told
him. ``But here at Lehigh no one was going to put you on an island,
academically, socially or athletically.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean stayed, sitting out his freshman year to focus on his
studies. He played sparingly as a sophomore behind Rabih Abdullah,
now a running back with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jean scored 14 touchdowns after taking the starting
position over in midseason. Returning to Florida for the summer, he
worked out alongside Chris Carter and Randy Moss of the Minnesota
Vikings, and a host of other National Football League players.
</P>
<P>
   Jean is a long shot for the NFL, but no one who knows him doubts
that he will make it.. Mercedes Anderson calls him a gift. Chris
Demarest says he is a survivor who can overcome any odds. And Susie
Minton credits him with teaching her how to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   He calls all of them his family, and phones each of them every
week. If not the NFL, Jean said he will go to graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a couple things left that Jean wants to do. He
wants to hug the sister he barely remembers. And he wants to find
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell her I forgive her,'' he said. ``I want her to
know how my life has turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   That story will take much more than 180 words.

 &HT;    40 charged in fraud ring run out of recording studio
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They lured rap artist wannabes and strippers with a
posh recording studio, luxury cars and wads of cash. They used
sophisticated computer equipment to make false checks and driver's
licenses. They stole $2.5 million worth of checks that they used to
counterfeit for millions of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors Thursday described the check counterfeiting
ring, operated out of a College Park, Ga., recording studio, as one
of the largest in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Forty people have been charged with defrauding banks and other
victims out of an estimated $8 million. Thirty were being sentenced
in federal court this week on convictions of mail fraud,
counterfeiting, bank fraud, theft and conspiracy. Two suspects _
Tony Underwood and Michelle Jackson _ remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   One ringleader, Joseph Jones, a 31-year-old man from Oxford,
received the harshest sentence: five years in federal prison and an
order to pay $522,651 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes, who is presiding
over the case, complained about an unsettling development: A
``rash'' of defendants became pregnant after pleading guilty and
are now asking for leniency. But the judge declined to reduce their
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   According to an indictment, Jones moved to Georgia from Texas in
1995. He started the scheme almost right away; it ended last
February, court documents said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones worked out of Infinity Sound Labs in College Park and,
with others, recruited bank employees to steal personal and
corporate checks that had been mailed to banks, prosecutors said.
More than $2.5 million in checks were taken from Mellon Bank and GE
Capital mail lockboxes in the Atlanta area, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen checks caused problems for many people, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Gale McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disrupted real people terribly,'' she said. ``Some people
whose checks were stolen had their electricity turned off. Some
businesses had their operations interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated computer programs, the ring made counterfeit
checks by using checking account information from stolen checks,
even adding corporate logos. That way, bank tellers could promptly
verify funds in the corporate accounts and cash them for the ring's
check ``passers.''
</P>
<P>
   Strippers at Atlanta area adult entertainment clubs and budding
musicians were recruited to pass the checks. Once they agreed to
join the ring, they were carefully trained.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the runners were told: Look in a
bank teller's eyes to detect suspicion. If the check is not cashed
in two minutes, leave the bank. Wear tennis shoes for running away.
Put super glue on fingers and palms to cover fingerprints. Cash
checks when tellers are busy.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury cars used by the ring had been stolen. Using fake
driver's licenses and IDs, members of the ring who were arrested
were able to skip scheduled court appearances after posting bond.
</P>
<P>
   During a sentencing Thursday morning, Carnes noted that great
trust is placed in bank officials. ``It's frightening we've seen so
many bank employees in this case tamper with bank records and
proceeds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes sentenced one former NationsBank teller, Toi Reid, to 10
months in prison. Over an 11-day period, Reid cashed 91 counterfeit
checks totaling $90,549, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, noticeably pregnant, was among the women who asked for her
sentence to be reduced. She told the judge that she did not get
pregnant to dodge prison time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a rash of pregnancies, you can forgive me for
wondering,'' Carnes said. ``To decide to have a child to shave a
few months off your sentence is a very self-absorbed and reckless
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Carnes did not reduce Reid's prison term, she did allow
her to report to prison in March, weeks after the baby is expected
to be delivered.

GORE PROPOSES BAN ON NEW OFFSHORE DRILLING
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BRADLEY-POVERTY) 
(sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore said on Thursday that as
president he would ban any new offshore drilling for oil and gas
along the California and Florida coasts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last year extended a moratorium on drilling
first imposed by President George Bush. But the proposal by Gore,
who is battling his presidential rival Bill Bradley for the support
of environmental groups, would go beyond that to apply to companies
that have already bought billions of dollars worth of leases but
not drilled yet.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban could be implemented by executive order, but it would
immediately set the stage for major legal challenges to a Gore
administration. There are 36 existing leases off California, 146
off Florida and 19 off North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The ban would not cover drilling along the Gulf Coast, where oil
and gas exploration is central to the economy and more accepted by
government officials and residents, or off the Alaskan coast.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cast his controversial proposal, which he expected to be
``attacked'' for, as part of a bold environmental agenda that he
promised would be the centerpiece of his presidential campaign. The
campaign was preparing to broadcast a new 30-second campaign
commercial on the drilling issue on Thursday night in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to worry about oil washing up on the shores of
Santa Barbara or Monterey or on any coast, east or west, or on the
coast of Florida,'' he said to environmentalists here and via
satellite to a group in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's promise to elevate the environment to a priority is part
of an urgent attempt by his campaign to capture the support of the
nation's major environmental groups, which so far have not endorsed
anyone _ a blow to the vice president since he is a long-time
environmentalist and is perceived as a natural ally of the
environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   By playing hard to get, the groups have forced Gore to make
promises that go beyond his administration's own policies. It is a
tactic that organized labor also used before the AFL-CIO endorsed
him at its annual meeting earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental community has been reluctant to jump on the
Gore train in part because of what it sees as the Clinton
administration's mixed record, complaining that over the years, the
White House has not done enough to fight global warming or restrict
logging on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists also consider Bill Bradley, Gore's sole
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, a staunch ally
who in fact achieved higher ratings in the Senate for his work on
environmental issues than Gore did. And there is concern in the
environmental community, as there is more broadly among Democrats,
that Gore cannot win a general election against Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters, the
nation's top two mainstream politically active environmental
groups, have failed to rally on the vice president's behalf. The
groups' top officials, some of whom privately back Gore, say that
they never have endorsed candidates during the Democratic primary
process.
</P>
<P>
   A third national environmental group that gets involved in
politics, Friends of the Earth, has endorsed Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters,
said, ``We're seeing the major party candidates fighting to capture
our hearts. What more do you want? The environmental community is
not a bloc, and most are standing in the middle waiting to be
wooed.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said that
neither Gore nor Mr. Bradley has articulated a comprehensive vision
for the future. ``The differences in their records doesn't warrant
our making a choice between them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the environment is a central issue with many
voters, especially swing voters in the suburbs and women.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has a lifetime rating from the League of Conservation
Voters of 84 percent, a reflection mainly of his work on
environmental problems in New Jersey, which he represented in the
Senate for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a rating of 64 percent, which reflects several absences
from votes during his career, the large number of toxic Superfund
sites in Tennessee that have not been cleaned up as well as Gore's
father's position on the boards of coal companies that were
involved in strip-mining.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore acknowledged on Thursday that Bradley had a strong
record. ``I haven't challenged his commitment to the environment,''
Gore said. ``I think he has a pretty good voting record on the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the difference was that he was a leader on
various environmental issues, citing his role in passing the law to
clean up Superfund sites and his concern about global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the environmental groups are more skeptical
about his leadership than Gore suggests. ``Many environmentalists
feel Clinton-Gore have been lax in leading on global-climate
issues,'' Ms. Callahan told an audience in New York Tuesday night
that included Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pope said that Bradley's problem was that he had not made clear
how central the environment is to his candidacy. He said Gore's
problem was that ``because he has said so much on the environment
in the past, it will be hard for him to say something bold and
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's other big problem, Pope said, is that ``Bill Clinton has
diminished Gore's environmental reputation over the last seven
years,'' and he needs to re-establish his environmental
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore was more assertive than he has been so far in
his campaign about staking his candidacy on environmental issues,
and noted that he was going farther _ ``significantly farther'' _
than the Clinton administration in banning the use of future
drilling leases.
</P>
<P>
   His statement brought swift reaction from the oil and gas
industries, which promised to keep pushing to drill in new areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long way between now and Al Gore's inauguration,''
said Robert Stewart, president of the National Ocean Industries
Association, a trade group for offshore contractors.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the industry is already embroiled in a dispute over an
existing lease off of Florida owned by Chevron, which has asked
Commerce Secretary William Daley to overturn Florida's objection to
the company's drilling plan. Daley's decision could come early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore mentioned the Florida conflict but did not give his view on
what Daley should do. A spokeswoman said the vice president thought
it would be ``inappropriate to interfere in the existing process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla, said the vice president's position
``sends a loud message to the Commerce Department: reject Chevron's
off-shore drilling application.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Precedent exists for buying back leases given a change in oil
drilling policy. The Clinton administration in 1995 agreed to pay
$200 million to reacquire 73 leases off southwest Florida after
they were deemed to present an environmental risk to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal could have the broadest impact on drilling near
California, where various companies have obtained 40 leases off the
central coast, many off southern San Luis Opispo County.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications of vast deposits of oil under the sea bed,
perhaps up to 1 billion barrels. The rights, valued at about $1.2
billion, were obtained from 1968 to 1984. They have remained
undeveloped so far.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of his proposed ban on such leases, Gore said that
the benefits to all citizens of fishing, tourism and appreciation
of beautiful vistas ``far outweigh'' any monetary benefits to the
oil industry from ``the tiny little bit of extra oil'' that would
come from drilling.

PATS SEEK GAINS ON THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bobby Grier said this week he thought he had
running backs who can do the job, which is why he didn't bid on
Karim Abdul-Jabbar, Napoleon Kaufman, or Barry Sanders before
Tuesday's trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' vice president of player personnel also had two
chances to obtain Jamal Anderson, the Atlanta Falcons star who is
on injured reserve with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. But he
thought adding Anderson would affect the Patriots' salary cap, and
he also thought rookie Kevin Faulk and the acquisition of free
agent Terry Allen would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Through six games, the Patriots have averaged 2.9 yards per
carry. Their longest run of the season is 22 yards. When Curtis
Martin was in New England, he presented the threat of a 50-yard
gain. So far, there's no sign of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the line, if you must, but three players _ Bruce
Armstrong, Max Lane, and Todd Rucci _ were good enough to play on
the Patriots' Super Bowl team that ran the ball effectively enough
to augment Drew Bledsoe's passing. The differences in the Patriots'
line include Zefross Moss, who spent most of his career blocking
for Barry Sanders, and rookie Damien Woody, who opened some
significant holes for Mike Cloud at Boston College. The Patriots
also use Heath Irwin, a mobile lineman who is supposed to be able
to run block.
</P>
<P>
   But at some juncture, the focus has to be on the runners.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have to hope Faulk emerges as the lead runner. But
with kickoff and punt return responsibilities, it's also asking a
lot to cast Faulk in that role.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has been hampered by an ankle injury that kept him out of
the lineup for two weeks and ineffective in other games. The
Patriots knew they had a good returner when they drafted the former
Louisiana State star in the second round, but they were hoping he
could provide more than that. In the 1 1/2 games, Faulk was
healthy, he was tentative _ not hitting the hole with the authority
he had in training camp and the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has gained only 31 yards on 20 carries (a 1.6 average).
His mentor, Terry Allen, has carried 92 times for 318 yards (a 3.5
yard average), and has fumbled twice. Third-down back Lamont Warren
has gained 58 yards on 17 carries (a 3.4 average).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting around for (Faulk) to be at full speed,'' said
coach Pete Carroll. ``He had no setbacks this week. This is the
best he's felt in a long time. The little guys take longer to get
better. In our minds we want to use him more and more. We'd like to
mix it. Until we have both (Faulk and Allen) going at full go, it's
difficult to do what you've set out to do. I thought this would
happen 3-4 weeks into it, but we've had some problems and that
hasn't happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say all you want that you want to run the ball, but
talking about it doesn't get it done,'' said left tackle Armstrong,
whom the Patriots have run behind the majority of the time. ``We've
been talking about this for years, but you have to have the
attitude that you're going to do it and be successful with it. You
have to stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, however, don't stick with it. There's a school of
thought that you don't want Allen running the ball too much at this
stage of his career. But many running backs, such as Martin, get
better as they get into the flow of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But at which point is it the line's fault, and at which point do
the backs need to do a better job?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots run some tosses with Allen, a play in which he has
to make a key move to spring loose. That hasn't happened too often.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have tried different running plays out of different
formations, but it seems they are always slow developing. They've
actually run their best out of the shotgun formation, where they've
gained 34 yards on six carries.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the line-running back relationship. The line has to
learn the back's tendencies and where he likes to run. That's why
some teams go with one back so the line knows exactly where the
back is going to make his cuts. The Patriots have a running
back-by-committee philosophy, which makes it that much more
difficult for the line to learn tendencies. The other issue is the
line rotation. The Patriots insert Max Lane in many spots. That may
be fine for giving players a rest, but that, too, seems to be
breaking the continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the Patriots can't seem to keep Chris Floyd
on the field. Cut from the same mold as former Patriots stalwart
Sam Gash, the 237-pound fullback could help fill the void created
by the loss of Gash after the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos lost Terrell Davis, arguably the best back in the
league, for the season and his backup, rookie Olandis Gary, carried
37 times for 124 yards against Green Bay last Sunday. No Patriot
has come close to a 100-yard game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the past two weeks the Patriots have been
``big-play'' oriented, thinking they could beat the opposition with
long passes. ``But when you don't hit those, you waste some
opportunities to run the ball. I'm not saying we'd be successful
running it, but when you have more balance and you're actually
running it, it puts you in a better rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for us to give up on the run. I don't think
it's our production, it's our mix.''

COLUMBINE STUDENT IS ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING TO `FINISH THE
JOB' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ A Columbine High School senior is to face
charges on Friday after threatening, the authorities say, to
``finish the job'' of the two classmates who in April shot to death
12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old student, whose age has led the police to
withhold his identity, was arrested on Tuesday, one day shy of six
months since the carnage here. The authorities said he could be
charged with inciting destruction of life or property, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   The youth was transferred to a juvenile detention center on
Wednesday after a brief court appearance where bond was set at
$500,000. ``We asked for a large amount, for the safety of the
community,'' said Mark Pautler, chief deputy district attorney of
Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
   That a student might try to mimic the acts of Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold, the teen-agers responsible for the April shootings,
has been a widely shared fear at Columbine through the early part
of the school year. Many students acknowledged in recent days that
they were worried that something might happen on Wednesday, exactly
six months after the shootings, despite earlier efforts to upgrade
security at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears prompted administrators to bolster Columbine's
security force on Tuesday, when they added two armed officers to
the one sheriff's deputy who typically patrols the school grounds
along with three unarmed guards.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators said Thursday that as much as half the student
body stayed home from school on Wednesday, or left early, after
learning of the arrest the day before. Attendance, normally 95
percent, was 86 percent on Thursday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who skipped classes on Wednesday was Vernon Ragnone,
a 16-year-old sophomore. Speaking of the tension he had experienced
as the date precisely six months after the shootings approached, he
said: ``I didn't know what was going to happen, and I was kind of
freaked out. It's kind of scary to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Columbine students said they knew the youth arrested. Some
said he had taken a film class with Harris and Klebold in which the
three collaborated on videos, showing themselves dressed in long
black trench coats and pretending to shoot up the school. According
to published reports after the actual shootings, a student who had
worked with Harris and Klebold turned over such videos to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the Sheriff's Department said an
investigation that led to the arrest on Tuesday ``was initiated
after a student reported that the youth had remarked that he would
`finish the job started by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold' last
April 20.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dunaway, Jefferson County undersheriff, said of the youth
in custody, ``He may have had the intention, but it's not clear it
would have been possible to do what he desired to do.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they acted quickly on Tuesday to notify
parents and students of a threat once they learned from students
about rumors as to what the boy had said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the system is working,'' said Marilyn Saltzman,
spokeswoman for the Jefferson County schools. ``We acted upon the
information promptly; students communicated with adults about the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   But some parents said they had not been notified, and criticized
Columbine administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're hiding it, like it's a secret,'' said Connie
Michalik, the mother of a student who was injured in the April
shootings. ``They're trying to tell the world that they're taking
back the school and that it's back to normal. It's not. The kids
are still traumatized. They hear a loud noise, and everyone
jumps.''

   Where Online Traders Find Satisfaction &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Who's happiest with their e-broker? Online brokerage customers
of Fidelity Investments, according to a new survey by Spectrem
Group and NFO Interactive, two market research firms.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in June, polled 857 online investors. It
first asked investors what they considered the most important
attributes of their e-brokers' Web sites. If the answer was, say,
speed of execution, the survey then asked them how satisfied they
were on that count.
</P>
<P>
   In the No.2 spot was TD Waterhouse, followed by Charles Schwab
and DLJ Direct, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   What were investors' top priorities? The respondents were most
concerned that e-brokers keep their personal and portfolio data
secure, offer uninterrupted access, have credibility, offer value
and execute orders speedily. &QL;

   Fidelity's Big Three Look Bullish on Technology &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These is some good news for whipsawed technology investors. The
three biggest mutual funds managed by Fidelity Investments still
appear to be bullish on the sector.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Fidelity Mutual Fund Guide, which
includes portfolio information as of Sept. 30, technology remained
the largest industry holding for each of the gargantuan offerings _
and all three had slightly increased their exposure to the sector
since August.
</P>
<P>
   The Magellan fund, with $92.19 billion in assets as of Sept. 30,
raised its technology holdings to 22 percent of its portfolio from
21.3 percent a month earlier. Its top 10 stocks include the
technology staples Microsoft, Cisco Systems, and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The $45.99 billion Growth and Income fund increased its
technology exposure to 17.9 percent from 17.7 percent, with
Microsoft as its sole technology holding among its 10 top stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And the $41.04 billion Contrafund bumped up its technology
holdings to 21 percent of assets from 20.4 percent. The top
technology stocks in its top 10 holdings were Microsoft, Cisco and
Unisys. &QL;

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, Aug. 24,
about Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser, referred incompletely to the context of a comment he made
in 1991 that ``grand strategies'' were mostly rationales developed
after the fact to explain successful ad hoc decisions. Mr. Berger
made that remark at a panel discussion in which he talked about the
10 years in which he was developing an international law practice

FOLD BY CARDINALS IN 1996 HAUNTS JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The slugger conducted interviews adjacent to the
batting cage, flashing a wide smile, doing his best to describe his
team's drive to the World Series without becoming hyperbolic. The
``eye of the tiger'' reference showed Atlanta Braves right fielder
Brian Jordan needed more help with his verbiage than his swing.
</P>
<P>
   In was the hours before Game 3 of the National League
Championship Series, and when he wasn't obliging numerous media
requests, Jordan engaged in banter with teammates. It was as if he
deemed it his job to say all the right things while keeping the
Braves loose and upbeat. Atlanta led the New York Mets, two games
to none, and Jordan wanted his teammates to be able to focus only
on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   He was in position to silence a memory that haunted him for
three years, a painful reminder of what happens to a team that
fails to finish a seven-game series when the opportunity presents
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have memories every day about 1996 with the St. Louis
Cardinals,'' said Jordan, the former Cardinal who watched the
Braves rally from a 3-1 deficit to capture the 1996 NLCS by
outscoring the Cardinals, 32-1, the final three games.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Atlanta went on to win Game 4 to take a 3-0 lead, and
surely Jordan must have been having flashbacks when New York won
the next two game close the gap to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves finished New York with an extra-inning triumph in
Game 6, and now Jordan has another shot when the Braves meet the
New York Yankees in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did his part in helping the Braves to the NL pennant he
feels eluded him in '96. Jordan established a career high with 115
RBIs and matched his best output with 100 runs (he also scored 100
last season). At the All-Star break, he was hitting .295 with 17
home runs, 71 RBIs, and a .507 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He slowed down in the second half after being hit on the right
hand by a pitch from Montreal's Mike Thurman June 22. He dropped
off to a .266 average with 6 home runs, 44 RBIs, and a .405
slugging percentage after the break, but he had seven RBIs the last
week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan performed well in the clutch, hitting a team-high .317
with runners in scoring position. He batted .299 with runners in
scoring position with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Division Series against Houston, Jordan hit .471
with a home run and 7 RBIs. He drove in all five runs in a 5-3,
12-inning win in Game 3. In the NLCS, Jordan hit .200 (5 for 25)
with 2 home runs and 5 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But he considers none of that now, focusing solely on helping
the Braves avenge their 1996 Series defeat to the Yankees. ``I
don't even think about (accomplishments) until after the season,
because my job has yet to be finished,'' said Jordan. ``Your goal
is to win the world championship. I will have a chance to reminisce
once it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the catalyst in the Cardinals' run in the 1996 NLCS:
In Game 2, he went 2 for 4 in St. Louis's 8-3 win. In Game 4, the
Braves led, 3-0, behind Denny Neagle with two outs in the seventh,
but the Cardinals rallied to tie the score. Jordan provided the
winning run with a home run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said at the time, he implored his teammates to capture
Game 5 and the Series while it was still in St. Louis. ``Before
(Game 5), I said we have to win now, because if we go back to
Atlanta, the experience of their pitching staff is going to take
over, and they definitely did,'' said Jordan. ``So, I don't want to
take anything for granted. I want to kick you while you're down. I
don't even want it to be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, those same '96 Braves had a two-game lead on the
Yankees in the Series, only to lose the next four.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you have to have that attitude. I was so close once
before,'' said Jordan, who went 2 for 9 with no runs scored and no
RBIs over the last three games of the 1996 NLCS. The Braves won
Game 5, 14-0, and never looked back. ``We lost when we basically
had them, and that was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   After battling several injuries earlier in his career, Jordan,
who was named an All-Star for the first time this season, said it
doesn't bother him that he doesn't garner as much attention as
other players with similar statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've proven myself many times,'' he said. ``You're not going
to get all the credit you deserve; that's no problem. The bottom
line is I want to win. That's when I can look back and say, `Man,
hey, I won the world championship. I have a ring. I put up some
great numbers in the playoffs.' ''

BY WIDE MARGIN, HOUSE RENEWS SCHOOL AID TO THE POOR
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, in a rare display of bipartisanship,
voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to renew for five years the
largest federal program to help educate poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agreed, by a vote of 358-67, to extend Title I, the
federal program that has spent more than $100 billion since its
enactment in 1965 as a cornerstone of President Lyndon Johnson's
Great Society. The program reaches 10 million of the nation's
neediest children.
</P>
<P>
   In a stinging rebuff to conservatives, the House rejected a
voucher plan that could have given families of poor children $3,500
each to attend private schools if their public schools were failing
academically or deemed unsafe. Opponents had expressed fears that
vouchers would drain students _ and, by extension, public money _
away from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Education has become a battleground issue for candidates in the
2000 presidential and Congressional campaigns, with Republican and
Democratic rivals promising to increase federal spending on
education. The House bill would increase annual spending on the
Title I program to $9.9 billion from $7.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other hot political issues, like tax cuts or gun
control, in which Democrats and Republicans have seen greater
political advantage in confrontation than compromise, lawmakers
largely buried their party differences on Thursday to show their
support for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They each want to preserve their role as the education
party,'' said Vicki P. Rafel, vice president for legislation for
the national Parent-Teacher Association.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the measure marked the third major education bill the
House has approved in a session defined by its lack of significant
accomplishments. In April, Congress approved a bill that gave
states and local schools more flexibility in how they spend more
than $10 billion in federal education money each year. In July, the
House approved a $2 billion bill for teacher training and
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Broad bipartisan support for the bill staved off efforts by
conservatives to attach amendments allowing taxpayer-financed
vouchers to private schools for students in academically failing
public schools. Voucher plans would have drawn a sure veto from
President Clinton, dooming the entire bill.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans, led by Rep. Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, had
fended off voucher amendments in committee, and joined virtually
all Democrats on Thursday to reject two different voucher
provisions, by votes of 257-166 and 271-153.
</P>
<P>
   One plan offered by the House majority leader, Dick Armey of
Texas, would have set aside $500 million over five years to give
annual vouchers of $3,500 each, redeemable at private schools, to
27,000 students at failing public schools. ``No child should be
trapped in a school that's failing or unsafe,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said the voucher plans would siphon taxpayer money
away from public schools that need it the most, and would violate
the constitutional separation of church and state, since many
private schools are church-based.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives suffered another setback when a second
Republican-backed bill to allow states and schools to pool a wide
array of targeted federal education grants into a lump sum that
schools could use for any purpose, was watered down to a pilot
program limited to 10 states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the past several weeks, Republican moderates have been eager
to show that they could produce a popular education bill free of
the divisive voucher issue. The Title I program provides $300 to
$1,500 a student to schools in almost every congressional district,
enabling principals to hire teachers for remedial classes and buy
textbooks, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which is backed by the Clinton administration, would
require schools to compile new information about the performance of
their students and their schools, and their teachers'
qualifications. Much of this information is rarely disclosed
publicly _ for example, whether teachers are licensed or trained to
teach the class to which they have been assigned.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would also allow parents in failing schools to transfer their
children to other schools in the same district _ but only those
that are public.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result will be that the most disadvantaged youngsters,
the children who need us the most, will benefit from this
program,'' Goodling said. ``They will not continue to be left
behind. We cannot afford to leave them behind.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House, which is reauthorizing the 1965 Elementary and
Secondary Education Act in pieces, including Title I, the Senate is
wrestling with the entire bill at once. A draft is circulating in
the Senate Health and Education Committee, and could be acted on by
the end of the month.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In two days of floor debate, Representatives this week jousted
over the merits of Title I, and to what extent it had succeeded in
bridging the education gap between the nation's most disadvantaged
and more affluent children.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The results have been mixed,'' Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
said on Wednesday. ``We have closed the gap to some extent between
rich and poor, majority and minority students, but the gap remains
wide and it remains open.'' Critics complain that Congress has
poured money into the program for 35 years with scant success. ``It
is really a total failure,'' said Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who
opposed the bill. ``Yet the money goes up continuously.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Executives of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. have
been boasting this week about their new online stock trading
service and the head start they got on their competitors on Wall
Street. But when it came to the Internet address they desired,
somebody got a jump on them.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is telling the story, that somebody is either a
17-year-old schoolboy who created a Web site to share his passion
for mountain-bike racing, or an opportunistic ``cybersquatter'' who
registered dozens of Internet addresses in a scheme to exact
ransoms from big-name corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the domain name, or Web address, that Morgan Stanley
coveted takes a Web surfer not to its electronic brokerage but
instead to what appears to be a site dedicated to mountain biking.
It carries a photo of a helmeted cyclist under the title Mud
Sweat's Downhill World.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wong, a senior at a private high school in Los Altos,
Calif., says he created the site and named it after Mud Sweat &AMP;
Gears, the shop that sold him his mountain bikes. ``Me and my
friends saw other sites on the Net,'' he said, sitting with his
parents in the dining room of their spacious home in the
Hillsborough hills overlooking Silicon Valley. ``We wanted to start
our own, with a bunch of pictures and videos and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley filed suit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
alleging that Ivan's Web site infringes on the firm's trademarks.
Morgan Stanley is asking a judge to stop Ivan from using the domain
name.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, it seems a touching anecdote about a boy who
stumbled into the path of a profit-seeking juggernaut. But turn the
page and the story veers away from David and Goliath into a tale
more characteristic of this get-rich-with-a-click era.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a company set up by Ivan's father, Sau Wong,
has registered dozens of domain names, many of them derived from
the names of investment banks. Among them are
goldmansachsdirect.com and jpmorganonline.com. In Morgan Stanley's
view, the case is a blatant example of cybersquatting, the practice
of registering Internet addresses in hopes of reselling them to
companies or organizations that have a commercial use for them.
Some companies have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, but
others, like Morgan Stanley, have gone to court to obtain addresses
that they claim are rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed this week in its lawsuit, Morgan Stanley
alleged that ``the defendant in this case has targeted MSDW and the
New York investment banking community with particular precision and
malice.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of walking away, as many cybersquatters do when they
are sued by large corporations, Ivan is holding his ground. ``We've
hired three teams of attorneys to fight this,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wong said it was coincidental that the site had a name so
similar to Morgan Stanley's main Web site, www.msdw.com. ``It was
pretty ironic how they would have the same name as us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sau Wong's company, Smart Ideas, registered www.msdwonline.com
in May, several weeks before Morgan Stanley officials settled on a
new name for their online brokerage. In late July, a marketing
executive discovered that the obvious domain name for the new unit
was already taken. So the big securities firm had to introduce its
overhauled electronic brokerage, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online,
Thursday with a not-so-intuitive address on the World Wide Web,
www.online.msdw.com.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the firm, one of the biggest on Wall Street,
located the apparent owners and began negotiating with online
correspondents they believed to be Ivan and his 18-year-old
brother, Ben. They offered to pay what a company representative
called a ``reasonable fee'' for the domain name.
</P>
<P>
   The response that came by an electronic message: ``Give us an
offer we cannot refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley quickly bid $10,000, a sum that Alejandro Levins,
who was representing Morgan Stanley, described to one of the boys
as ``a nice bag of money for a guy your age,'' according to
documents Morgan Stanley filed in court.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the tone of the online negotiations hardened,
according to the court documents. The sellers demanded $75,000 for
the domain name and when Levins balked, he received a message that
said, ``By the way, you are not dealing with a kid. I am the father
of Ben and Ivan...I am an entrepreneur myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dispatch to a Morgan Stanley executive, apparently from
Sau Wong, opened with this note, ``As you may not be aware, some
`useful' domain names can fetch as much as six (6) figures or
more.'' It went on to describe Smart Ideas as ``an innovative and
forward-looking company'' that had ``registered many relevant
domain names covering some of the major competitors of your parent
company. Our rationale is that all brokerage houses, which do not
have online trading today, will eventually provide that service.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong then lowered his asking price to $50,000 and later offered
to throw in another domain name his company had registered,
morganstanleydirect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Morgan Stanley officials rescinded their offer of
$10,000 and filed suit on Aug. 13.

</P>
<P>
   In court documents, executives allege that the mountain-biking
theme that now appears on the Web site did not appear there until
10 days after the suit was filed, ``in a transparent attempt to
conceal its fraudulent ransom scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   They now think they were dealing all along with Sau Wong, who
says he is a computer-chip engineer who has worked in Silicon
Valley for 25 years. But Wong and Ivan tried to dispel that notion
in an interview, saying the idea of registering domain names had
been Ivan's from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan said he had read an article that said the people who
register domain names can sometimes profit from them. ``In school,
we learned about freedom of speech,'' he said, adding that one of
his teachers had told him that ``if you got a (Web site) first, you
can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a 17-year-old came up with the names of so many
investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, Ivan said his father gave
him the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Goldman Sachs account,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ivan and his father insisted that they didn't solicit
buyers for any of the domain names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not beggars,'' Wong said. ``We do not need to beg.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybersquatting has created a storm of legal controversy.
Trademark holders are getting more support from the courts and from
Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit
corporation that oversees the registration of domain names, legal
experts said. So many disputes over the rights to domain names have
landed in court that ICANN is trying to set up a mandatory
arbitration system to settle them.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, a 16-year-old Canadian boy incurred the
wrath of Apple Computer Inc. when he registered the domain name
www.appleimac.com after Apple introduced its iMac personal
computer. He said he would use it to draw traffic to his Web-based
business but would consider selling it. But after hearing from
Apple's lawyers, he renounced ownership of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some judges don't see speculating in domain names as so
harmful, said Pam Samuelson, a professor of law at the University
of California at Berkeley. ``One could say that cybersquatting is
just another example of American ingenuity,'' she said. ``These
people are going out and creating things that somebody else might
find of value. In a sense, they're entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Samuelson said that ``This doesn't seem to be an
open-and-shut case'' of trademark infringement. The trademark in
question, MSDW, is relatively new _Morgan Stanley merged with Dean
Witter in 1997 _ and not that famous, she said. A federal statute
enacted in 1995 was expressly aimed at stopping cybersquatters from
diluting the value of established trademarks.

FRAUD TRIAL BEGINS FOR FORMER TEAMSTER OFFICIAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors detailed their case Thursday
against the Teamsters' former political director, William Hamilton,
accusing him of conspiring with Democratic Party officials, the
AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer and others to siphon union money to
the 1996 re-election drive of Ron Carey, the Teamsters' former
president.
</P>
<P>
   In opening arguments at Hamilton's trial on charges of
embezzling union money, conspiracy, fraud and perjury, Robert Rice,
an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Hamilton had worked
with two top Carey campaign officials to divert $885,000 in union
money to Carey's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rice asserted that Hamilton had taken part in several complex
schemes in which Teamster money was donated to liberal political
groups, and in exchange long-time donors to those groups
contributed to the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Hamilton and the Carey campaign aides had looted
the union's treasury, Rice said, ``The scheme can best be described
as a swap scheme, a quid pro quo, a you'll-scratch my back and I'll
scratch yours.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton's lawyer, Robert Gage, responded that his client
was innocent of the charges, which were filed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gage asserted that Hamilton was the victim of swap schemes that
he said were orchestrated by Carey's direct mail consultant, Martin
Davis, to insure that the Carey campaign had money to pay the
$700,000 it owed Davis' firm for campaign mailings. Davis and Jere
Nash, Carey's campaign manager, have pleaded guilty to carrying out
the swap schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Gage described his client as an idealist who approved big
Teamsters donations to liberal groups, not to advance Carey's
campaign, but to help restore Democratic control of Congress and
elect a Congress that would be friendlier to unions.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said Hamilton, as well as Davis and Nash, carried out the
swap schemes, in which $735,000 was donated to three liberal groups
_ Citizen Action, the National Council of Senior Citizens and
Project Vote, which focuses on getting low-income and minority
people to vote. As part of those schemes, wealthy contributors to
those groups donated $185,000 to the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carey narrowly defeated James P. Hoffa in the 1996 race for the
Teamsters presidency, but federal monitors ordered a new election
and ousted Carey from the office after determining that he breached
his fiduciary duty by not stopping his campaign aides from carrying
out the swap schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Rice described another scheme in which he said Hamilton approved
a $150,000 Teamster payment to the AFL-CIO. Days after, the labor
federation contributed $150,000 to Citizen Action, which in turn
paid $100,000 to Davis' direct-mail firm. The prosecutor said
Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer, had requested
the $150,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Trumka has insisted on his innocence
and has invoked the Fifth Amendment in declining to testify on the
matter. No charges have been brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice also said Davis had approached Terry McAuliffe, the finance
chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign, to propose that the
Teamsters would contribute large sums to the Democrats if DNC
officials got Democratic donors to give to Carey. Rice said
McAuliffe had Davis talk to two other Democratic finance officials,
Laura Hartigan and Richard Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Sullivan sent Hamilton a list of suggested
contributions to state Democratic parties and that soon after, the
Teamsters donated $236,000 to various state parties. In the past,
federal investigators have said that the Democrats were
unsuccessful in finding donors for the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, Ms. Hartigan and Sullivan have all repeatedly denied
any wrongdoing. No charges have been brought against any DNC
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was planning on making the donations to the Democratic
state parties, Gage said, even before Sullivan made his request.
Gage argued that Davis and Nash knew of Hamilton's intention to
make large donations to the Democrats and that Davis parlayed this
knowledge to try to manipulate DNC officials so they would arrange
for Democratic donors to give to Carey.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the details laid out by prosecutors Thursday have been
made public, but the airing of those details in court is bound to
once again throw Democratic and AFL-CIO officials on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Collins, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, did not hide the Republicans intent to gain political
mileage from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for the country to understand how a
million dollars in workers' money was diverted to the benefit of
the Clinton-Gore '96 campaign and the Democratic National
Committee,'` he said. ``What's going to be obvious is there are a
lot of people who should be sitting in the dock with Hamilton.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Backus, the DNC's press secretary, said, ``This matter
has been investigated by three Congressional committees as well as
the Justice Department, and these investigations turned up no
indication that any DNC employee or official acted in any improper
or unlawful way.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Rice called the defendant a ``Teamster
insider.'' But Gage countered by telling the jury that Hamilton,
57, had spent many years working for civil rights and abortion
rights and had more recently dedicated himself to fighting ``the
Gingrich Congress'' and rebuffing Republican efforts to undercut
workers' rights.

 &HT;    Benson aiming to stay on track
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Winston Cup driver Johnny Benson is known for his
cool, calm and collected ways on the race track. His style remains
unchanged as he faces a near-crisis situation off the track.
</P>
<P>
   Benson and Ted Musgrave are the circuit's only full-time drivers
without a ride for next season. Opportunities seem to decrease by
the day, but Benson expresses only minimal concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like there are still opportunities out there,'' Benson
said. ``I'm not panicking, because I don't feel like I am in a
panic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Albright has known Benson since they worked together on the
ARCA circuit in 1990. Albright, hired as Benson's manager four
years ago, said his client's laid-back demeanor is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny's temperament is even in every situation,'' Albright
said. ``If there were any other way he was reacting to what is
obviously a highly stressful situation, then it wouldn't be the
Johnny Benson I know.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is it's probably tougher on him in the inside than he
ever shows on the outside. But he still has a knack for handling
difficult situations calmly. I mean, he's not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have faith that the Lord has got the best thing for us
out there, and we are just waiting to see what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson decided to part ways with the No. 26 Fords of Roush
Racing after the season's final four races, which includes Sunday's
Pop Secret 400 at Rockingham, N.C. He already has turned down at
least two rides for next year and politely declined to join A.J.
Foyt's new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of things I'm looking at,'' Benson said,
without revealing details. ``I know it's getting late in the year,
but, hopefully, I'll find something shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to pursue opportunities known to the public,
then there are others that the general public is not even aware
that exist, at this point,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Benson was dissatisfied with his track
record at Roush during the past two seasons, and he went to great
lengths to dissolve the relationship. Benson had to buy out the
final two years of his contract. Because of a lucrative sponsorship
with General Mills, Benson walked away from a seven-figure income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can say a paycheck is not important, but
I think he is a racer, deep down,'' said Benson's father, John.
``He wants to race and do well. He is just not content with the
ways things are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, 36, had a rapid rise through the racing ranks and was
considered the hottest prospect two years ago. He joined Roush
after two prosperous seasons at Ba'hari Racing, including an
11th-place finish in the 1997 points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at Roush, Benson has regressed. He was 20th in
the points last season, 26th in the current standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be racing better,'' Benson said. ``And for some
reason, it is not happening. Somebody had to do something. Nobody
wants to run 20th. I don't want to, and (Roush) doesn't want to.
So, a change needed to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush, one of the top multicar teams in the sport, fields the
teams of Mark Martin and Jeff Burton. Unlike Martin and Burton,
Benson's shop is located in Liberty, N.C., nearly 100 miles from
Charlotte, which makes it more difficult to hire top personnel.
Owner Jack Roush promised to move Benson to the Charlotte area by
the beginning of this season, but it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say `politically correct,' but Johnny has
handled this situation in the most positive way he could,'' said
Benson's sister, Barb, president of the driver's fan club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got to the point where he said, `Enough was enough,
and another year in this situation was not good for me, the team or
the sponsors,''' she said. ``I think he felt he did the best with
what he could do and with the decisions he could make, which
weren't many. He felt it was time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson declines to criticize Roush. He wants to keep a low
profile and quietly finish the season, then try to rejuvenate his
once-flourishing career with another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny is not throwing rocks at Roush Racing or anybody on
that team,'' Albright said. ``As anyone in racing knows, it takes
30-35 people to have a successful race team. Sometimes it clicks,
sometimes it doesn't.''

 &HT;    Brunette beats rap as poor skater
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The tag, Andrew Brunette suspects, has been with
him since he was filling up nets as a 12-year-old in northern
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach told me one day, `As you go on, don't let your skating
ever stop you from being successful,' '' the Thrashers forward
said. ``He was saying, `Don't get down about this.' Until then, I
didn't even know anything was wrong. Ever since then, it stuck with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Good hands, bad skates. It's the scouting report Brunette has
lived with throughout his career. Fortunately, he hasn't had to
hear too much about his skating recently.
</P>
<P>
   Brunette, the first forward under contract to the Thrashers,
also is first in scoring, with four goals _ three on the power play
_ and six points in six games. He has been one of the team's few
players who has worked himself into scoring position and has taken
advantage of it with a scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see what kind of player he is below the tops of the
(face-off) circle,'' coach Curt Fraser said. ``For him to be
successful, we have to get him the puck down low. He's got fast
hands. In training camp for the first few games, we really couldn't
see where he could help us, because most of the play was in the
neutral zone. But now he's getting down low, and that makes all the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunette, who usually skates on a line with center Ray Ferraro
and right winger Steve Staios, hopes he can be more consistent than
he was last year in Nashville, Tenn. He scored five goals in his
first 10 games with the Predators but went another 17 games before
scoring his sixth, and finished with only 11.
</P>
<P>
   His two primary aims this year are to exceed that total and, if
at all possible, stay in one place. Washington left him unprotected
in the 1998 expansion draft for Nashville. The Predators,
disappointed with Brunette's production _ he had 11 goals in only
28 games for the Capitals _ shipped him to Atlanta for a
conditional draft pick in 2000 a few days before the 1999 expansion
draft. After two expansion teams in two years, the safe assumption
is that Brunette has no desire to be a Columbus Blue Jacket or
Minnesota Wild next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really something you want to brag about,'' he said,
laughing. ``But there's a real positive side to being on an
expansion team and seeing it built up. Last year, we used it as
motivation. You would hear people say, `Expansion isn't good for
hockey,' and then we'd go beat Detroit. So how bad could it be?''
</P>
<P>
   Originally a draft pick by Washington in 1993, Brunette
estimates that he was called up from the minors and returned 23
times by the Capitals in three seasons. The move to Nashville was
more a rescue than a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   He is used to the knocks on his skating ability by now. It
didn't stop him from scoring 62 goals one year in the juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always heard that I couldn't make it at the next level,''
Brunette said. ``When I was young I was told, `Well, you'll have a
hard time in the juniors.' In the juniors I was told, `You won't
make it in the pros.' In the AHL, they said, `You're OK at this
level, but you won't make it in the NHL.' But I tried to play smart
enough to not let that get in the way. I know I'm not going to win
a race with Sergei Fedorov, but I still think I can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I didn't think I was that slow. But when everybody
keeps telling you that, it gets in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, speed isn't a requirement when you're situated 10
feet from the net.

<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The personal computer industry has a variety of
things to worry about these days, but it turns out that supply
problems from the deadly earthquake in Taiwan last month may not be
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to foresight, providence and factory workers who toiled
around the clock through a traditional Chinese festival, the
disaster a month ago that killed more than 2,000 people seems not
to have caused the widespread shortage of semiconductors many
experts feared.
</P>
<P>
   And though several American high-technology producers have
warned that such shortages could crimp earnings and make it hard to
meet the coming holiday-season demands for personal computers, some
of the biggest suppliers to those companies say not only that they
are back to normal, but also that they have managed to fill most of
their September orders.
</P>
<P>
   Chips are the brains of computers, and warnings from computer
makers about the impact of the Taiwan quake may just reflect the
industry tendency of making cautionary predictions. But the stark
divergence between the appraisals from corporations in the United
States and the optimism close to the quake's center is leading some
analysts and executives to wonder whether the companies are perhaps
blaming Mother Nature for other, man-made problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a company doesn't make its numbers, they try to come
up with a reason,'' said Dane Anderson, a manager at International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan companies are important subcontractors for
high-technology consumer products and components. They produce
electronics that go into some of the world's best-known brands,
including IBM, Motorola and Toshiba, and Taiwan is the world's
third-largest source of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   This month, at least four U.S. companies warned of potential
problems caused by the quake. The chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard told analysts that the company was sure to suffer
disruptions and delays. Advanced Micro Devices said problems in
Taiwan had hampered production of its new Athlon microprocessor and
could slow sales this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, though saying it expected no ``material impact,'' warned
retailers that it would be unable to fill all their orders this
month. And on Monday, Dell said a spike in prices for memory chips
would hurt earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for personal computers, particularly portables, has been
strong all year and the last three months of the year tend to be
the strongest. But fierce competition to offer buyers an array of
the latest features at lower prices has eroded profit margins and
forced manufacturers to keep less stock on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Taiwan quake, analysts said, personal computer
makers faced short supplies of hard-disk drives and of flat-panel
screens for laptops. The booming market for mobile phones,
moreover, has led some semiconductor makers to divert capacity from
making chips for personal computers to making more profitable chips
for phones.
</P>
<P>
   Though Taiwan's semiconductor companies largely avoided
structural damage, production was halted by a weeklong power
cutoff. And despite soaring prices for memory chips, Taiwan
represents relatively little threat to global supplies: it accounts
for about 12 percent of the world's production.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the greatest risk was a shortage of more complex
logic chips used to run computer graphics and sound, as well as to
control hard-disk drives. Companies would need weeks, they had
predicted, to recalibrate sensitive equipment and run tests to make
sure that their intricate chips functioned properly.
</P>
<P>
   Some delays remain inevitable. An executive at Acer Laboratories
in the United States said this week that the Taiwan-based Acer had
delayed shipments of chip sets, which link logic chips to the rest
of the computer, and that computer makers would probably fall short
of their production targets as a result.
</P>
<P>
   When the quake hit, it shut down the island's largest chip
producer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend was the Midautumn Festival, an event celebrated
across Asia. At Taiwan Semiconductor, employees who would normally
be home nibbling moon cakes worked through the night to put the
company's factories back in order, said Ron Norris, the senior vice
president for worldwide sales and marketing. Power was restored by
Saturday and by the following Tuesday, the company was back up to
90 percent of production. Roughly 23,000 silicon wafers, each
containing as many as 1,000 chips, had to be scrapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company was fortunate: rather than store its wafers
in big open containers, it had begun keeping them in sealed ones,
Norris said, which reduced damage and contamination. Even so, he
said, ``There's about two weeks of production that are just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of supply should have affected Asustek Computer, a
leading manufacturer of motherboards, the circuit boards that hold
many of the chips in a computer. Asustek plugs the chips into
motherboards before they are installed, and it had only three or
four weeks of chips on hand when the quake struck. David Chan, a
company spokesman, said Asustek's employees worked through the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   With power off during the day, employees fired up a generator
and turned off the lights and air-conditioners. Power came on at
night, so they set up a graveyard shift, he said. The result: the
company missed less than 1 percent of its September orders,
according to Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite damage in excess of $2 billion from the quake, soaring
demand for electronics enabled Taiwan to post a nearly 1 percent
increase in exports in September.
</P>
<P>
   Norris speculated that given the amount of inventory typically
built up between a chip's manufacture and the time it ends up in a
personal computer, Taiwan's electronics companies should be able to
meet this quarter's demand for PCs with few disruptions. ``That's
why I'm concerned about anybody placing any dramatic impact on
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the quake has underscored the risks of
manufacturing on an island that straddles an earthquake fault line.
Taiwan's electronics companies are already taking steps to protect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Winbond Electronics, another chip maker, said this week that it
was reconsidering building a new factory in the same industrial
park as its five other plants and that it was looking overseas.
Asustek said it would seek permission to build two plants in China.

STUDY SHOWS VASECTOMIES DON'T INCREASE CHANCES OF PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Men with vasectomies can breathe easier now thanks to
new data that show they have no greater risk of getting prostate
cancer than men without vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The same study, the largest ever to look at prostate cancer risk
and vasectomies, also found that taking zinc, vitamin C or vitamin
E may significantly reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
in Seattle, and was designed to resolve a lingering debate over
whether vasectomies predispose a man to prostate cancer. The
results are being published Friday in Cancer Epidemiology,
Biomarkers and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body of evidence shows there's no association between
vasectomies and prostate cancer,'' said Dr. Janet Stanford, head of
the Prostate Cancer Research Program in the Hutchinson Center's
Public Health Sciences Division and lead author of the study.
``This should be very reassuring to all the men out there and to
physicians who do vasectomies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, who also is a research professor in the Department of
Epidemiology at the University of Washington, said previous studies
have given conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began in 1990 after two studies showed a higher
frequency of vasectomies in men hospitalized for prostate cancer
than in men hospitalized for other reasons, she said. However, the
studies were flawed and their findings later questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the National Cancer Institute paid for a $1.8 million
study to try to reach a definitive answer. Fred Hutchinson was one
of two centers chosen to look at the question, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,456 men aged 40 to 64 interviewed for the study, 753
were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1993 and 1996 and 703
were men in the general King County population with no history of
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of vasectomies was about the same in each group.
Of men with prostate cancer, 39.4 percent had undergone a
vasectomy, compared with 37.7 percent of the non-cancer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who have had vasectomies don't need to continue to
worry,'' she said. Nationally, about 14 percent of currently
married men under age 45 have had vasectomies, a surgical
contraceptive procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed solid tumor in
men. This year, an estimated 170,000 men will be diagnosed with the
disease in the United States, and 37,000 will die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Between 20 and 25 percent of all prostate cancer cases are
diagnosed in men under age 65.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dispelling fears about vasectomies and prostate
cancer, the study also yielded some unexpected results regarding
dietary supplements and cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   When men in the study were asked about their lifestyle habits,
fewer than one-third said they took a daily multivitamin. Only 21
percent said they took vitamin C, while 14 percent took vitamin E,
and 5 percent took daily doses of zinc, calcium or vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   Men who took daily doses of vitamin C or vitamin E had a 23
percent lower risk of prostate cancer, while those who took zinc
daily decreased their risk by 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers cautioned that the results were suggestive,
not conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so few studies of dietary supplements and
prostate-cancer risk that even with these results we still don't
know enough about it to make any recommendations,'' said Dr. Alan
Kristal, a member of the Cancer Prevention Research Program at Fred
Hutchinson and professor of epidemiology at the UW. Kristal led the
analysis of the supplement data.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that zinc levels are lower in cancerous
prostate tissue than in healthy prostate tissue, leading to
speculation that zinc may play a role in regulating healthy
prostate growth, Stanford said.
</P>
<P>
   The news on reducing prostate risk follows reports earlier this
week that scientists are making progress on a possible prostate
cancer vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Using a virus to insert new genes into cancerous cells,
scientists at Johns Hopkins Oncology Center have been able to trick
the immune systems of prostate cancer patients into thinking tumors
were ``foreign substances'' that should be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe one reason tumors grow is that the immune
system fails to recognize the cancerous cells. The immune system
still sees the cancer cells as part of the ``self'' that should not
be attacked. By priming cancer cells with genes that signal the
immune system to form antibodies, scientists were able to create a
vaccine that triggered the body to attack the tumors. The results
were published in the October issue of the journal Cancer Research.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A major New York publishing house suspended
distribution and promotion of a controversial new biography of
George W. Bush on Thursday after a Texas newspaper reported that
the book's author was convicted 11 years ago of hiring a
professional killer in a failed attempt to murder his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the publisher, St. Martin's Press, said they wanted
to conduct their own inquiry into the background and reporting
methods of the author, J.H. Hatfield, before continuing to push the
sale of his book, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of
an American President,'' which began appearing on store shelves
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes the claim _ attributed entirely to anonymous
sources _ that Bush, now governor of Texas and front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, was arrested for cocaine
possession in 1972 and that a judge promptly expunged the record as
a favor to Bush's father. Although both Bush and his father, former
President George Bush, unequivocally denied the accusation earlier
this week, it appeared in many prominent publications.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with St. Martin's Press said they were now concerned
about the reliability of the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Mr. Hatfield's credibility has been called into serious
question, we feel compelled to suspend publication,'' Sally
Richardson, the president and publisher of the trade division of
St. Martin's, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Richardson said Hatfield had told
an executive of the publishing house that he was being confused
with someone else and, contrary to what The Dallas Morning News
reported on Thursday, was not a felon on parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get to the bottom of this,'' Ms. Richardson
said. ``We just don't know what to think at this point. We are
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield, reached by telephone at his home in Arkansas, said
lawyers had instructed him not to talk to reporters about the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment late last week when St. Martin's began promoting
``Fortunate Son'' on the strength of its final chapter, which is
devoted to the account of a cocaine arrest, Bush and his aides have
emphatically denied the accusation, pointing out numerous factors
that render it implausible.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times received an advanced copy of the book last
week, and reporters from the paper spent several days trying to
corroborate Hatfield's account. But they did not find any, and the
newspaper did not publish anything about the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Bush labeled it ``science fiction'' during an appearance in
Scottsdale, Ariz., on Monday. On Thursday, campaigning in
Spartanburg, S.C., he said that if Hatfield was indeed a felon,
``it reflects on his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then his credibility was nothing to me anyway,'' Bush
said. ``His story was totally ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Department of Criminal Justice in Texas,
where Hatfield used to live, provided records on Thursday showing
that a man named James H. Hatfield was convicted in 1988 of
solicitation of capital murder and served five years in a Texas
prison. The spokesman, Larry Fitzgerald, said that the man was
paroled in 1993 and put under the supervision of a parole agency in
Arkansas, where the book's author lives.
</P>
<P>
   The age and other biographical information of the convicted
felon _ who had wanted the hit man to use a car bomb _ matched
those of the book's author, the Dallas Morning News reported. An
Arkansas parole official told the newspaper that his records showed
that the convicted felon was the author of an unauthorized
biography of the actor Patrick Stewart, which is one of the books
attributed to the author of ``Fortunate Son'' in promotional
materials provided by St. Martin's.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the article in the Dallas Morning News appeared,
Hatfield seemed an odd fit for a biography of Bush. In addition to
the book on Stewart, the star of the television show ``Star Trek:
The Next Generation,'' Hatfield had written a mass-market paperback
on the actor Ewan McGregor, the star of the summer movie ``The
Phantom Menace,'' and trivia-style books on the television shows
``The X-Files'' and ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives with St. Martin's, however, noted that Hatfield's
resume also included the fact that he had contributed articles to
reputable Texas publications, and they said that his proposal for
the book had come from a respected Manhattan literary agency,
Richard Curtis Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's agent, Laura Tucker, has since switched from that
firm to a new one, but declined to take a telephone call on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with St. Martin's said that the publishing house
would not try to arrange any promotional interviews or appearances
for Hatfield until St. Martin's lawyers had resolved questions
about his past. They said that St. Martin's reserved the right to
resume the distribution and promotion of the book and had not made
any final decisions yet.
</P>
<P>
   The book had received a large first printing of 90,000 copies,
70,000 of which were already in stores or on their way there. The
20,000 copies still in warehouses would not be shipped for the time
being, Ms. Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear today how many, if any, sellers would pull
from shelves the copies of ``Fortunate Son'' that they had already
received. Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble
Inc., said late Thursday that the chain intended to continue
providing the book to customers.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, Bush, the leading candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, has been asked publicly about persistent
rumors of drug use in his past. He has mostly refused to answer the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, he gave a little ground, saying that he could
verify that he had not used any illegal drugs in the past 25 years.
Hatfield wrote the final chapter of his book after that point and
tried to use that marker as a supporting point for his contention
that Bush was arrested 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunate Son'' had initially been scheduled for publication
in January, but was rushed into print to compete with ``First Son:
George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty,'' a book by Bill
Minutaglio, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, that Times
Books published this month.
</P>
<P>
   Minutaglio said in a telephone interview on Thursday that there
had long been a rumor about Bush being arrested in 1972 and that he
had done reporting to try to confirm it, but that it appeared to be
untrue.

MORE THAN 100 KILLED IN DEVASTATING GROZNY MISSILE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ At least 10 bombs devastated a downtown market and
maternity hospital in Grozny, Chechnya, on Thursday evening,
according to reports from the breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions killed scores of people and injured hundreds
more. Chechen officials told The Associated Press that at least 118
people died and upward of 400 were injured, though the reports
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters on the scene told of body parts strewn across market
stalls and corpses stacked in the city's darkened main hospital
after the attacks, which occurred about 6:15 p.m. Thursday, local
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge number of people were killed,'' said Alkha Tosuyev, a
cameraman for the Reuters news agency, describing the scene at the
market. ``Some who were sitting in a cafe, some who were selling
things at booths, some just walking by. Teen-agers. Children. It
was a horror. Counting the wounded was nightmarish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosuyev said he had counted 60 dead at the market alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen officials said the explosions came from ground-to-ground
missiles fired by Russian forces that now are barely more than
eight miles from downtown Grozny. The Associated Press quoted
witnesses as saying Russian warplanes, which were buzzing the city
Thursday night, had bombed the central market.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry flatly denied any
role in the attacks, many of which clustered around the residence
of Chechnya's president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Other senior officials, including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
pointedly left open the prospect that troops would invade Grozny.
Putin, in Helsinki, Finland, for a meeting with leaders of the
European Union, said that military moves would ``depend on the
concrete situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Itar-Tass news agency quoted a senior Russian official as
saying troops planned to consolidate their positions around Grozny.
And the deputy defense minister, Gen. Vladimir Toporov, said
Russian soldiers or civil authorities would enter Grozny ``sooner
or later.''
</P>
<P>
   That would set up a confrontation with Chechen armed forces and
rebel guerrillas that the Russian authorities have repeatedly said
they want to avoid. The last time Russian troops tried to crush an
internal revolt in Chechnya, in a two-year war that ended in 1996,
some 80,000 people died, and Grozny was all but leveled by Russian
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin ended that stalemated war by granting
the Chechens an unspoken form of independence and postponing any
official decision on the state of the republic until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But after Islamic fundamentalists left Chechnya and invaded
neighboring Dagestan this summer and a series of terrorist bombs in
Moscow and elsewhere killed nearly 300 Russians, Russian troops
struck back hard, marching into Chechnya last month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Kremlin's assurances that troops were only seeking
to build a security zone around Chechnya, Russian forces have
steadily advanced toward the capital. At last count, nearly 90,000
Russian soldiers were involved in the operation, far more than were
involved in the 21-month Chechen war of three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have played down the conflict, shunning terms
like ``rebellion'' in favor of labeling their military action as an
antiterrorist operation.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many Chechens are said to oppose the uprising, and the
Russian government has seized on that possibility. A statement
issued Thursday assured Chechen citizens that its soldiers were
defending them against bandits and that they ``should know that
they will receive protection and help from the Russian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday evening's attacks, which went largely unmentioned
on Moscow's main television news programs, seemed to be
distinguished by their grisly nature.
</P>
<P>
   By various reports, five or six rockets or aerial bombs were
said to have struck the central market at rush hour, sending
hundreds of screaming shoppers into the streets and leaving behind
scores of dead and pools of blood.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Umar Madayev, told The Associated Press: ``It was
dark and then all of a sudden the place was illuminated and
something was sparkling in the air. Then we heard the explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   Agence France-Presse reported that at least 27 people, many of
them mothers and newborn children, died when a rocket or bomb
struck a maternity hospital wing some 80 feet from the presidential
residence on Grozny's central square.
</P>
<P>
   Other rockets or bombs were said to have hit a mosque, killing
perhaps a dozen people, but that report too was unverified.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening's attacks seemed destined to raise a din of
protest among members of the European Union, who already had
elevated the situation in Chechnya to a major topic at their
Helsinki meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A number of nations have expressed concern at the unsparing
nature of the Russian military thrust, which has killed countless
civilians, spurred an exodus of two-thirds of Grozny's 150,000
residents and forced 150,000 refugees across the Chechen border
into Ingushettia, according to the Red Cross.

QUALITY DAY CARE, EARLY, IS TIED TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE AS ADULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs 6th and 16th grafs to clarify; graphic has been held ) 
 (ATTN: N.C., Ala., N.Y.)  (dal) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Good early-childhood education has a powerful
influence that lasts into young adulthood, affecting everything
from reading and mathematics skills to the timing of childbearing,
researchers announced on Thursday, citing the first study ever to
track participants from infancy to age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Those who received high-quality day care consistently
outperformed their peers who did not on both cognitive and academic
tests, and also were more likely to attend college or hold
high-skill jobs, the researchers found. The program also helped
participants' parents, with teen-age mothers far more likely to
have completed high school after their babies received the
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called efficacy question, whether you can affect
development in the preschool years, is resoundingly answered in the
affirmative,'' Craig T. Ramey, director of the landmark study, said
at a news conference at the Department of Education. ``It has
become crystal clear that if you wait until age 3 or 4 you are
going to be dealing with a series of delays and deficits that will
put you in remedial programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, called the Abecedarian Project, involved 111 poor
African-American families in Chapel Hill, N.C., whose infants were
medically healthy but, demographically, at risk for failure in
school and beyond. Half the children were randomly assigned to
full-time day-care from infancy to age 5, while the others received
only nutritional supplements and some social work. They attended
comparable public schools from kindergarten on.
</P>
<P>
   With low adult-child ratios and a stable, professional staff,
the educational program consisted of a series of 200 simple games
focused on language development, starting with visual stimulus for
tiny infants and leading to scavenger hunts and mazes for older
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians and psychologists hope to use the barrage of new
data to persuade Congress and the states to broaden access to care
for poor families, particularly those on welfare, and to improve
conditions and curriculum in the current cadre of day-care centers.
The announcement comes amid increased attention to the issue, with
a group of experts scheduled to meet here next week to applaud
France's universal preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most child care in America is borderline lousy and, at best,
safe but not developmentally stimulating,'' said Michael H. Levine,
who oversees early childhood development projects for Carnegie
Corp. in New York. ``Whether or not there's a government solution
to providing high-quality care for all working families or not,
there certainly needs to be a more balanced responsibility for
responding to this research.''
</P>
<P>
   Abecedarian _ the word, echoing the ABCs, means novice learner _
found that children in the intensive educational program were more
successful than their peers by virtually every measure:
</P>
<P>
   _ 35 percent of those in the day-care program attended a
four-year college before their 21st birthday, compared with 14
percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
   _ At age 21, twice as many of the day-care graduates _ 40
percent _ were still in school; 65 percent of those who received
the intervention either had a good job or were in college, compared
with 40 percent of the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer of the participants in the child-care program had
children of their own by age 21; those who did became parents, on
average, past their 19th birthday, while the parents in the other
group were about 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ By age 15, twice as many of the children in the control group
had been placed in special education classes as their peers who
received the educational day care. Only 30 percent of the day-care
children had to repeat a grade in school, compared with 56 percent
of the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ While test scores were below average for both groups and
dropped over time, those in the child-care program kept an edge of
about 5 percentage points through age 21. The gap in IQ, however,
fell from about 17 points at age 3 to just 5 points by age 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ The study did not find significant differences in criminal
activity between the two groups, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most intensely studied group of children on
earth,'' Ramey said, noting that researchers collected about 10,000
pieces of data about each child each year _ everything from viruses
and bacteria in their respiratory systems to their participation in
organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey, now a professor of psychology, pediatrics and
neurobiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and his
colleagues at the University of North Carolina, have already
published nearly 300 academic papers based on the Abecedarian
Project, and plan additional peer-reviewed journal articles in the
coming months based on the new data. They also hope to continue
tracking the participants to age 28 or 29. The research has been
financed by the Department of Education and the State of North
Carolina, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The Abecedarian results echo results of several similar studies
that indicate educational day care improves academic achievement
and social behaviors. It is the first program that began with
infants _ aged 6 weeks to 4 months _ and followed them to
adulthood, and shows more significant gaps at age 21 than a similar
project, based in Michigan, that began with developmentally
disadvantaged children aged 3 or 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important is that it's not just any child care,
that it is high-quality early care and intervention,'' said Augusta
S. Kappner, president of Bank Street College of Education in New
York, who recently toured France with a group of 15 educators to
study that country's program of universal free preschool. ``What is
high quality? Usually you're talking about the really important
factors, such as the qualifications of the staff, the constancy of
the staff, the quality of the curriculum, group size, parent
participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abecedarian Project, based at the Frank Porter Graham Child
Development Center in Chapel Hill, had staff with qualifications
akin to public-school teachers, and virtually no turnover. Ratios
ranged from 1 to 3 to 1 to 7 depending on the children's ages.
</P>
<P>
   The learning games, such as waving a scarf over an infant until
he grabs it, or leading a toddler to identify like items among
several pieces of silverware, are integrated into a high-stimulus
day of art projects and playground visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the learning games happen during mealtimes, they
happen during diapering, they happen when you're going outdoors,''
explained Joseph Sparling, co-author of the curriculum, which was
published in two books. ``You could hardly distinguish them from
good adult-child interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Abecedarian cost the equivalent of $11,000 per child per year in
today's dollars, but researchers said similar results could likely
be accomplished for less, since there were extra expenses
associated with being a demonstration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that we can't afford this is absolutely bogus _
we get what we pay for,'' Ramey said. ``We're the richest country
on the face of the earth, we're the richest we've ever been. We're
not No. 1 in the world in education, in health care, in social
services.''  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SOBEL-ISRAEL-THEATER (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli theater writer,
Yehoshua Sobol, 60, a former director of the Haifa Theater, looks
back on an earlier era of theater in Israel. His plays includes ``A
Palestinian Girl'' and ``The Jerusalem Syndrome.'' Today he is
concerned that a depressing commercialism has overtaken the Israeli
theatrical scene. By Deborah Sontag. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOAN-OF-ARC-VIDEO (Undated) _ No particular reason comes to
mind, but on film and video there is a resurgent call for the
French peasant girl with, in the words of one critic in 1929, ``a
face supernaturally illumined by faith, with lips parched through
excitement and with a pair of eyes that see Heaven opening before
them.'' This is how he described the uplifted visage of Maria
(sometimes called Renee) Falconetti as Joan of Arc in Carl Theodor
Dreyer's silent classic ``The Passion of Saint Joan,'' released in
1928 and by far the most interesting of three titles about the Maid
of Orleans to be seen this fall. ``The Passion'' is to be released
on tape by Home Vision and on a fine DVD from the Criterion
Collection on Nov. 9. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CRAVEN-FILMS (Undated) _ From his cringingly inexpert yet
profitable debut with ``The Last House on the Left'' (1972), the
story of a Manson-like family of killers and the vengeance that is
wreaked upon them, through the imaginatively sinister and
profitable ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984), which established
the teen-age horror movie genre, and on to the witty and profitable
``Scream'' (1996) and ``Scream 2'' (1997), the second amusingly
deconstructing the first, Wes Craven could always be counted on to
spill an audience-pleasing ocean of blood. This was a source of no
small amount of frustration for him over the years, as producers
and studios ruled him out of consideration for projects merely
because of the images his name conjured up. But fortunately for
him, the success that so long pigeonholed him eventually sprang
him. Craven's new movie, ``Music of the Heart,'' which opens
Friday, stars Ms. Cheryl Streep as a music teacher in East Harlem.
It is based on a true story, is chock-full of feet-on-the-ground
characters and has heart and grit and genuine warmth. By Jame
Malanowski. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAME-EDNA-THEATER (New York) _ Dame Edna Everage, the Melbourne
housewife, social anthropologist, talk-show host, investigative
journalist and self-styled megastar, has clearly outgrown the
control of her mentor, Barry Humphries. He's the Australian wizard
who, as a young actor and writer, created the character for a
Melbourne revue in 1955 and has been at her side ever since. The
extent to which this gloriously opinionated, mauve-haired golem has
taken over Humphries is now nakedly apparent in ``Dame Edna: The
Royal Tour'' at the Booth Theater on Broadway. By Vincent Canby.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTALVO-DANCE (Creteil, France) _ With close to 20 years'
experience as a choreographer, Jose Montalvo is hardly a novice,
yet for a long time this tall simpatico Frenchman of Spanish
descent was known _ when he was known at all _ as a peripheral
artist more interested in experimentation than fame. Then he
created ``Paradis,'' a delightful multimedia, multicultural collage
of a work. After that, everything was different. Since its premiere
in March 1997, ``Paradis'' has been performed almost 200 times _
that's about once every four days _ in France and on tour in
Europe, the Far East and Latin America. Now the 60-minute work is
traveling to New York for eight performances at the Joyce Theater
starting on Tuesday as part of the New Europe '99 Festival. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TENORS-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a generation Luciano Pavarotti
thrilled and amused us; Placido Domingo evoked undying admiration.
Jose Carreras gave us early hope, but unwise career decisions,
choices made long before a serious and unrelated illness, left him
with fame, money and a ravaged voice. Opera in general sharpens our
nerve endings, sometimes to the point of hysteria. Tenors, for
better and worse, drive us crazy. We need a couple of big ones. So
audiences and a music business operatives are now taking a hard
look at three new tenors, Roberto Alagna of Italy, Marcelo Alvarez
and, most recently, Jose Cura, both from Argentina. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIC-ORGAN (Paris) _ Anyone familiar with organ music would
recognize the name. Aristide Cavaille-Coll (pronounced
cah-vah-yea-COLL) developed the ``symphonic'' organ in France and
died 100 years ago this month. The instruments he left behind could
fill vast spaces with sound as varied and powerful as a symphony
orchestra's, and they inspired composers from Cesar Franck, Camille
Saint-Saens, Charles-Marie Widor and Louis Vierne to Marcel Dupre
and Olivier Messiaen to play and write a dramatically expressive
kind of music for the instrument that pipe organs had never been
capable of before. By Craig R. Whitney. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOME-STUDIOS-RECORDINGS (subslug) (Undated) _ Since 1991, F.M.
Cornog in an upstairs room of his Summit N.J., home, has been
writing songs, recording them and releasing them under the moniker
East River Pipe. Every day, instead of going to work in an office
or factory, or, for that matter, a recording studio _ he goes to
this room and fiddles around and lays down ideas until he has
enough material for an album. East River Pipe's fourth and most
recent album, ``The Gasoline Age,'' released on the independent
label Merge, is a dreamy, Springsteenish meditation on suburban car
culture. By Karen Schoemer. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-MUSEUM (Jerusalem) _ It is never easy building a major
art museum from scratch, but Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of
Jerusalem, has good reason to crow. In less than four decades, he
has seen the Israel Museum evolve from an improbable fantasy into a
world-class institution whose collection now consists of some
500,000 objects _ roughly five times as many as the National
Gallery of Art in Washington. By Deborah Solomon. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POTTERS (Undated) _ Over the last 400 years, the
innovative potters of Puebla, a town east of Mexico City, have done
what potters do best: they have taken dazzling designs from the
ceramics of other cultures and reproduced them. Then, to mark them
as Mexican, they have added images of a cactus here, a parrot
there. The story of how Spanish potters succeeded in transforming
the traditional terra cotta ceramics in Mexico is the little known
story that is revealed in ``Talavera Poblana: Four Centuries of a
Mexican Ceramic Tradition,'' an exhibition at the Americas Society
Art Gallery, in Manhattan, through Dec. 12. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SENSATION-ART (New York) _ New art has rarely had as many
reluctant champions as ``Sensation,'' the exhibition of work by
young English artists from the collection of Charles Saatchi, the
English advertising executive, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
People both inside and outside the art world have been defending to
the death the exhibition's right to be seen in a public museum,
while turning up their noses at the art it contains or dismissing
it wholesale. By Roberta Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TSCHUMI-ARCH (New York) _ Alfred Lerner Hall, the new student
center at Columbia University, will plunge some baby boomer alumni
into a cool nostalgic bath. The architect, Bernard Tschumi, has
long made a touchstone of the events of 68: the student uprisings
that for many epitomize the turmoil of the 1960s. Columbia
University's architecture school was one of the epicenters of those
events. Today, the school is run by Tschumi, an architect whose
sensibility was formed by the Paris edition of those
demonstrations. No practicing architect of his generation has
identified himself more closely with the anarchic energies of that
era. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CORWIN-RADIO (Undated) _ For more than 60 years, Norman Corwin's
radio dramas about the human condition and the state of the planet
_ America, in particular _ have helped shape the public perception
of who we are and what we're doing here. Through war and peace,
Corwin opened his microphone to big thoughts and the common man:
freedom, loyalty, courage, fear, despair, triumph. For nine years
at CBS _ 1938 to 1947 _ he presided over national catharsis at the
radio console. And now, with the last 1,000 years to look back on,
Corwin has come up with ``Memos to a New Millennium,'' a half-hour
script he calls a meditation for radio. Underwritten by the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it will be distributed
nationally at year's end by Public Radio International. By Charles
Strum. (Moved).

DOCTOR AT SOUTH POLE RECEIVED BREAST CANCER ADVICE VIA E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (See also SOUTHPOLE-RESCUER) 
(DW) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerri L. Nielsen, the doctor who developed breast cancer while
trapped at the South Pole by winter weather, diagnosed her illness
and treated herself with the help of a cancer specialist in
Indianapolis who guided her via video-conferencing and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   An account of Dr. Nielsen's treatment while at the South Pole
was published Thursday in The Indianapolis Star. The article was
based on interviews with her specialist, Dr. Kathy Miller, that
began last August.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller and the Indiana University Cancer Center offered the
newspaper the information on the condition that it not be published
until Dr. Nielsen gave her permission. Dr. Miller has refused to be
interviewed by other publications, and Dr. Nielsen has declined any
interviews, citing privacy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the published report, Dr. Nielsen, 47, was admitted
to the Indianapolis center on Sunday, a day after being airlifted
out of the South Pole. She remained at the hospital under Dr.
Miller's care until Wednesday. Dr. Nielsen's treatment and
condition were not described in detail. But Dr. Miller said the
tumor, like most breast cancers, appeared to have originated in a
milk duct.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail quoted in the newspaper article, Dr. Miller also
called the cancer ``aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nielsen, the only doctor for a crew of 41 at the
Amundsen-Scott polar research station, first found a lump in her
breast in late May or early June. She had had a normal mammogram a
year earlier, and initially thought the lump was a cyst. But it
grew, and she e-mailed a doctor friend in her home state, Ohio,
asking him to find a cancer specialist to provide long-distance
advice. Dr. Miller was recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miller's first advice was that Dr. Nielsen should be flown
out of Antarctica. But that was impossible, because extreme cold
and darkness kept planes from landing. Knowing that in 1961 a
Soviet doctor at the South Pole had removed his own appendix, Dr.
Miller and colleagues then considered the idea of Dr. Nielsen's
operating on herself. But they decided she would not be able to do
an extensive enough operation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation, which runs the research
station, briefly considered having a surgeon parachute in, said Dr.
Karl Erb, director of the foundation's Polar Programs. But he said
last summer that the idea was abandoned for three reasons: the
situation did not seem that urgent, the station was not set up for
surgery, and a surgeon jumping in might be lost in the darkness,
high winds and temperatures colder than 100 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, doctors used video-conferencing to talk Dr. Nielsen
through biopsies, which she performed by inserting a needle into
her breast to draw out cells that could be stained and examined
under a microscope. A video camera was used to transmit images of
the cells to experts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In July, directed by Dr. Miller, with whom she exchanged e-mail
almost every day, Dr. Nielsen began to give herself hormonal
treatment and chemotherapy, which shrank the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But this month the National Science Foundation sent planes to
the South Pole several weeks ahead of its usual schedule, saying
Dr. Nielsen's doctors had urged that she be flown out as soon as
possible. On Saturday an Air National Guard plane was able to
evacuate Dr. Nielsen.

 &HT;    In postseason, nobody better than Rivera
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It blew up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones walked. Brian Jordan singled and so did Ryan
Klesko. Next up was Andruw Jones, who finished the kill by slashing
a three-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   It all came down quickly in the ninth inning on July 16 in the
Bronx. Jones' second home run of the night sent the New York
Yankees _ and more specifically, Mariano Rivera _ to a 10-7 loss
after they had been leading by a run.
</P>
<P>
   The day is worth recalling, not just because the Yankees are
seeing the Braves again this weekend. That afternoon at Yankee
Stadium also marked the last time Rivera, New York's superb closer,
blew a save. It was his most calamitous inning of the year. Since
then, he has remained the most consistent player in pinstripes,
allowing just one run since that day and absolutely nothing since
July 21.
</P>
<P>
   As the World Series begins this weekend, fans will hear much
about Chuck Knoblauch's psyche, Derek Jeter's cachet, Paul
O'Neill's severity, David Cone's bionic arm. Save the last word for
Rivera, because he usually has it.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, thus far, have dodged the Astros' Billy Wagner and
coped with the Mets' Armando Benitez, but this series pits them
against the game's best closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he has been so automatic,'' left-hander Andy Pettitte
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the beating by the Braves, Rivera went on to post a
major-league high 45 saves, the last 22 of them without incident.
He posted a career-low 1.83 ERA while allowing just five of 22
inherited runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jinx him or anything,'' Pettitte said, ``but
he has been special.''
</P>
<P>
   Never more than in the postseason. With a couple of saves and a
victory against Boston in the ALCS, Rivera comes to Turner Field
with a string of 21 1/3 scoreless postseason innings. His October
ERA is 0.42, the lowest of any pitcher in major-league history with
a minimum of 30 innings. And he didn't close until two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first got the job in 1997 (after John Wetteland's
departure), it is a little different when there is nobody behind
you,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``Somebody cuts the safety net out
from under you, and you realize that when the ball gets by you, the
game is over. It took him time.''
</P>
<P>
   The telling period came in early 1998. Rivera allowed a home run
to Cleveland's Sandy Alomar in the eighth inning of Game 4 of the
1997 AL Division Series, allowing the Indians to tie the game, turn
the series around and eventually win in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he came back the next spring, and (pitching coach) Mel
(Stottlemyre) and I made sure we talked about the home run and made
sure it didn't keep him from being the aggressive guy that made him
really good,'' Torre said. ``I think where the growing has come
from was probably from September of 1998, when he had discovered
with Mel's help, the movement on the fastball, instead of just
rearing back and throwing the four-seamer and thinking strikeout,
strikeout, strikeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera still throws the 97-mph fastball, but his 52 strikeouts
this season _ half as many as Braves' closer John Rocker _ reflects
his new reliance on the induced groundout. He has thrown fewer
pitches and has been available to pitch more often. Rivera was able
pitch six games in a row in one period this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's personality also is the opposite of the Braves' closer.
Yankee Stadium rocks to Metallica's ``Enter Sandman'' when Rivera
walks in from the bullpen, but he didn't choose the song and
doesn't particularly like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not cocky,'' he said earlier this month. ``I don't have a
big head. That's not me. I just love to help the team in the best
way I can do it. And that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been plenty.

 &HT;    O'Leary tinkering to try to jump-start Jackets
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary says he has made it
clear to the players he is far from satisfied with their recent
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Despite remaining in the Top 10, the Yellow Jackets have fallen
into a turnover and penalty slump on offense, and remain in a
season-long tackling slump on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're playing our best football,'' O'Leary said.
``We're basically sitting back and not reacting to the ball _ in
all three phases of the game. I just don't see us at that same
level of crispness we're used to playing at.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the shake-up O'Leary had indicated for his football
squad might better be described as a tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, which is ranked No. 8 but has been shaken by two
tougher-than-expected wins over ACC bottom-feeders North Carolina
and Duke, returned to practice Thursday after being out for fall
break.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets (5-1, 3-1 ACC) have this weekend off before
hosting North Carolina State, and O'Leary said the bye week could
not have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Players) re-charged their batteries and coaches re-charged
their batteries,'' O'Leary said. ``That's the nature of (being at)
midseason.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is a time for some tinkering, and in a surprising move,
O'Leary has switched All-ACC free safety Travares Tillman, who
missed the past two games with a back injury, to the
boundary-cornerback position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hesitant about moving at first. I would have to
learn a whole new position with just five games left in my college
career,'' said Tillman said, who played some at cornerback as a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I practiced pretty well today, and I have to help the team
anyway I can. In a way, it probably will help me out with (NFL)
scouts because they'll see me in more man-to-man coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory Collins, the highly regarded freshman who had backed
Tillman at safety before pulling a leg muscle, lined up with the
first team at the other cornerback position.
</P>
<P>
   That left freshman Jeremy Muyres, who played well in the absence
of Tillman and Collins, at free safety and Chris Young at strong
safety. Jamara Clark, Troy Tolbert and Marvious Hester will have
time to reclaim starting cornerback berths, but O'Leary is set on
playing Tillman, Muyres and Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the three guys in there who have proven they
deserve to be in there,'' O'Leary said. ``I'll take the next best
one and (at the cornerback opposite Tillman). I'm just trying to
mix it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Nick Rogers has moved back to outside linebacker,
while Guenter Kryszon, who had started at defensive tackle moves
out to end opposite freshman sensation Greg Gathers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Edwards and Felipe Claybrooks, former starters at
linebacker and defensive end, respectively, will still see a lot of
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving Nick to linebacker gives us a lot more flexibility,''
O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the move that will probably excite Tech fans most
is the probability that freshman tailback Sidney Ford, who led the
state in rushing last year at Pepperell High in Rome with 2,595
yards and scored 34 touchdowns, will have to forgo a redshirt
season.
</P>
<P>
   With starting tailbacks Phillip Rogers and Joe Burns out for the
season with injuries, the Jackets cannot afford such a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go with what you need to win with,'' O'Leary said.
``Sidney understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its losses and miscues, the offense remains the
nation's best, averaging 517 yards per game. And Heisman Trohy
candidate Joe Hamilton leads the NCAA in passing efficiency, while
the Dez White-Kelly Campbell receiving duo has 60 catches and eight
TDs. ``As long as we keep making big plays (with) our receiving
corps, we'll be able to score points,'' he said.

 &HT;    Turnovers a big plus for Dogs' defense
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's defense has taken its share of knocks
this year, on the field from opponents and off the field from
critics.
</P>
<P>
   But lost in the pile of yardage allowed and the close shaves
against supposedly outmanned teams is the ability of the defense to
fulfill coach Jim Donnan's most clearly stated mandate for the
season: Create more turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's game against pass-happy Kentucky, the
Bulldogs lead the SEC with 15 interceptions, have recovered five
fumbles and are No. 1 in the nation in turnover margin at plus-2
per game. That they are giving up an average of 348 yards per game
_ the third-highest total in the league _ seems less important to
Donnan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with our whole defensive philosophy,'' he said.
``What we said we were looking for was to create more turnovers,
take better care of the ball and have more snaps (on offense).
We've been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to three players. Cornerbacks Cory
Robinson and Jamie Henderson are tied for the team lead and are
third nationally with five interceptions each, and linebacker
Kendrell Bell has three interceptions and caused three fumbles.
Cornerback Jeff Harris and defensive tackle Richard Seymour also
have interceptions and fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, under coach Hal Mumme, bring to Athens the SEC's
most prolific passing offense (311 ypg) and the league's top-rated
quarterback, sophomore Dusty Bonner of Valdosta. The Bulldogs,
while opportunistic in the secondary, have proven vulnerable to
good passing teams. They are giving up 255.5 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's still very correctable,'' said Kevin Ramsey,
Georgia's defensive coordinator and secondary coach. ``It's not
about ability; it's not about one guy being faster than the other.
A lot of it has to do with technique, and we're working on that. If
we can cut down the mental errors, we'll see what kind of defensive
team we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ramsey, the Bulldogs are playing a more aggressive defense
that emphasizes pressuring the passer and playing man-to-man
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When it works, it's great. When it doesn't, it can result in big
plays for opponents. Georgia has given up 16 plays that gained 26
or more yards. Last week Vanderbilt had pass plays of 31, 41 and 58
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new aggressive defense, you're going to take some
risks,'' Robinson said. ``Sometimes, you're going to stump your
toe; sometimes, you're going to make a big play. It's not like
somebody's put up a bunch of points on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is giving up 19.2 points per game. The most was 37 to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played more man coverage, and we've been burned deep on
some plays,'' Donnan said. ``But we've committed to a pressure
defense. We've had a lot of lost-yardage plays (37-113),
particularly against the run, and we had more sacks last week
(three) than we've had, and we've forced some turnovers. ... Hey,
Deion Sanders gets beaten sometimes.''

<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ The call about the lady with the lump in her
breast first came to the New York Air National Guard's 109th
Airlift Wing in June.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know she was a doctor at that point, just a lady
working for the National Science Foundation, stuck on the South
Pole, and their answer, regarding the possibility of bringing her
out, was no.
</P>
<P>
   Summer in New York _ yeah, they have summer in Schenectady, Col.
Ed Fleming, the vice commander of the 109th and the man who planned
the rescue, will joke _ is winter at the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The day the call came in the weather at the Pole was minus 118
Farenheit. At that temperature, fuel starts to jell. There was also
no runway _ rather, no skiway, as the jets are equipped with skis _
and winter at the Pole means perpetual night. An Air Force plane
made a medical drop to the doctor, Jerri Nielsen, and she took the
extraordinary step of treating herself with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, as the weather in the Pole was warming, Fleming
was told that due to a change in Dr. Nielsen's treatment she had to
be taken out of the Pole by Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a team headed by Air Operations Officer Lt. Col.
Brian D. Gomula, who has had 10 seasons at the Pole, Fleming made
plans. He dispatched two LC-130 Hercules jets, equipped with both
skis and wheels, which give the 109th Airlift Wing the ability to
do something the 109th maintains no one else in the world can do:
land at the Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming set up a schedule which allowed his crews to sleep. He
warned his people of an adrenalin rush from ``having the world
watching'' which might impair judgment. A rescue was made in 22
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was one factor, however, which Fleming, an easy going
fellow who listens to Borodin on his office computer and who did
his doctorate dissertation on Human Factors Error in a Cue and
Symbol Saturated Environment, did not consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never allow a rescue to become an accounting exercise,''
Fleming says. ``You have a crew of six going to rescue one, people
will always go, `Is that worth it?' We will go in for three, two,
or one. I have two sons, we all have loved ones. If anything
happened to them we'd want people to make every effort to rescue
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a line you don't often see on a resume: ``300 Lives
saved,'' though being a modest and meticulous guy, Fleming, 51,
will call to amend that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually 293 lives saved,'' Fleming says, having checked.
``Pilots round things off. I don't want to sound too grandiose.''
</P>
<P>
   His career, nonetheless, has been impressive. Ten years in the
Air Force; 20 years in the Air National Guard, much of as commander
of the 106th Operations Group, a rescue unit on Long Island. There
has been tragedy _ a helicopter under Fleming's command went down
in 1991 and one man died. There has been triumph _ Fleming's
15-hour rescue of a sailor in '95 set the world endurance
helicopter rescue record. In that rescue Fleming was flying the
HH-60G Pavehawk, which, like all of the helicopters he has flown,
requires in-flight refueling from a tanker plane. To do this, the
pilot has to land a probe in a 27-inch wide target.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're eight hours out to sea, with a rotating wing that has
two hours of fuel, and you get so you have to live with that,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Liam Fleming did not grow up crazy with the desire to
fly, by the way. The son of a telephone foreman and a schoolteacher
in Buffalo, he majored in Chinese History at State University of
New York at Buffalo and planed a career in rehabilitation therapy.
Ask him how he ended up in the Air Force and his answer is
succinct: ``The draft,'' he says, meaning the war in Vietnam was
raging, and by enlisting he had some choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force trains Fleming in air rescue, which, he feels, is
not so removed from rehab. With the 31st Air Force Rescue Squad in
the Philippines, he flew Charles Lindbergh, after Lindberg had been
lost for 10 days in the jungle of Mindanao, in 1972. He piloted the
last active World War Two Japanese soldier, Lt. Hiroo Onoda, off
Lubang Island in 1974. Regrettably, he does not even remember
anything about the last active Japanese soldier.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, remember the rescue of the Ukrainian sailor in
December of '94. The sailor's ship, a freighter called the Salvador
Allende, had gone down in a storm 750 miles from shore with a crew
of 31. Only two would survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured if we had three tankers we could do it,'' Fleming
says. ``When we got out there, there was this guy in the water,
clinging to a wood cargo pallet, and maybe 60 life rafts around
him. Freighters, other aircraft, had thrown down rafts, but no one
had been able to get near him. We lowered one of my swimmers, you
should have his name, Doc Dougherty. The guy couldn't see, he'd
been blinded by the sun. He'd been in the water two days and given
up hope. Getting back was kind of scary. These aircraft aren't
really made for 15 hours. We had no relief tubes, the noise level
was so bad I couldn't hear. In the 13th hour we couldn't find our
tanker. That's when we had the most doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   His memories of the sailor? ``He was ecstatic,'' Fleming says.
``He writes me every Christmas and thanks us for getting him out.
He always sends a picture of his wife and two daughters.''

FISHING GEAR MAKERS BECOME A PRIZE CATCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Ill., Okla., Iowa, Wis., Mich., Texas, Ind., Ala.,
Va.)   (af)  
 By KATE MURPHY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like toy and hardware makers before them, small manufacturers of
fishing gear are being acquired by aggressive competitors looking
to build economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   The sports-fishing equipment industry has long been the province
of labor-of-love specialty companies _ supplying, say, just rubber
bait for catching walleye in the Great Lakes region. Although
several chief executives still answer their phones with a ``Howdy
do!,'' economic reality applies even to fishing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't survive in this business working out of your garage
anymore,'' said William H. Wilson, chief executive of Pradco Inc.,
a privately held company in Fort Smith, Ark., which owns 11 popular
brands of fishing lures, including Smithwick and Quik-Hit, many of
them acquired in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Steve C. Greer, chief financial officer of the United States
division of the Rapala Normark Corp. of Finland, another maker of
fishing lures, said ``product distribution is driven by the major
marts and big-box sports chains who don't want to talk to you
unless you can supply a range of products in large volume.''
Analysts say mass-market retailers and a handful of equally
demanding cataloguers sell 75 percent of fishing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the industry _ encompassing lures, rods, reels, line
and other accessories _ were estimated at $1.9 billion in the
United States in 1998, and close to $3 billion worldwide. ``It's a
lot of little stuff that makes up a very big market,'' said Tom B.
Doyle, vice president of information and research at the National
Sporting Goods Association in Mount Prospect, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Rapala, with $106.6 million in sales _ nearly half in the United
States _ went public late last year on the Helsinki Stock Exchange
and used part of the proceeds to buy a competitor, Storm
Manufacturing Inc. of Norman, Okla., for $13.2 million in January.
After 59 years as a closely held family business specializing in
hand-carved balsa wood lures, Rapala has ``moved into acquisition
mode,'' Greer said, to increase market share and capture ``that all
important peg space at Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Pure Fishing, a privately held company in Spirit
Lake, Iowa, has bought out several tackle manufacturers, including
the rod manufacturer Fenwick in 1988 and, since 1995, the reel
maker Abu Garcia, the Red Wolf line of fishing accessories and
Coleman Family Fishing. Pure Fishing is known for its Berkley brand
of bait and fishing lines that was started in 1937 by the father of
the current chief executive, Tom Bedell.
</P>
<P>
   Also growing by acquisition are two other industry leaders, the
Zebco Corp. of Tulsa, Okla., and Johnson Worldwide Associates of
Sturtevant, Wis., which also produces other outdoor equipment and
is majority-owned by Samuel Johnson, the chairman of S.C. Johnson &AMP;
Son, the household products company, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-level players like the Mason Tackle Co. of Otisville, Mich.,
and the Castaway Rod Co. of Conroe, Texas, have also been buying
competitors. Typical is Mason's recent purchase of the Hildebrant
Corp., a Logansport, Ind., company that is more than 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   It is better to buy existing brands than to create new ones,
because ``customers in this market tend to be extremely loyal to
the old names,'' said Jeff Pontius, president of Zebco, a division
of the Brunswick Corp. in Lake Forest, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much consolidation it's hard to keep track who
belongs to who anymore,'' said Deborah Johnson, managing editor of
Fishing Tackle Retailer, a trade magazine published in Montgomery,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the industry's trade organization, the American
Sportsfishing Association based in Alexandria, Va., has declined to
450 members from 600 members in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the number of products out there has remained pretty much
the same,'' indicating that the decline results almost entirely
from acquisitions, said Mike Hayden, president and chief executive
of the association.
</P>
<P>
   But consolidation is only one step in modernizing the tackle
industry. Fishing is a seasonal sport, and the required gear varies
by region and fish species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex category to manage once you enter the
broader market,'' said Bedell of Pure Fishing, which invested $4.5
million three years ago in a computerized inventory system and
warehouse. ``Before we were just like most everybody else in this
business, writing out all the orders by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure Fishing and others are also pouring money into research and
development _ building huge aquariums, for example, to test how
fish respond to new products.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing product lines and updating technology, tackle
companies are not only in a better position to serve the likes of
Wal-Mart. The efforts also help them enter the almost untapped
export market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our read is that the U.S. market is essentially flat, and we
need to look elsewhere to increase profits,'' particularly in
recreational fishing hot spots in Asia, Australia and South
America, said Pontius of Zebco, which has expanded its
international operations 33 percent in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Pure Fishing has set up divisions in 11 countries
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, at Pradco, said this industry was ``kind of behind''
others in globalization and consolidation. ``It's probably because
we spend so much time fishing,'' he said.

HOUSE SENDS CLINTON ANOTHER SPENDING BILL HE'S SURE TO VETO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second straight day, the House of
Representatives on Thursday approved and sent President Clinton a
spending bill he is sure to veto.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, providing $14 billion for the Interior Department and
cultural programs in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, was
adopted on a largely party-line vote of 225-200.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was the 12th of 13 spending bills to go through
Congress. Through a bit of parliamentary magic, the last bill _ for
the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services _
is to be tied to a new version of a vetoed measure providing money
for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Once that package, which was still being worked on Thursday
night, is completed, Republican leaders plan to add an
across-the-board cut of about 1 percent in spending for all
government programs for which Congress controls the annual
financing. That will enable Republicans to say they are abiding by
the party's recently adopted principle that no money raised in
Social Security taxes should be tapped for other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The final package is sure to be vetoed. The president opposes
across-the-board spending cuts. Congress also rejected his request
for money to pay for 100,000 new teachers in the nation's public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the Interior Department measure, Clinton objects to several
provisions that he maintains would damage the environment. These
are some of those provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ It would overturn part of an 1872 mining law and allow
unrestricted dumping of mining wastes on public land.
</P>
<P>
   _ It would allow, at least temporarily, petroleum companies to
continue to pay below-market royalties on oil they take from public
land.
</P>
<P>
   _ It would automatically extend grazing permits on national
land, regardless of whether environmental impact studies had been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   _ It would override a ruling this year by a federal judge that
timber cannot be cut in national forests at the expense of wildlife
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure includes less money than the president
requested for buying park land and for financing the National
Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the House voted, 215 to 213, to send Clinton a
spending bill for the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice
that the president also plans to veto, this one largely on the
ground that it does not provide the money he sought for more
community police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of approval Thursday for the Interior Department bill
was also well short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a
veto.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the
Appropriations Committee, called the Interior Department bill
``dead on arrival'' when it reaches the White House, and no one
took issue with that point.
</P>
<P>
   The aspects of the bill that the president opposes on
environmental grounds were added by the Senate, and the House
sponsors of the legislation made no effort to defend them.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and
Related Agencies, Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, said he had tried
unsuccessfully to get the objectionable features dropped in the
conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember we have a two-house system here,''
Regula said. ``There has to be some degree of negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Zach Wamp of Tennessee, argued that it
was too late in the year to pick small fights. ``We're focusing on
a few narrow problems,'' he said, ``and on Oct. 21 we need to get
beyond them.''

SENATORS AGAIN VOTES TO OUTLAW SOME LATE-TERM ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the federal budget unresolved and time on the
congressional clock running out, the U.S. Senate spent a second
full day dueling over abortion Thursday, setting the stage for an
explosive fight on the issue in next year's congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate fate of a Republican bill outlawing some late-term
abortions was determined long before it was approved Thursday
night, with President Clinton vowing to veto it as he has twice
before. But as they debated the legislation, senators in both
parties made it clear a full range of abortion issues will not fade
before the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a big issue in the year 2000 race,'' said
Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California. ``When you're
thinking of picking up five seats in the United States Senate, it
could be a deciding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Democrats accused Republicans of wasting time on the
issue to appeal to the party's conservative voters, a Democratic
member held a vote on the Supreme Court decision that legalized
abortion. In asking the Senate to vote on its support for Roe v.
Wade, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said he was building a record of
abortion-rights supporters to use in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which 48 Republicans opposed, said the 1973
Supreme Court decision to uphold Roe v. Wade was ``an appropriate
decision and secures an important constitutional right and such a
decision should not be overturned.'' After the ballots were cast,
Harkin hailed the widespread Republican opposition as a political
pot of gold, saying it ``lifted the veil of moderation that a lot
of Republicans were hiding behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear what the true agenda of the anti-choice
members ... really is...They want to criminalize choice,'' Harkin
said. ``I think every woman in this country ought to know what is
at stake as we go into next year's elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is campaigning for president, also
saw political capital in the debate, issuing a swift response to
the proceedings Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Gore said the
debate should ``serve as a wakeup call to all Americans as to what
is truly at stake in this election.'' Without a presidential veto,
the ban on late-term abortions would become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I will always, always defend a woman's right to
choose,'' Gore's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's so-called ``sense of the Senate'' resolution on Roe v.
Wade passed by a razor thin margin, with all 45 Democrats, except
Senators John Breaux of Louisiana and Harry Reid of Nevada, voting
in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Republicans _ including several Northeast moderates,
Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan M. Collins of Maine, John H.
Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ also
voted to pass the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The actual legislation at stake, sponsored by Senator Rick
Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania, passed by a larger
margin, 63 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   The same legislation, which would ban some types of late-term
abortions, passed twice before, and twice before the president
vetoed it. Few were surprised that Thursday's vote count was almost
exactly the same as the vote the year before, despite Santorum's
efforts to distance the late-term abortion provision from the
fundamental debate over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Santorum, the bill would have banned late-term
abortion in cases where a fetus has left the mother's uterus almost
entirely, what critics call a ``partial birth'' abortion. Other
forms of abortion would not have been addressed, he said,
dismissing critics' argument that the late-term abortion ban was a
move toward revoking all abortion rights. ``We made it very clear
we're not talking any other form of abortion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To some conservatives with higher political aspirations, that
view was insufficient. Senator Bob Smith, an Independent from New
Hampshire who is running for president, spent hours on the Senate
floor passionately denouncing abortion and inviting any woman with
an unwanted pregnancy to call his Senate office for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stabbing a baby in the back of the head is murder,
infanticide,'' Smith said. ``How many Beethovens have we killed?
How many great baseball players? How many entertainers? We'll never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Clinton set to veto the measure, it was the Roe v. Wade
vote that drew the most attention, with Democrats claiming it was a
``first-ever'' referendum on the Supreme Court case.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Senate has voted on abortion issues reflective of
Roe v. Wade three times in the past _ most recently in 1983, when
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican from Utah, proposed a
constitutional amendment to overturn the court's ruling and send
the issue of abortion back to the states. Hatch, who is in his 22d
year as a senator, is running for president. So is Senator John S.
McCain, a Republican from Arizona who missed the vote on Roe v.
Wade because he was on the campaign trail.

 &HT;    Stine, Scieszka big with young readers
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Young readers with a sense of humor and a love of
the frightful have reason to rejoice this week: Two of America's
most popular authors of kids' books are coming to town _ both for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Stine is best known for his scary ``Goosebumps'' series,
and Jon Scieszka is best known for putting a new spin on classic
tales (``The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs and The Stinky Cheese
Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales'').
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising that Thursday was Stine's first book-signing
trip to Dayton _ he grew up in Columbus, attended Ohio State
University and frequently comes back to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done Columbus a million times,'' Stine says. ``I still
have lots of cousins and friends there. I usually head right from
the airport to Rubino's Pizza on Main Street; New York pizza can't
compare.''
</P>
<P>
   He started writing short stories, joke books and comics for his
friends at the age of 9 and later edited Ohio State's humor
magazine. Stine, 56, will be listed in the Millennium Edition 2000
of the ``Guinness Book of World Records'' as the author of the
best-selling children's book series of all time. His ``Goosebumps''
series _ there are 90 books _ has sold more copies in seven years
than the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series combined in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is just to entertain kids and to make them love
reading,'' Stine says. ``It's worked very well. The millions of
books I've sold means that millions of kids are reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who work with kids agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``R.L. Stine was an immediate hit with boys,'' says Lisa Loftin,
a children's librarian for the Dayton and Montgomery County Public
Library. ``Until `Goosebumps,' most series targeted girls. These
appealed to boys and their delight in the scary and weird. And
series do encourage children to read.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The books I write have to be fantasies. The real world is a
pretty scary place for kids,'' Stine says. ``There are a lot of
twists and turns in my stories and they're very creepy but they
always have a happy ending. What's too scary is something that is
too real.''
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Nightmare House,'' includes 10 stories, each
illustrated by a different artist.
</P>
<P>
   He still incorporates humor in his books. ``Kids,'' he
believes,'' love to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Scieszka, who arrives this evening and was an elementary school
teacher for many years, couldn't agree more. It's his wacky sense
of humor that appeals to kids _ and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a wonderful sense of the fun and ridiculous, and
communicates it very well,'' says Loftin. ``Like everything else in
children, a sense of humor has to mature, and fractured fairy tales
are among the first jokes that kids ``get''.
</P>
<P>
   Scieszka (it rhymes with Fresca) says most humor is ``messing
around with your perception of the way the world is put together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what kids are doing all the time so they love to play
around with it,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The books he produces with best friend, illustrator Lane Smith,
are funny in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our books play around with the conventions of being books. We
mess up the way things should be: The dedication page is upside
down, we mess up the title page, the narrator.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs,'' for example, the
story is told from the wolf's perspective. The book has just been
rereleased in a 10th anniversary edition.
</P>
<P>
   Scieszka, 45, grew up in Flint, Mich., with five brothers (he
says he's the second-oldest and the nicest), and thought about
being a writer ever since his mom first read him Dr. Seuss' ``Green
Eggs and Ham'' and Ruth Krauss' ``The Carrot Seed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's All Greek To Me'' (Viking, $13.99) is the newest in the
Scieszka/Smith Time Warp Trio books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought time travel was kind of corny, but I love
history and that made me think: What if you could walk around with
King Arthur or hang out with Blackbeard?'' Scieszka says. ``Lately
we've expanded that notion to ask what it would be like to go into
one of your favorite books and meet up with Winnie the Pooh or the
Headless Horseman?''
</P>
<P>
   The Time Warp books will be turned into an animated television
series by WGBH-TV in Boston in 2001. ``It's All Greek to Me'' ends
with a list of Greek gods and goddesses and instructions for making
Orpheus's lyre or Zeus' thunderbolt (``1. Cut cardboard into the
shape of a thunderbolt. 2) Cover with aluminum foil. 3) Destroy all
monsters. Amaze your friends.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been a teacher, I take every opportunity to provide the
knowledge, but I try not to lecture them with it or make it so holy
they run away screaming,'' concludes Scieszka. ``Lane and I try to
reward the reader for looking closer and questioning.''

executive of Commonwealth Edison, with a 2,600-year-old Egyptian
mummy casket in his Chicago office. In an industry best known for
its colorless, mealy-mouthed chief executives, Rowe has made

mountain bikes, infringes on the firm's trademarks by using its

alarmingly still during the adaptation of the 1977 movie hit. And

435-pound bench press, a 40 yard dash time of 4.38 seconds, his 766

Greyhound bus station. Though he was never adopted, the 5-4,
187-pound 22-year-old has found a home here in the mountains of

Ka has become relatively common on the streets of Europe and Latin
America, it is not destined to be sold here, where the faint demand

COCA-COLA EARNINGS SLID 11.4% IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a performance that indicated improving sales but not better
profits, Coca-Cola Co. said Thursday that its third-quarter
earnings fell 11.4 percent but that revenue rose 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net income of $787 million, or 32 cents a
diluted share, compared with $888 million, or 36 cents a share, in
the quarter a year earlier. That quarter, plagued by volume
declines stemming from the Russian economic crisis, continued
sluggishness in Japan and other disappointments around the globe,
was the start of a decline that the soft-drink giant has struggled
to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Coca-Cola to earn 32 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings. In September, Coke said its earnings would drop to 33
cents a share or less, thus failing to meet the estimates of 36
cents at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 9 percent, to $5.2 billion, the company said. At
the same time, costs rose, including a 16 percent jump in Coke's
selling, administrative and general expenses. Part of that increase
came from efforts to market products in Europe after a recall there
in June that was the biggest in the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on after-tax earnings in the quarter was 2 to 3 cents
a share. Second-quarter earnings also lost 2 to 3 cents a share
because of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Volume worldwide, measured in cases sold, rose 3.5 percent,
though about one point of that growth came from Cadbury Schweppes
brands that Coke acquired in July. The company had forecast an
increase of 2 percent, so its volume results were slightly better
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had awaited this particular earnings report eagerly to
determine if Coca-Cola's fortunes had begun to improve; on
Thursday, they had mixed reactions. ``These aren't exactly heroic
numbers, but they sure look better than the first half of the
year,'' said Jennifer Solomon, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Branca, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said, ``It's the
fifth consecutive quarter of lower operating profits at Coke, and
that certainly suggests that things have not yet begun to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the company's chairman and chief executive, M.
Douglas Ivester, said: ``This past year has not been what the
company's share owners or its management, most especially me, want
or expect. Both our volume and profit results and our stock price
have disappointed us all, even recognizing the difficult
circumstances.''

   He added, however, that he was ``optimistic about the long-term
outlook for the global economy, and thus our ability to deliver on
our stated long-term volume and earnings objectives.''

   Share of Coca-Cola rose $1.5625 on Thursday, to $54.3125.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where Coke bottlers, like their rivals at
Pepsi, raised prices at the retail level earlier this year, volume
rose 2 percent, compared with 4 percent in the period a year
earlier. But concentrate shipments fell 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan provided a surprising 10 percent increase in volume, the
first rise in several quarters. The company attributed the
improvement to a variety of factors, including its marketing,
vending acquisitions, an introduction of a new half-liter plastic
bottle and the ``slightly improving economic conditions,'' as well
as the growth from Cadbury brands.
</P>
<P>
   Volume also rose 10 percent in Germany, another big Coca-Cola
market. ``Germany benefited from a very strong month of September
resulting from integrated media and marketing programs focused on
building long-term brand equity of both Coca-Cola and Fanta,'' the
company said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   Currency exchange rates cost the company 6 percent in earnings.
And equity income, or the income Coke derives from investments in
its bottlers, was just $11 million, compared with $51 million in
the third quarter a year ago. In the last nine months, equity loss
has totaled $72 million, in contrast to income of $103 million in
the same period last year.

 &HT;    Intensity a lifelong trait for Rocker
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She calls it fearless confidence. And she saw what it
could do long before the name of her son, John Rocker, became a
household word after he barked back at New York baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   The volatile and outspoken Braves closer was 15 when he and his
mother, Judy Rocker, walked their golden retriever Casey down their
street in Macon and a Rottweiler burst from a neighbor's garage and
tore into Casey's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, John reached down, lifted Casey over his
head and started yelling at the Rottweiler. A neighbor intervened
and drove the Rottweiler off by spraying him with a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker survived that incident unscathed _ just as he did
last weekend in New York, where the Braves were trying to fight to
a fifth World Series berth this decade. But back then, he had yet
to learn whether the bark or the bite is worse. He still does.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has gone from being one of the most surprising baseball
stories of the season _ stepping in for the injured Kerry
Ligtenberg and becoming one of the dominant closers in the game _
to being one of the loudest. Going against the usual Braves grain,
Rocker spoke out against Mets fans for their taunts and their
jeers. ``To hell with Mets fans,'' he said, and he called them
``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   For three days during the National League Championship Series,
Rocker heard it and felt it from Mets fans. They booed him
constantly, threw objects at him as he ran from the bullpen and
read headlines referring to him as the ``Mouth of the South,''
``King of Trash Talk'' and ``Punk Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   He managed to thrive in that environment, pitching in all three
games there and allowing only two runs on John Olerud's
bases-loaded chopper. That he did so wasn't exactly a surprise to
his mother, who knows quite a bit about her son's quick temper,
where he got it and how it works.
</P>
<P>
   During Rocker's sophomore year at First Presbyterian Day School,
he was pitching in the championship game of an all-star tournament
in Dalton. Rocker, who had been saved for the championship game and
was wild because of it, started the game by throwing 12 balls in a
row. He heard about it from the opponents' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker looked over and yelled back. Then he struck out the side
and proceeded to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think it's anger or hostility that drives him,''
Judy Rocker said. ``He's a very intense person, a perfectionist. He
came out of the womb like that. There's something about John, a
fearless confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's in his actions and his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a haircut,'' Judy Rocker said, ``when you really
don't want to know if he doesn't like it, don't ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Rocker never said anything to her son about keeping his
mouth shut during the Mets series. In her eyes, he's a man now and
is free to make his own decisions. Plus, she remembers him coming
home from New York last summer distraught over hearing fans chant
what they would do to players' children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me proud for him to stand up and say what he believes
in, but in a way it concerns me,'' Judy said. ``I don't think he
understands there are people out there who will really hurt him.
John doesn't always know how to pick his battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the negative attention, and some discouragement from
his manager, Rocker doesn't think he made a mistake by lashing out
at the Mets fans. But he's not planning another round of verbal
shenanigans for the Yankees fans when he heads back to New York
during the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat the Mets 9 of 12 times (in the regular season), and
their fans still didn't give us any respect,'' Rocker said.
``Yankee fans aren't like that. I'm just glad my mother wasn't
there to hear what they said about her.''
</P>
<P>
   They heard enough talk back home.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends of the Rocker family were at a meeting in Macon
last week in which somebody got to gabbing about how John Rocker
got his hot head from his father, Jake. One of Judy Rocker's
closest friends laughed and then interrupted:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Jake and Judy Rocker for 25 years,'' the friend
said. ``And it's not Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Rocker taught school for more than 10 years. She remembers
one incident with a seventh-grader who stood up in class and talked
back to her. The student said his parents would sue her if she made
him go to the office to get paddled. She took him out in the hall
and gave him a piece of her mind. She had no more trouble from him.
She was 25 then, the age her son turned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how my life has changed,'' Judy said. ``It's no fun for
it to be in the national media that a whole city hates you. I told
John, `You'll have to hit a bunch of brick walls. That's the only
way I've ever learned. If Dad and I say cool your jets, I don't
know how much that would mean. I'd still do things my way.'''
</P>
<P>
   His way for now is to suck it up and move on, not asking for any
apologies and not giving any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that don't like me are the people I don't want to
like me,'' Rocker said. ``People who throw D-cell batteries at you
and water bottles and cups of beer _ being a fan favorite for that
kind of person doesn't interest me. ... If you like me, good. If
you don't, `Oh, well. I didn't know you before all this
happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the last day of his first regular season as the Braves'
closer, John Rocker walked out of Turner Field about an hour after
the game. His parents were waiting to take a family picture for the
church directory in Macon. Judy Rocker had made arrangements for
her brother-in-law to shoot a picture of them in the media parking
lot. But a pack of fans came running for Rocker in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Rocker caught herself saying, tight-lipped, ``Do y'all
mind?'' But she softened after her son pulled away in his car and a
young girl handed a T-shirt to Jake Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the summer, Braves relievers made up T-shirts in

KASHMIRIS TO PRESS CASE, TRYING NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN

   UNITED NATIONS _ As the United Nations drew up plans in recent
weeks to take over East Timor, a lonely band of Kashmiris was in
the shadows, trying to make a case that their region, like East
Timor, is still unfinished business for the United Nations and
deserves more international attention.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century ago, on April 28, 1948, a Security
Council resolution called for a plebiscite on the territory's
future after India and Pakistan both claimed Kashmir, an autonomous
kingdom left in limbo by the British when their colonial rule
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The plebiscite was never held, and therefore the United Nations
does not recognize Indian occupation of the Kashmir valley and
Jammu, or the Pakistani occupation of the rest of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say the two cases illustrate the role of outside
political pressure in determining the extent of U.N. involvement in
regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a politician who has to get up every day in Parliament to
answer questions,'' the Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy,
said in an interview, ``I can tell you that constant pressure has
been for 20 years on East Timor _ highly organized, articulate
lobby groups, churches. I can go from one year to the next and
never hear a peep about Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Timorese, 890,000 predominantly Christian people in
Islamic Indonesia, have been buttressed by support from Portugal,
the country that abandoned them in 1974 and opened the way to an
Indonesian invasion, as well as from the Roman Catholic Church and
various leftist and international human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmiris in India _ more than four million Muslims in a
predominantly Hindu country _ do not have an effective
international support network outside their own community abroad.
They find it hard, therefore, to muster political or diplomatic
leverage against India, which calls their rebellion an Islamic war
created and sustained by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Although some international human rights groups have made
clandestine visits to Kashmir and issued reports of atrocities,
such organizations are not permitted to monitor the territory
openly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Indian officials took two spokesmen for the Kashmiri
cause, Umar Farooq and Abbas Ansari of the All Parties' Freedom
Conference, off a flight from New Delhi to New York, where they
wanted to make their case to world leaders who were attending the
U.N. General Assembly. Their passports were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kashmiris have not always been barred from leaving
India, this year only the founder of the All Parties' Freedom
Conference, Abdul Gani Lone, 73, was permitted to go, ostensibly
for medical treatment for a heart condition. His Indian passport
was endorsed for travel solely to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, said in an interview
here that he knew nothing of the Kashmiris' travel problems and
could not explain why they were prohibited from traveling to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   India has more than 500,000 troops and paramilitaries in the
Kashmir valley. Independent outsiders estimate that up to 20,000
people have been killed since an independence movement armed itself
10 years ago, after what Kashmiri leaders call decades of political
and economic suppression by successive Congress Party governments
in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress now defeated decisively in a national election and
a strengthened Bharatiya Janata Party returned to power, Kashmiris
may find that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee will have a freer
hand in finding political solutions for Kashmir, a flash point for
war between India and Pakistan, said David L. Phillips, director of
the conflict resolution program at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said in an interview, however, that the world had less
leverage to bring to bear on India over Kashmir than on Indonesia
over East Timor. India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris need to look for
new ideas themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lone, the Kashmiri advocate, is a former member of the state
assembly but now rejects involvement in any form of Indian
politics. An election boycott last month led by his organization
was widely followed and raised questions in New Delhi about India's
policy to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``By refusing to take part in the election, voters in the
Srinagar constituency are trying to say something,'' The Times of
India said in an editorial. ``The state and union governments must
try and understand what that message is.''  &QL;

Chino and move their herd of 2,000 cows to a farm 180 miles to the

Court in Manhattan, contending that Wong's Web site, featuring
mountain bikes, infringes on the firm's trademarks by using its
letters as part of the domain name. From a distance, it seems that
Wong stumbled into the path of a profit-seeking juggernaut. However
it turns out that a company set up by Wong's father has registered
dozens of domain names, many of them derived from the names of
investment banks. (Peter DaSilva/New York Times Photo)

22-year-old Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages banks to
make loans in low- and middle-income neighborhoods, has been the

187-pound 22-year-old has found a home here in the mountains of

A LESSON FROM UNLIKELY SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just after noon and three men stood near
second base, fielding ground balls. I didn't travel to Yankee
Stadium to see them, but as I watched them throw Thursday, I found
myself playing a game of word association.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Derek Jeter: Graceful.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Billy Crystal: Funny.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch: Duck. Survive. Run, fool. Now.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I didn't come here to make fun of Knoblauch. For once,
he looked at ease as he threw with Jeter and Crystal (who is a
friend of Joe Torre's). If I could make it so fans weren't required
to wear fatigues and helmets when Knoblauch throws, I would do it.
That's my mission. To make things right. That's why I'm here,
trying to determine, finally, if the Red Sox should be here, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Yankees flew to Atlanta for Game 1 of the
World Series. They were supposed to be here, playing Game 7 of the
American League Championship Series with the Red Sox. Everyone
knows that. I was reading the paper the other day and saw that some
scrub wrote, ``I'll be in the Bronx'' to see Roger Clemens-Pedro
Martinez II. Many Sox fans still say the umpires took the series
away from them. Nomar Garciaparra refused to say the Yankees are
the better team. Dan Duquette said if the Sox had caught the ball,
they'd still be playing.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with these people?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a point,'' said Jim Leyritz, a current Yankee and
former Sox. ``When I played for the Padres, we said the same thing
when the Yankees swept us in (last year's) World Series. If we
hadn't made a couple mistakes, they wouldn't have swept us. Boston
was right there in a couple of those games.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not good enough. There are some New Englanders who
still can't recall anything from November 1986 because they haven't
gotten over what happened a month earlier. We can't have that now.
We must find the truth. We are going to do one of Torre's favorite
things: we are going to tinker and speculate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, baseball is second-guessing,'' Torre said Thursday.
``Not only with the media, but with the fans.'' The Yankee manager
explained that everyone believes they have the ability to manage,
and that makes guesswork even more intense.
</P>
<P>
   So let's put justice in motion.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Rick Reed makes the correct call in the 10th inning.
Jose Offerman is safe at second base. Eventually there is a
showdown between Garciaparra and Mariano Rivera, who hasn't been
scored on since July. Torre loves to play games of managerial
chess, but when Rivera is in the game, he said Thursday, ``The
managing stops.'' That's how good Rivera is. He has a cut fastball
that, according to the Sox' Mike Stanley, ``you can only hope to
pop it up'' when the thing is working.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Garciaparra breaks open a 3-3 game by pulling a
high cutter down the left-field line. The Yankees are so shocked
that they react slowly, so Offerman scores easily and John Valentin
scores _ unexpectedly _ from first. The Sox lead, 5-3. Rod Beck
allows a leadoff homer to Bernie Williams in the bottom of the
inning. (Sorry, some things I just can't change. Did you see that
fastball?) After some sweating, Sox win, 5-4. They lead the series,
1-0. A few thousand Yankees dissidents chant, ``Nomar's Better.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the Sox get a brilliant pitching performance
from Ramon Martinez, but waste it by stranding 13 runners. Jason
Varitek and Troy O'Leary just miss home runs. The series is tied,
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   After an off day, Pedro and Roger are ready for their matchup in
Boston. Most of the pregame hype reminds you of boxing. It's
fitting, because the only way Clemens would have won is if shady
boxing judge Eugenia Williams declared him the champion. The Sox
win, 13-1. They lead the series, 2-1. Clemens pitched only two
innings and allowed five runs. Torre says afterward that he will
not change his rotation and plans to go with Clemens if there is a
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Astute baseball fans will see that there is a lie in the
previous paragraph, a lie that will change the series. Here's a
hint: Earlier, Torre said that he ``would never'' take Knoblauch
out of the game for a defensive replacement. In Game 5 he took
Knoblauch, who had 26 errors in the regular season, out of the game
for a defensive replacement. If you double-talk like that on a
baseball field, you're Manager of the Year. If you double-talk like
that with your spouse, you're paying alimony.)
</P>
<P>
   After Game 4, fans and sportscasters offer to buy Tim Tschida a
drink. There are articles in both Boston newspapers about the good
umpires, the ones you don't hear about because of the bombastic
Richie Phillips. Tschida is praised because he made a tough _ and
correct _ call at second involving Offerman. Remarkably, the
Yankees pitch to Garciaparra with first base open and he hits a
two-run homer to put the Sox ahead, 4-3, the eventual final.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-1 Sox lead and a Game 5 shocker: Clemens starts against Kent
Mercker. He doesn't look great, but he goes seven, gives the Yankee
starters an extra day of rest and, most important, wins.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6: Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez over Ramon Martinez in a
well-played, 3-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   And then there would have been Thursday night. Pedro vs. either
David Cone or Andy Pettitte, working on three days rest. It's hard
to go against the best pitcher in baseball. But it's also hard to
go against a team with two World Series titles in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, in the last few days many Sox fans have done to the
Yankees what they accuse others of doing to their team. They have
dismissed them, saying they are really not that good. Truth is, the
Yankees handle the basics so well that they should wear khakis
instead of pinstripes. When you handle details like that, it's hard
for bad umpiring to send you home.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I had to come to the Bronx to figure that out. Sometimes
you get lessons from the most unlikely sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two best teams are playing right now,'' a tall man
observed Thursday. The man's name is Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Never thought I'd say this, but Darryl Strawberry is right.

SURVEY SAYS 78.7 MILLION OWN STOCKS IN UNITED STATES

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of stock owners in the nation soared to 78.7 million
people early this year, 85 percent more than in 1983 when the long
bull market was getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Among households, 48.2 percent now own stock directly or through
mutual funds, more than double the 19 percent with such a stake in
1983, according to a survey by Investment Company Institute and the
Securities Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased interest in stock investing, a majority of
stockholders said they neither bought nor sold any securities last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly one in two households own equities today, and the vast
majority of these investors have a buy-and-hold investment
strategy,'' said Marc Lackritz, president of the securities
association.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on 4,842 responses of randomly selected
households in January and February, show just how much Americans
are relying on stocks to reach retirement and other financial
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which described stock ownership by income, assets,
location, sex and ethnic group, also found that investors who were
trading online in 1998 were considerably more affluent than people
who were trading the old-fashioned way through a broker. This
highly desirable group is the target of the big brokerage firms,
which are rushing to provide online service to compete with online
discount brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The report uses for comparison stock ownership figures for 1983
that were published by the New York Stock Exchange. While the
portion of stock owners has grown 85 percent in that time, the
population has grown far more slowly, 15.6 percent, between 1983
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The New York Times calculated that American
households had more assets invested in stocks than at any time in
at least half a century and had more value in stocks than in their
homes for the first time since the 1960s, based on an analysis of
Federal Reserve data.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Thursday by the two trade associations found
that the typical stockholder is 47 and lives in a household with
annual income of $60,000 and total assets of $85,000. Most are
married college graduates; 53 percent have individual retirement
accounts and 80 percent have employer-sponsored pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more striking findings was how many stock fund
investors have multiple accounts. Twenty-two percent of people with
stock mutual funds own shares in seven or more stock funds, and 26
percent own four to six funds, suggesting they may have taken
diversification a little too far and created bookkeeping headaches
as well. Nineteen percent of fund investors hold just one fund, the
same percentage as hold two funds.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all surprising, however, was that holdings in stocks and
stock funds rise with age and household income. Median holdings of
those with incomes of $150,000 or more were $150,000, while those
earning less than $50,000 had holdings worth $20,000. The median is
the point where half a given group lies on one side, half on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that most stockholders had some seasoning,
though not necessarily by suffering through a real bear market.
Fifty-four percent bought their first stock before 1990, 28 percent
made their initial purchase during the first half of the decade and
only 18 percent jumped into equities since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have suggested that newcomers, despite telling
pollsters they were investing for the long haul, will panic and
bail out in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   And although many of the newcomers have traded actively, some
quite visibly for very short periods, only 45 percent of all
stockholders did any buying or selling during 1998 and of these,
buyers outnumbered sellers three to two, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 percent of stock trades were over the Internet, though
this share undoubtedly rose as electronic investing became
progressively easier and cheaper as the year progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical owner of equities is not a trader,'' said John
Rea, research director at the Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, the survey found that the South, not the
Northeast, has the biggest concentration of stock investors.
Thirty-three percent of stockholders live in the South, 26 percent
in the Midwest, 25 percent in the West and 16 percent in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although fewest in number, Northeastern equity owners tend to
be older, have more household financial assets and have a greater
ownership rate for individual stocks outside retirement plans than
other equity owners,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions to buy stocks are shared in 54 percent of households,
but men make them in 26 percent of households and women in 20
percent. Men are more likely than women or joint decision makers to
own individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 85 percent of stock-owning households own stock mutual
funds while only 54 percent own stocks directly, with 47 percent
owning only funds and 15 only individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-owning population is 90 percent white, 5 percent
black, 2 percent Asian, 5 percent Hispanic and 2 percent ``other,''
the overlap reflecting the fact that Hispanic people can be of any
race. Black investors favor funds over individual stocks, Asians
the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 48 percent of stockholders are baby
boomers, 28 percent are from the 55-to-74 age group, 19 percent are
members of Generation X _ the most aggressive investors in that a
greater portion of their portfolios are in equities _ and 5 percent
are 75 or older.

FEDERAL COURT RULES CITY MUST ALLOW KLAN RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal court ruled on Thursday night that the Ku
Klux Klan must be allowed to demonstrate in lower Manhattan this
weekend, saying that the city had violated the group's First
Amendment rights by refusing to permit the rally if Klan members
wore their traditional masks.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering that the protest could proceed Saturday afternoon, a
special two-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan
also elicited a promise from a top city lawyer that the Klan
members would not be arrested for wearing masks at the
demonstration, which is against state law.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing their ruling, the judges did not go as far as the
Klan had sought, which was to declare the city's antimask law
unconstitutional in all cases.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, city officials said they would file an appeal
on Friday morning with the Federal Court of Appeals in Manhattan,
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued a statement sharply critical of
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of the ideology extended from the
60s,'' Giuliani said. ``This ruling says people don't have to take
responsibility for what they say or what they do, even as they
support organizations that encourage anti-Semitism,
anti-Catholicism, racism and hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came after a hearing at which the two judges heard
testimony from two Klan officials. The leader or imperial wizard of
the group, the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, acknowledged
in court that his rallies often draw violent reactions from
counter-demonstrators, who throw bottles, rocks and other objects
at the Klan members.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom after the decision was issued, the Klan leader,
Jeffery Berry, said: ``The Constitution was there. The judges are
sworn to uphold the Constitution. And they done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city had argued in court that the mask law was intended not
to stifle unpopular speech but to enable the Police Department to
do its job at rallies where the potential for violence existed.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the reason for the city's appeal on Friday,
Michael D. Hess, the corporation counsel of New York City, cited
the violence seen at previous Klan rallies that Berry testified
about in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are faced with this type of violence,'' Hess said, it
was important for the police ``that the identity of every
individual be known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to discourage violence, and one way to discourage
violence is to know who you're faced with,'' he said. ``The court,
we feel, erred in saying that masks can be used because that takes
away from the Police Department's ability to identify people and
hold them responsible for their actions if there is violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judges, Harold Baer Jr. and Alvin K. Hellerstein, while
sympathizing with the department's predicament, said there had been
no testimony suggesting that the Klan members were likely to engage
in violence themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Supreme Court decisions that protect certain forms of
conduct or expression under the First Amendment, the judges said
they agreed with the Klan's position that the masks afforded the
group's members anonymity and protection from potential retaliation
in their home communities or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masks have a _ perhaps tortured is a good word to use _
history in the United States,'' Hellerstein said, ``creating fear,
and fear of physical violence on the part of one group of our
citizens, and creating the message of hate and spite and everything
that America does not stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, masks also reflect ``a fear of people who express
themselves in various parts of our society, including the society
of New York, that they may be subject to harm, both physical and
economic, if they are unmasked and their identities are known.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer quoted from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, saying, ``I
think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to
check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be
fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate
interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that
an immediate check is required to save the country.''

CONSULTING FIRMS OFFER EXTRA PERKS TO KEEP TALENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (dal) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Help wanted: prestigious firms, already offering six-figure
salaries, will now let employees take up to two months off each
year or get special access to Internet investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   This in essence is what the world's top consulting firms are
resorting to as they battle the E-commerce tide that is stealing
many of their best job candidates and employees, from college
campuses and even the corner office. In a range of initiatives just
under way, the firms are trying to hire and keep people by
emphasizing the advantages of a secure job while also replicating
some of the perquisites of a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   McKinsey &AMP; Co., which for years has had its pick of
business-school graduates, has decided to offer its associates
access to Internet start-up investments designed to mimic the
growth potential of stock in a new business. Among other options,
the plan could include letting the junior consultants buy stakes in
investment funds, possibly including venture-capital funds, that
would not normally be open to them, or buy stakes in a pool of
McKinsey clients that have given the firm equity instead of paying
cash, said Anil Kumar, a McKinsey director and one of the leaders
of (AT)McKinsey, its E-commerce practice. Details will be finalized
within two months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Management Consulting, meanwhile, is telling consultants
this week about new work rules under which Mercer will help them to
design a new business plan, and even leave the firm to launch it.
The rules will also allow consultants to take off up to two months
each year, to do anything from enrolling in a class to going
mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, it's been all the major consulting firms and all
the major investment banks going after the best and brightest,''
said Jim Down, vice chairman of Mercer. Now that E-commerce firms
have joined the fray, Down said, ``we certainly have lost some very
good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, turnover rates have risen at many large consulting
firms, including McKinsey. In September, George T. Shaheen, chief
executive of Andersen Consulting, the industry's largest firm, quit
to head up tiny Webvan Group, an Internet grocery in Foster City,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the firms are having to work much harder to
woo MBA's who now consider their heroes to be Amazon.com founder
Jeffrey Bezos and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang more so than titans
such as Jack Welch or Warren E. Buffet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems like it's the new gold rush,'' said Douglas
McCracken, managing director of the Americas for Deloitte
Consulting, which this week began an advertising campaign to
promote its month-old E-business unit, ``where everyone is going to
dot-com's expecting to get stock and get rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The new initiatives indicate just how attractive the start-ups
have become. Consultants for years have prided themselves on their
workaholic schedules, boasting about 14-hour days in far-away
cities. Now, to keep employees happy, Mercer is telling people to
take long vacations, with benefits but not pay, if they feel like
it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mercer is saying to employees who are interested in
one day starting their own company that it will help them plan, put
them in touch with venture capital firms, and perhaps even invest
in the business itself. The firm will also set up some consultants
with ``externships,'' one- or two-year assignments in outside
companies from which they conceivably might not return. ``It's a
big, big change,'' Down said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, McKinsey was long extremely wary of accepting
equity in any of its clients, lest it find itself so tied to one
company that a rival would not hire the firm for a different
assignment. Even as Bain &AMP; Co. made big profits after starting Bain
Capital, a private equity firm, in 1984, McKinsey partners shunned
such a move, concerned it could call their independence into
question. Bain says its two units do not share information.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past 18 months, McKinsey has accepted small stakes
in start-up companies that could not otherwise afford its fees.
That gives it an entree into the Internet world and makes it more
attractive to MBA's, Kumar said. Now the firm is considering
allowing its own associates to invest blindly in those equity
stakes. ``We don't want the best talent to feel they don't have a
vehicle to join in this wealth creation,'' Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Webber, a former McKinsey consultant and now president of
Aurora Advisors Inc., a New York firm, said, ``For McKinsey, these
are very radical moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The investments, even if blind, raise the prospect of
conflict-of-interest problems because consultants would assume that
the firm, and perhaps even them individually, owned a piece of any
start-up for which it had done work. That in turn could make rival
start-ups uncomfortable about hiring McKinsey.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said McKinsey was taking only small stakes in other
companies and that it planned to sell its shares as soon as
financially prudent. He also said consultants would not know which
start-ups they owned a piece of. ``We want to adhere to the highest
standards of professionalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the other major consulting firms also accept
equity stakes from small companies that lack the cash to pay the
industry's high fees.
</P>
<P>
   The firms hope that having a significant E-commerce practice
will allow them to hire and keep people who are interested in
technology and may one day decide to join a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Overton is the kind of candidate the firms are hoping to
woo. A 28-year-old student at Columbia Business School, she worked
for a high-tech investment firm before going back to school and
then spent last summer at an Internet company. Now she is applying
to Bain and McKinsey, while also trying to launch her own
E-commerce business and talking to other start-ups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always understood that the best students would want to
go to consulting, and there was no serious competitive industry,''
said Ms. Overton. Today, however, ``everyone is getting completely
intoxicated'' thinking about the Internet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is particularly evident at Harvard Business School,
where a single graduating class of 800 once included more than 300
consultants. In 1996, 35 percent of MBA's took such a job, compared
to just 16 percent who went into high technology or venture
capital, the school said. Last spring, the portion going into the
new fields doubled, to 32 percent, while the share of consultants
dipped to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the recruiting and retention battles should be kept
in perspective. Consulting is still the most popular job for
graduates of the top MBA programs, and the firms are growing,
causing them to hire more people than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Attrition ``has been rising, and it's related to e-commerce,''
Mercer's Down said. ``But we're not devastated or panicking.''

SENATE VOTES TO BAN A CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted 63-34 Thursday to ban a particular
kind of abortion procedure that its opponents call ``partial
birth,'' but fell slightly short of the votes that would be needed
to override President Clinton's expected veto.
</P>
<P>
   The passionate debate on the issue _ with graphic charts,
wrenching anecdotes and flashes of anger and emotion _ has become a
familiar Senate ritual, enacted many times since 1995. But the
Senate action was being closely watched as the first test of
strength on the divisive social and political issue in the 106th
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters had once hoped that last November's
elections would bring them the extra votes to prevail. But
Thursday's vote for the ban indicated _ if several absent senators
do not change their stands _ that its advocates had picked up only
one supporter since last year and would have 65 votes for an
eventual override. That is two votes shy of the 67 that would be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine Republicans and 14 Democrats voted for the ban, while
31 Democrats and three Republicans voted against it. Three senators
were absent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would outlaw a kind of abortion in which, according to
the bill's supporters, a fetus is partially delivered feet first.
An instrument is then inserted in the skull and the brain is
removed before the fetus is fully removed. The procedure is used in
the second and third trimester.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ban first passed in 1995 and was vetoed by Clinton,
abortion opponents have found that their focus on this particular
procedure has been a successful political strategy for advancing
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Various types of ``partial birth abortion'' bans have been
enacted in up to 30 states. But lower courts in two-thirds of those
states have either struck down the law or limited its
implementation. The issue is widely expected to reach the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in a statement, said that the bill ``contains
the same serious flaws'' as past measures and that Clinton will
veto it once again. The president has objected in the past that the
measure does not contain an exception to protect a woman's health.
The bill's advocates argue that such an abortion is never medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., led the fight for the ban. He said
this type of abortion ``is not like abortion, it is like
infanticide,'' adding, ``This is a baby that is all but born and
then killed.'' He also tried to put the ban in a broader context,
arguing that by allowing ``this kind of execution,'' the Senate was
sending a message to young people that ``violence is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., said: ``If people were sticking
scissors on the heads of puppies we would not abide it. In the name
of common decency and humanity, I implore my colleagues not to let
this happen to the young any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents called the bill unconstitutional and read letters from
doctors and physician groups saying such a law would tie the hands
of medical professionals in dealing with life- and
health-threatening pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in the Senate,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., ``a hundred of us and not one of us an obstetrician, not
one of us a gynecologist, deciding what procedures should or should
not be used, and under what circumstances, in a matter that should
be left to the medical profession, left to the families of this
country, left to loving moms and dads.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, told of a couple who learned they
were expecting a child with such abnormalities that it could die in
the womb. Should the government, she asked, bar the woman from an
abortion procedure ''that will protect her health and her future
fertility?''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, the chief sponsor of the ban, tried Thursday to pick
up the final votes for an override by altering the language of his
bill in response to a recent ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals that similar state laws in Arkansas, Iowa and Nebraska
were so vaguely and broadly written that they were
unconstitutional. Santorum defined the procedure as one used when
an ``intact living fetus'' is delivered ``partially outside of the
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Boxer argued that even with this language, the law would
still be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate, the two sides strove for the middle
ground and tried to make their opponents look extreme. Santorum
said those opposing him were really saying that abortion should be
performed ``at any time, any place, any manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said supporters of the ban were actually
intent on overturning Roe vs. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court
decision in 1973 that created a legal right to abortion. To make
that point, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, offered a non-binding
amendment voicing support for the 1973 decision, which narrowly
passed 51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which has twice overridden the president's veto on
this legislation, is expected to consider the ban next year.

<P>
   The number of Americans without health insurance rose last year
to its highest level in a decade. More than 44 million people _ 16
percent of the population _ lack coverage of any kind, according to
the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem is not limited to the poor. Despite a strong
economy and a low unemployment rate, more than 12 million Americans
in households with annual incomes of $50,000 or more are without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs exist to help the uninsured, but too few people
seem to be aware of them. One of the most ambitious efforts is the
Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, created by Congress
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides health insurance for children from working
families with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low
to afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D.-Mass., who was
co-author of the legislation creating the program, said that
``between CHIP and Medicaid, virtually no child in a low-wage
working family should be without health insurance.'' Yet, according
to the White House, about five million children who qualify for
these programs are not taking advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   To increase participation, President Clinton has started a
campaign to enroll children through their schools. More than 1,500
schools have agreed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are also being made to match uninsured adults with
medical services, because many people who qualify for programs like
Medicaid still struggling to navigate the health care labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest complaints I've received relates to how
difficult it is to find and apply for programs like Medicaid,''
said Rima Cohen, a vice president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association.
</P>
<P>
   To address the problem, she is developing a Web site to help
uninsured people in New York State _ at least those with access to
computers _ in determining their eligibility for public insurance
programs and to find low-cost medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rules vary widely from state to state, there is
little consistency in insurance coverage across the nation. But
some states have passed legislation to help the uninsured. In New
York, for example, health insurers doing business in the state are
required to sell individual insurance to anyone regardless of their
medical history.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers must also charge the same premiums to all customers in
a given area, regardless of health status, age, sex or occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Len Nichols, a health economist at the Urban Institute, a social
policy research organization in Washington, suggested that the
uninsured check with their state insurance departments to find
special programs for low-income workers. Community health centers
represent another important resource, he added, since they will not
turn away people without coverage. Public teaching hospitals can
also provide a haven where the uninsured can obtain both outpatient
and inpatient care. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nichols points to another useful strategy _ seeking clinical
care before medical conditions become serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason the uninsured problem is so hidden,'' he
said, ``is that the uninsured don't seek medical care until their
problems are much more severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many public hospitals are underfinanced and
overburdened by providing care to the poor, they represent one of
the few resources available to those who cannot afford to pay for
medical care. Some private hospitals, like Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York City, have also set up special programs to help
the uninsured determine their eligibility for Medicaid or other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies may provide an additional resource for
low-income Americans who cannot afford prescription drugs. Some
companies have special programs to provide free medication to
patients who meet specific income guidelines. Consumers can contact
the companies directly to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problem is not that people cannot afford
insurance, but that no insurer will cover them because of existing
medical conditions. In other words, while the purpose of insurance
is to spread the risk of high-cost diseases over a large
population, it fails to accomplish this goal if some patients are
excluded from coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Patients suffering from, say, asthma may be unable to buy
insurance at any price. To address the issue, 28 states have
created ``high-risk pools'' for people with serious health problems
who have been denied coverage from private insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The high-risk pools are not a panacea, since people in them may
have to pay substantially higher premiums than other consumers, but
the pools provide a crucial alternative for patients with serious
medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, since the pools serve less than 1 percent of the
uninsured population, many Americans still fall through the safety
net. And as some experts have noted, with so many people slipping
through the cracks, the net is becoming increasingly frayed.

GORE FACES UNDECIDED VOTERS IN FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore began a new adventure in
campaigning Thursday night, answering questions from undecided
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stood in the gymnasium at Dover Middle School and stayed
there for several hours, until the last of the 200 people in
attendance had finished grilling him. It was, aides said, a scene
reminiscent of the town hall meetings he used to hold in Tennessee
when he was first elected to Congress in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any of you who have any doubts about supporting me for
president, I want you to use this as an occasion to purge all
doubt,'' Gore said, half in jest, at the outset of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The people here politely queried Gore on several concerns:
prescription drugs, health insurance, missile defense, campaign
finance, special education, pornography on the Internet, the budget
surplus, and Gore's political legacy and morals, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Malizia, who voted for Bob Dole in the last election,
wanted to know if Gore would embarrass the country the way
President Clinton had with in the Monica Lewinsky episode. ``I
fully believe our country is in a mess,'' she said. ``One of the
things I need in a president is an honest man and a moral man and
I'm very disappointed in this president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would bring his own values to the office of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment that you feel, and I felt it
myself,'' Gore said. ``I think most people want to look to the
future, turn that page and move on. All I can do is tell you about
myself and tell you about my commitment to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked about his 29-year marriage to his wife, Tipper, and
about his mother and father and how they met. And he talked about
his respect for the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never betray it,'' Gore said. ``I'm in this because I
want to make a positive difference and I'm in this because I think
I can.'' Malizia said later she was impressed by the answer.
</P>
<P>
   For the forum, 2,800 undecided voters from Strafford County were
invited to attend, based on phone calls and canvassing that found
them unsure of who to support. All have a history of voting in past
Democratic primaries. About 20 Gore supporters were also invited. A
second open meeting is scheduled for Monday in Nashua; there is at
least one planned in every county in the state before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who said, `I'm with Al Gore all the way weren't
invited,' '' said Douglas Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jaron Arnold, 12, who attends the middle school, told Gore that
many of his friends like to go on the Internet, visit Web sites
with pornography, and print it out. ``How would you prevent that?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the school should be able to filter out inappropriate
sites from the computers. But in one of the evening's amusing
moments, the school's principal stood up to tell the vice president
that no student could access pornography in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went back to the student and discovered that his friends
were accessing the pornography from home computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents, you've got to pay attention to this. You would not
let your children go out in big city alone in the middle of the
night in a dark alley, would you?'' Gore asked. ``Of course not. If
that's your attitude, you should not let them go alone, unprotected
and unfiltered on the Internet. There are a lot of dark alleys and
red-light districts and free-fire zones and you must protect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he praised the Internet as a valuable resource, he also
said some material is inappropriate.

BANKING BILL STALLED OVER RULES TO ENCOURAGE BANKS TO MAKE LOANS TO
THE POOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a week of difficult negotiations between Sen.
Phil Gramm and President Clinton's top economic advisers over a
bill to overhaul the nation's financial system, it became evident
Thursday that there would be no new law unless an agreement can be
reached over the legislation's effect on rules that encourage banks
to make loans to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all week, Democrats and Republicans
appeared to be engaged in a political exercise Thursday fraught
with heavy symbolism over the effects of the legislation on the two
parties' traditional constituencies. At its core, some Republicans
want to ease the burdens on banks, while Democrats want to see
something in the legislation for minorities, farmers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the exercise so unusual is that there is overwhelming
support among both Democrats and Republicans for virtually all of
the substance of the legislation, which would repeal Depression-era
laws that have made it expensive and difficult for banks to enter
the securities and insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the effort by Gramm to limit the community lending
laws does not appear to have the support of the majority of the
banking community, which has profited handsomely from making loans
to the disadvantaged and underserved, but is based on the banking
chairman's view that the current law has led to unnecessary
excesses and burdens.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services measure, which was making great strides
in recent weeks after a 20-year struggle over its passage, stalled
Thursday when Gramm, R-Texas, failed to gain even a majority of his
Senate colleagues to support what he has said was a fair compromise
on the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law intended to encourage
extending credit to minorities, the disadvantaged and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   By a 10-10 vote, the senators on the conference committee
defeated an amendment by Gramm that was essentially the same as the
proposal the White House rejected Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The vote fell almost entirely on party lines. Sen. Richard
Shelby, R- Ala., joined the Democrats because he said the amendment
did not go far enough in relieving small banks from the burdens
imposed on them by the Community Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House rejected Gramm's proposal, Gramm responded
by saying it would not be so bad if there were no bill at all this
year because he was confident he would have a better one next year
after George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown men argue over periods and commas and clauses because
when you're talking about literally tens of billions of dollars, it
makes a difference,'' Gramm said. ``I hope the president will sign
our bill. But if he doesn't, we will have a new bill in 15 months.
I know who the president will be, and I believe it will be a
different bill.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last four days, Gramm, Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers and Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, have
talked for hours about whether the legislation should require that
banks expanding into new businesses maintain adequate lending
practices under the Community Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to break the impasse between Gramm and the White House,
other Republicans and Democrats Thursday began attempts at crafting
provisions on the act that would be able to both satisfy the White
House and garner enough moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs Thursday that Gramm's position on the
community lending had hardened and that it might be difficult to
revive the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the White House's insistence that the legislation not roll
back the Community Reinvestment Act, Gramm said: ``There's an old
saying where I come from _ don't take a hostage you're not willing
to shoot,'' Gramm said at an afternoon news conference. ``I don't
take hostages I'm not willing to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm made the same comment last year soon before he killed a
similar bill supported by the White House proposed by Sen. Alfonse
M. D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A passionate critic of the act, Gramm has opposed any effort to
expand it into new areas. The White House and Democrats in Congress
say that the financial legislation, with a bag of goodies for the
biggest and most powerful corporations in America, ought to at
least have something for the poor, and that at a minimum the price
for allowing banks to expand into the insurance and securities
business should be a requirement that those banks have satisfactory
ratings under the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks and insurers and securities firms will be very happy
with this legislation, they have done more than OK,'' said Rep.
Maxine Waters, D- Calif.. ``I don't understand why it is that we
have done nothing for the people, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats and lobbyists said that in opposing the
Community Reinvestment Act, Gramm was handing his opposition a
strong political argument in the coming election that the
Republican party is largely unsympathetic to the plight of the
disadvantaged, and minorities in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramm is the Democratic Party's single best unifier,'' one
longtime financial services lobbyist said.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle of the dispute between Gramm and the White
House are the three industries, which have tried for the last few
years to get legislation that would repeal the Glass-Steagall Act
and other laws that have limited the ability of banks, securities
companies and insurance firms from entering into one another's
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of a train wreck that would derail the legislation, a
parade of lobbyists from the banking, securities and insurance
industries who have championed the measure trooped to Capitol Hill
Tuesday to implore Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority
leader, and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, his counterpart in the
Senate, to put off any final votes by the conference committee
until an adequate agreement could be reached with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists emerged from the discussions hopeful that there
would be no final votes until a deal could be reached on the
Community Reinvestment Act. &QL;

BREEDERS' CUP NEEDS SECOND LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ It seems to happen this way as often as not: You have
the Breeders' Cup all figured out. Then they run the prep races.
</P>
<P>
   The past three weekends' major stakes at Santa Anita, at Belmont
Park in New York and Keeneland in Kentucky only muddied the waters
for fans looking ahead to the Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream
Park in Florida. In a few cases, the mud was real.
</P>
<P>
   Of the horses who'd been generally considered the leading U.S.
contenders in each of the eight Breeders' Cup races, six were
defeated in their final preps, one (the 2-year-old filly Chilukki)
won less impressively than expected, and another (the sprinter
Forestry) raised legitimate questions by staying in the barn.
</P>
<P>
   The result is widespread re-evaluation of the whole $13million
Breeders' Cup card. With apologies to Newsweek magazine, here's a
look at how the conventional wisdom has changed since the start of
the month. The races are listed in the order they'll be contested.
</P>
<P>
   Distaff Old conventional wisdom: 3-year-old Silverbulletday is a
superfilly, Banshee Breeze is the class of the older females, and
Keeper Hill just can't win anymore.
</P>
<P>
   New conventional wisdom: Losing to pacesetting 4-year-old
Beautiful Pleasure in the sloppy-track Beldame at Belmont Park
demonstrates Silverbulletday is worn out after 10 races this year
and beating her age group 11 times in a row, while Keeper Hill's
victory over Banshee Breeze makes her the now horse.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: Silverbulletday took the worst of the
racetrack at Belmont as Jerry Bailey rode her near the rail _ a
path other jockeys were avoiding in the big races on that soggy
day.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Fillies Old CW: Chilukki is the second coming of
Ruffian and will be the shortest-priced favorite on Breeders' Cup
day.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: Chilukki still might be the heaviest favorite but only
because the other races are wide open. She's winning more narrowly
as the distances increase, embarrassing allowance winner Abby Girl
at Santa Anita, and will be vulnerable against stronger-finishing
Surfside going 11/16 miles for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: Chilukki let up after taking the lead from
Abby Girl, a bit of mischief that's no surprise in a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Mile Old CW: If the Europeans aren't scared off by the Florida
climate, they'll be favored to win the mile turf race for the ninth
time in 15 runnings, while Californians will be in for their usual
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: Leading Euros Sendawar and Gold Away have dropped out.
The victory by Julio Canani-trained Silic in the Oak Tree Mile, the
soft-course third by Canani's Ladies Din at Keeneland, and an
unlucky disqualification by Neil Drysdale-trained Hawksley Hill in
Canada give the race a real western tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: Better use the next two weeks to examine
the Mile inside and out, reviewing every U.S. videotape and
consulting European analysis _ and then mark the ``all'' box in the
upset-prone opening race of the Breeders' Cup pick-six.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Old CW: Forestry has been resting contentedly in Bob
Baffert's barn since a swift victory at Saratoga in August,
watching other Sprint hopefuls beat each other up.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: Belmont Park record-setter Artax, romping Santa Anita
winner Lexicon and rusty Santa Anita runner-up Kona Gold have to be
sharper than a horse who's been off for 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: Fitness is never the pivotal factor in the
6-furlong Sprint, so you should concentrate on other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Filly and Mare Turf Old CW: All the long-sidelined Fiji needs is
one good prep and then it's off to defend her 1998 female turf
championship.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: Two losing preps later, the cautious Drysdale is under
pressure to run Fiji in the Breeders' Cup as a retirement sendoff.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Old CW: New York's More Than Ready is the second coming
of Easy Goer.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: He's another Easy Goer to this extent _ he won't win a
Breeders' Cup race, having been put away for the year, ``a little
tired'' after back-to-back losses, according to trainer Todd
Pletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: More Than Ready's western counterpart, Del
Mar Futurity winner Forest Camp, might be an even better bet now
that an educational second in the Norfolk has raised his odds.
</P>
<P>
   Turf Old CW: Dubai-owned European star Daylami is a world-beater
if he comes.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: He's coming, after some hemming and hawing.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: He's coming because his handlers are
unimpressed by the U.S. contingent, so if you like an American,
don't be discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Old CW: It's New York older horse Behrens vs. California
3-year-old General Challenge in a classic showdown.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: Behrens' Jockey Club Gold Cup loss to River Keen is
excusable because of the Belmont mud, but General Challenge
confirmed he can't win the close ones when fairy-tale Budroyale
defeated him in the Goodwood.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility: It's an open race in this year without a
superhorse, so it's best not to make up your mind too soon about
Behrens, General Challenge or anybody else. &QL;

<P>
   As baby boomers, we have had amazing fortune. A strong economy
has given many of us comfortable careers and the stock market has
made us more comfortable still. Many in our group are successful,
wealthy and not nearly done yet.
</P>
<P>
   But that sense of endless possibility is causing us to make a
familiar mistake. Although we are prescient enough to prepare for
our children's education and our retirement, we have the same
inability as past generations to contemplate our own deaths while
we're young. That means many of us are not preparing wills or doing
the other things that smooth the way for our heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomers are probably the best generation as far as
investing,'' said Stuart Kessler of Goldstein Golub Kessler, an
accounting firm in Manhattan, ``but in other areas of planning,
like wills, they are one of the least-equipped generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said boomers were also falling short in other areas.
They lack disability insurance, a durable power of attorney if they
become incapacitated, or even a simple letter of instruction _
telling survivors where, for example, to find the key to the
safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   I've bought disability insurance, but I lack the others _
including a will. I keep putting it off because it's not a
priority. Besides, if I die without a will, won't my wife end up
with everything anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Not true, Kessler said. In my state, Connecticut, assets held
solely in my name would be divided automatically among her and the
children. Generally, states divide the assets by giving the
surviving spouse a portion of the assets, often $50,000, then
splitting the remainder 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   New York and New Jersey do it that way; in Connecticut, the
spouse gets the first $100,000. When there are children of a
previous marriage involved, the formula is often adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   David M. English, a law professor at the University of Missouri
at Columbia, said 14 states, mostly in the Midwest and West, give
the surviving spouse 100 percent of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-50 split may sound benevolent, but my wife may need all the
money to keep the household running. Although the court would
appoint my wife to be the children's guardian, it may name someone
else, like a lawyer or a bank, to watch over their money until they
are 18. These guardians charge a fee for that service, which
includes making sure that money is handled appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the circumstances, Kessler said, some courts would
make the surviving parent pay for school, or the hiring of a nanny
while the parent worked, out of the parent's, not the child's,
share. Kessler recommends a will that leaves assets to the parent
and money in trust for the children, with the parent as the
trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Albert L. Sica, 37, of New York City, doesn't have a will, but
is seeing a lawyer about getting one. He always put it off, but now
that his children are 10 and 13, he recognizes the need to provide
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we needed to get a will, but it's not like we have $20
million in the bank,'' Sica said. ``It was not in the forefront of
our minds, but, God forbid, if my wife and I were to die, what
about the kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said that having to make decisions about the children
sometimes kept people from making a will. One reason ``is that they
can't agree on the guardians for the children'' if the parents die
together.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sabatino, assistant director of the American Bar
Association's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly, didn't
get a will until he and his wife were leaving for a trip overseas
many years ago, without their two children. The night before they
left, he said, they were in a lawyer's office signing documents.
The biggest point of discussion was who would take care of the
children. They decided on his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often don't start thinking about estate planning until
they have little kids and are about to travel,'' he said. ``Kids
are a great motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest motivator may be our own parents. ``Boomers think
they'll live forever,'' said Scott R. Severans of Severans &AMP;
Bennett, an Indianapolis law firm specializing in the elderly.
``But we will see a surge of boomers getting wills when they
encounter their parents' failure to plan and the mess it creates or
the relief, at a moment of crisis, that their parents have a
plan.''

USC ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR NEW ARENA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As previously reported, USC officials announced
plans Thursday to build a 12,000-seat campus-events center that
they expect to be completed by January, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is planned to be located across the street from the
campus, on the corner of Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard,
where a parking lot exists. But athletic director Mike Garrett said
a final decision on the location has not been made.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett has assured USC president Steven B. Sample that the
arena will cost under $70 million. Construction is expected to
begin this summer. Sample said ground will not be broken until 100
percent of the funds have been pledged.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed at least $12 million has been raised, but Garrett
said Thursday's announcement was the official kickoff to
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Sample could be a huge ally in fund-raising. Under his tenure,
USC has become the only university to secure three individual
donations of $100 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The arena) is substantially smaller than that,'' Sample said.
``It will be important to get a huge lead gift of $10-20 million.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's basketball coaches were elated by the announcement,
particularly women's coach Chris Gobrecht.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I feel?,'' Gobrecht said. ``How would Superman feel if
kryptonite never existed? To know we can never be stopped again is
an incredible feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a reason for the best players to come to USC, but it
will be a place to inspire great players and an appropriate place
to showcase their talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something to keep up with our cross-town rival. We
don't have to do something this hard to keep up with those guys.
It's something we know will put them to shame. Not that we're into
that.''
</P>
<P>
   USC has hired HNTB Sports Architecture, a company that
specializes in arena design, to begin developing architectural
specifications. An architect and contractor will be selected next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said an outside marketing firm would be hired to obtain
naming rights to the facility. USC has already met with GTE on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important project ever undertaken by the
athletic department,'' Garrett said. ``I believe some of us have
been waiting for 50 years for this.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, men's basketball coach Henry Bibby provided the best
moment of levity about the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be the first men's basketball coach in the
new arena,'' Bibby said. ``We hope. Right, Mike?''

MINISTER DECIDES TO END FAST OVER THIRD-WORLD DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His body so weak he could barely stand, a retired
minister from southwest Washington yesterday ended a 45-day hunger
strike he began in an effort to persuade Congress to forgive the
debts of third-world nations.
</P>
<P>
   Late yesterday afternoon, 71-year-old David Duncombe of White
Salmon, Wash., stood on the grounds of the Capitol and broke bread,
literally, with a group of his supporters. Later he intended to eat
a spoonful of rice. He expects it will take him several days before
he can eat a real meal.
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe will return to Washington state this weekend without
seeing the result he wanted: Congress passing a measure to forgive
an estimated $970 million owed by 40 impoverished countries.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers supporting the cause said they are optimistic that
they may yet eke out a victory in the waning weeks of this year's
congressional session. A variety of religious leaders, including
Pope John Paul II and the Revs. Billy Graham, Jesse Jackson and Pat
Robertson, have called for debt forgiveness as a way to honor the
biblical injunction to forgive debts every 50 years as part of a
celebration called Jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll pass it because it's a real window of
opportunity _ the year 2000, there are a lot of church groups
pushing this,'' said Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala. ``Anyone who
studies this issue for any amount of time comes to the conclusion
that it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe said that yesterday, when he could barely walk, he
decided it was time to start eating, rather than risk death. But he
counted some successes _ he met with the powerful House Majority
Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, for example, and came away believing the
House would vote on debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the feeling in the past few days that things are
really moving,'' Duncombe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, in my starvation, representing millions of faceless,
voiceless, powerless starving people, ten thousand of whom are
dying each day in the countries covered by this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous lawmakers joined Duncombe as he ended his fast and
praised his action.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the example of his own denial of the most basic element of
survival, he is reminding us that there are so many people ... who
every day have no choice,'' said Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the power within us to correct that. We are in the
richest nation in the history of the world ... and we give less per
capita than almost any other country in the world.''

USC'S STEELE SAYS NFL CAN WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Linebacker Markus Steele first drew comparisons to
Chris Claiborne when he arrived at USC two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a valid assessment is debatable, but Steele is
already answering the same questions Claiborne did last year about
his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL wouldn't be bad, but I figure I can help myself more
if I stay and get my degree,'' Steele said. ``It's crossed my mind
a lot, but I'm at the point where I won't leave. I'll be back for
another season. It's tempting, but I just got here and I want to
experience college life.''
</P>
<P>
   USC fans will breathe easy with those remarks, because they
won't have to go through another early departure a la Claiborne,
who became a top-10 draft pick last season after winning the Butkus
Award as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   It's only this week that the NFL and Steele became a serious
topic, partly because of his 18-tackle performance against Notre
Dame. Steele also had one of the game's big plays when he dived
through Notre Dame's line and forced quarterback Jarious Jackson to
fumble as the Irish tried to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over the top of two blockers and got the ball out,''
USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He continues to improve week after
week.''
</P>
<P>
   But not enough to leave for the NFL _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was to leave, I would have to be in the top 10,'' Steele
said.
</P>
<P>
   He's not there today, but his speed and size (6-foot-3, 220
pounds) make him attractive. He could probably even play strong
safety in the NFL because of his athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   It's one reason Steele leads USC with 59 tackles along with
three sacks, four pass deflections, one interception, three forced
fumbles, two fumble recoveries and a 46-yard fumble return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm doing a little better than I thought,'' Steele
said. ``I thought it would take longer to figure out our defensive
schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   USC linebackers coach Shawn Slocum said Steele's ability was
widely known, but he has impressed the coaches with his intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what kind of toughness he would have,'' Slocum
said. ``Last week he was tired, but he came back and caused a
fumble. He's a guy with the ability to make plays all over the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious analogy to Claiborne, Slocum believes Steele
is too different a player to make comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris didn't look fast, but he was fast,'' Slocum said.
``Markus is just plain fast. Markus tends to come off the edge and
slither through. Chris would just go through people.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele's speed might also be a weakness of sorts, six games into
his college career. He is so eager to follow the ball that he
sometimes forgets his assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to overrun a lot of plays,'' Steele said. ``The coaches
tell me to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe anyone would have to tell Steele to relax.
In person, he is so laid-back and mellow that when people meet him,
they rarely think he plays football.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure I play some sport but not football,'' Steele said.
``Some people say I'm too nice to play that kind of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele was actually a two-sport star at Chanel High in New
Bedford, Ohio. He played basketball against USC forward Sam Clancy,
who is also from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was athletic,'' Clancy said. ``He had good hops and was
very strong. I could tell he would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   He just didn't act like a typical football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have football mentality in every moment of my
life. It's something I can turn off and on,'' Steele said. ``I want
to be a regular student like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Before any one believes Steele is a wallflower, notice the
transformation when he discusses his love for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would like football. You can let a lot of anger and
frustration out on anything,'' Steele said. ``You get contact and
you don't have to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele was recruited by Ohio State and Michigan State, but his
high school grades were so poor he knew he couldn't attend a
four-year college. Instead, he called Pasadena City College and
asked for a game tape. While watching the tape, Steele was
intrigued by the opponent, Long Beach City College.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to attend Long Beach instead, and was soon touted as
the nation's top JC linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get far away from home,'' Steele said.
``California is where the best talent is.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele liked California so much, he decided early in his
freshman year that he wanted to go to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited Arizona State and Oregon, but I had my mind set I
would go to USC,'' Steele said. ``Ohio State called me again. But
you don't have to worry about the weather changing here. I did so
good here I thought I would stay. All I want to do is play here and
go to a major bowl game.''

KEY FIGURE IN CHILD-ABUSE CASE IS SPARED MORE PRISON TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The case that came to symbolize society's
shifting views on prosecuting child sexual abuse ended Thursday for
Cheryl Amirault LeFave after a judge agreed not to send her back to
the prison where she spent eight years for molesting children at
her family's day care center.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprisingly placid finale to a highly charged case, both
LeFave's lawyers and Middlesex County prosecutors agreed that she
should not return to prison in the wake of a failed bid for a new
trial on charges she sexually abused children at the Fells Acres
Day School in Malden, Mass., in the 1980s. Superior Court Judge
Paul Chernoff concurred and released her.
</P>
<P>
   While LeFave will not have to serve any more of an eight- to
20-year sentence, her freedom comes at a price. In a deal with
prosecutors designed to shield the now-grown victims, LeFave agreed
not to appear on television to talk about the case and she cannot
profit from her notoriety during her 10 years on probation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, LeFave, who has been free on appeal since 1995,
must drop her 15-year quest to overturn her conviction, a crusade
that ended in August when the state's highest court reinstated her
1987 conviction for child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult pill to swallow,'' LeFave said. ``I
gave up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   There was never any possibility that LeFave would admit guilt in
exchange for concessions from prosecutors, and her lawyers said
that issue was never up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave, and her mother, Violet Amirault, were convicted and
sentenced to eight to 20 years in prison on the molestation
charges. Violet Amirault died of cancer two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave's brother, Gerald Amirault, was convicted in a separate
trial and is currently serving a 30-to-40-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of LeFave's victims, who is now 19, called the
deal to allow LeFave to remain free ``the lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts closure to 15 years of this,'' she said. ``We don't
have to pick up the paper and turn on the TV and hear that they are
doing this and doing that. Had she gone back to jail, I'm sure
there would have been pardons and appeals and this and that. This
is the lesser of two evils.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Amirault's lawyers may ask to have his sentence revised
as well, but they admitted that could be difficult, given
prosecutors' stated reluctance to support a reduction in his
sentence. He is jailed at Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference less than an hour after LeFave was freed,
Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley said she doubted her
office would be as supportive of a motion to revise Gerald
Amirault's sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his sister, Gerald Amirault has served less than half of
the minimum sentence on his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two separate cases and two separate defendants,''
said Coakley. ``He is serving 30 to 40 years in state prison. I see
nothing that would affect that sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said Gerald Amirault's conviction was a linchpin in
the overall case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do note that there are fewer female sex offenders, but when
there are women, there is often a primary male offender involved,''
Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that LeFave, 42, had already served a longer prison
term than many sex offenders and more time behind bars would not
protect the public or help the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley said she consulted with former Middlesex District
Attorney Scott Harshbarger, whose office prosecuted the Amiraults,
and former DA Thomas Reilly, whose office handled appeals in the
case. Neither objected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant District Attorney Lynn Rooney said the victims
and their families accepted the deal, which spares them further
parole board hearings and the specter of LeFave on television
proclaiming her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   When bizarre, horrific stories emerged in 1984 about toddlers at
Fells Acres being sexually abused, the arrest and prosecution of
the Amiraults became the first wide-scale case of child molestation
in metropolitan Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Using potentially suggestive interviewing techniques that have
since been retooled, investigators wove a sordid saga of
schoolhouse molestation, including claims that children were tied
naked to a tree in the schoolyard and sexually abused by a clown in
a ``magic room.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade after their convictions, other cases of mass child
molestation crumbled amid concerns that the charges were grounded
in group hysteria and not solid evidence. The tide began to turn,
both here and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Popular opinion and courtroom verdicts shifted away from the
once-unchallenged belief that children always tell the truth _ even
when coaxed by investigators or when their claims seem truly
unbelievable. The Fells Acres case became a flashpoint for those
who think investigators pushed too hard and accepted too much.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave's cause has been championed nationally, most notably by
the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. Dorothy Rabinowitz,
a Journal editorial writer, even helped publicize a fund to pay the
legal bills of people, like LeFave, who say they were wrongly
convicted of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of uncertainty, LeFave has put away the jeans and
underwear packed in the bag she expected to lug back to
MCI-Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, LeFave's lawyer, Jamie Sultan, had been
negotiating with Coakley over the remainder of her sentence. But
LeFave didn't decide to drop her quest for exoneration until
Wednesday, she said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave said she is relieved that she will not have to return to
the prison where she shared a cell with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was on a visit to her mother's grave that she
meditated on the decision to give up further appeals in exchange
for freedom. She decided that her mother would have agreed with her
friends and lawyers and advised her to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Forfeiting the book and movie deals she has been offered over
the past decade was not hard, she said. And the standard conditions
of probation for a sex offense _ such as not having contact with
children under age 16 or taking a job that would bring her in
contact with children _ did not faze her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave said she has accepted the fact that her victims believe
she is guilty and that she is unlikely ever to change their minds.
She has given up the notion of ever speaking to them directly but
hopes someday they will investigate the case themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she struggles with her failure to win vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel grateful to Martha Coakley for allowing me some
relief,'' she said. ``I'll take responsibility for what Martha
Coakley has offered me and respect it and try hard to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some people hand her their babies as a gesture of faith
when they recognize her on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people have worked so hard for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since her conviction was reinstated in August, Harvard law
professor Charles Ogletree and a team of law students fashioned an
argument that was presented to Judge Chernoff: that LeFave's
original lawyers should have presented findings by social
scientists that show that long terms of probation are appropriate
in sex offense cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan said he turned to Ogletree after the SJC defeat, looking
for fresh strategies when there was no chance of revisiting the
guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But as happy as Sultan and LeFave were to have her sitting in
his office Thursday rather than in a cell in Framingham, there was
no celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful, but I just wish it was right,'' she said, her
eyes filling with tears.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two months after a rescue team failed to free her from
fishing line that was cutting her shoulder, a Northern right whale
has died off the coast of northern New Jersey, in what might be the
second human-caused death of the rare animals this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 300 Northern right whales are left, making the death
of even a single animal _ especially a sexually mature female _ a
cause for concern about the survival of the species.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause of death has not been determined, the autopsy
on the 45-foot, 60-ton animal is expected to focus on a 7-inch deep
gash in her shoulder caused by the fishing gear. A second female
whale, nicknamed Staccato, died last spring off Cape Cod after she
was struck by a ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset that this whale has died and we had a ship
strike earlier, but that doesn't mean that everything is broken,''
said Andrew Rosenberg, deputy director of the National Marine
Fisheries Service, the agency in charge of protecting the whale.
``Some good things are happening, but this is a long- term
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the private Center for Coastal Studies in
Provincetown, Mass., had been tracking the whale, known as 2030,
since May when mariners reported that rope and fishing net had
become wrapped around her body. A crew from the center tried to cut
off the lines in September, but was unable to remove the most
tightly wrapped line.
</P>
<P>
   Ship strikes and fishing gear entanglements, especially gill
nets and lobster lines, are the leading human causes of right whale
deaths, preventing the right whale population from coming back
despite 70 years of federal protection.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the National Marine Fisheries Service and
coastal states such as Massachusetts have stepped up efforts to
help the whales, temporarily closing some fisheries, requiring gear
that is less likely to entangle the animals, and requiring ships to
report when they are near the whales.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 2030 was one of three right whales that became
entangled in fishing gear this summer in Canada's Bay of Fundy.
</P>
<P>
   And 2030's movements after she became entangled show how
difficult it is to protect such a far-ranging animal. Based on a
satellite tag the rescue crew place, 2030 swam 400 miles between
Nova Scotia and New York City in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut were scheduled
to begin the autopsy on 2030, on the shore near the Coast Guard
station in Cape May, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   If the fishing gear killed the animal, the National Marine
Fisheries Service could order a fresh round of fishing restrictions
since the killing of even a single right whale violates two federal
laws.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rosenberg said there are signs of new initiatives:
Because of lobbying by Massachusetts legislators, Congress just
approved $4.1 million for research into reducing ship strikes and
fishing gear entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   `We're doing everything we can to protect whales,'' said
Rosenberg, ``but we're not there yet.''

 Religious Rights in the Workplace  &HT;     Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The government and the private sector have yet to resolve
definitively which religious rights are acceptable in the
workplace. With the help of Howard A. Simon, employment lawyer at
Landels, Ripley and Diamond in San Francisco, and other experts,
here are questions and answers about religion in the workplace:
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What constitutes a religion that is protected in the
workplace?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights code,
religion is any moral or ethical belief held as strongly as
traditional religious views, even if an organized religion does not
espouse such beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does that mean an employee could start his own religion and
be protected if she or he wants to leave early on Fridays?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Yes. ``It need not be part of any organized religion,''
Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Q: Is vegetarianism considered a religion?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says yes. In
1996, a bus driver for the Orange County Transportation Authority
was fired for refusing to pass out free hamburger coupons to
riders. Bruce Anderson said it went against his devout vegetarian
belief that animals should not be killed or eaten. The EEOC ruled
that Anderson had been terminated unfairly and violated his civil
rights. He was awarded $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can a religious institution, such as a parochial school,
forbid the hiring of workers outside the institution's faith?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Religious institutions are exempt from the provisions of
Title VII, and that position has been in upheld in several cases.
For example, in 1995, a Michigan court ruled that Catholic schools
do not need to hire Protestant teachers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is an employer always obligated to compensate an employee for
his absence from work for a religious holiday?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Generally, an employer is not required to pay an employee
for time off taken for an observance. The U.S. Supreme Court held
that merely allowing an employee unpaid leave for a religious
holiday qualifies as ``reasonable accommodation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are employees always allowed to wear religious garb and
symbols?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Not always. It depends on the job and the garb. For
safety reasons, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has ruled that machinists exposed to toxic gases
must be clean-shaven and wear masks, a regulation that has survived
tests by Sikhs. But OSHA recently did exempt Sikhs wearing turbans
from hard-hat rules.

 Providian Quarterly Profits Up 83%  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Credit card giant Providian Financial, showing its earnings machine
is still in gear despite a high-profile consumer fraud scandal,
said yesterday that its third-quarter profit soared 83 percent from
a year ago.
<P>
   The San Francisco company blew past Wall Street estimates,
posting net income of $150.9 million ($1.04 a share) compared with
$82.6 million (57 cents) in the three months ended September 1998.
The nation's sixth-largest credit card issuer was expected to earn
95 cents a share in the most recent period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were impressed by Providian's ability to draw
new customers and build customer loan balances in the teeth of bad
publicity. During the quarter, the company added 1 million new
accounts to reach a total of 11 million customers and raised the
value of its outstanding loans by $2.1 billion, a 13 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produced outstanding numbers'' said Todd Pitsinger, an
analyst with the Virginia brokerage firm Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's growth took place amid a spate of private lawsuits,
as well as probes by bank regulators and the San Francisco district
attorney's office of Providian's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups charge the company with deceiving customers
about interest rates and product sales, and gouging them with fees.
Providian has never admitted wrongdoing but recently put in place
reforms to rewrite marketing sales language and make it easier for
customers to settle complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Providian Chief Financial Officer David Petrini told analysts
yesterday that the company has given customer service workers
authority to offer customers refunds or otherwise resolve problems.
As a result, he said, the company is settling more complaints on
the first call.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company said consumers are lodging fewer
complaints against it with consumer and law enforcement agencies.
For example, the Better Business Bureau forwarded 38 complaints to
Providian in September, compared with 65 in March, before public
controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said it is too early to conclude that
Providian has fundamentally cleaned up its act. ``The bottom line
is that their customer base has expanded and it doesn't matter
whether the changes are significant or superficial,'' said
Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst with Jefferies &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists said Providian has curbed the most extreme
abuses _ such as slapping customers with late fees even though they
paid on time _ but continues to use misleading sales tactics, such
as hiding annual fee disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they said, the company gets too much of its profits
from fees, a sign it may be soaking customers. A recent Standard &AMP;
Poor's study calculated that the company gets 49 percent of its
income from fees, seven percentage points more than its nearest
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pat Wallace, president of the Oakland Better Business
Bureau: ``They've made a couple of changes, but they're still doing
things that are not acceptable.''

LONG CHAPTER IN CASE ENDS, BUT NOBODY WINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 w/FELLS-ACRES   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It began in 1984 with the claims of a 5-year-old boy
and quickly spiraled into the biggest child sexual abuse case in
the state's history. Some 40 children said they had been fondled,
violated, and photographed nude at the Fells Acres Day School in
Malden, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   The trials of defendants Violet Amirault, the school's elderly
owner, and her two adult children, Gerald Amirault and Cheryl
Amirault LeFave _ against the backdrop of other sensational
child-abuse cases nationwide _ grabbed headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Justice seemed served when mother, son, and daughter were
convicted of molesting children entrusted in their care and slapped
with long prison tems.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1990s, similar day care sexual abuse cases
around the country slowly began to collapse. Wild claims by the
children were questioned and scrutinized. And techniques used to
investigate those claims were discredited.
</P>
<P>
   As public opinion shifted, supporters began to insist that the
Amiraults themselves were the victims: of public hysteria and
ill-trained investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Thursday, after recently losing her last appeal to the
Supreme Judicial Court, LeFave struck a deal with the government:
She would gain her freedom, but would forever be known as a
convicted child molester.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Gerald Amirault remains behind bars, serving a
30- to 40-year prison term for his 1986 conviction for molesting
nine children, the case still lingers.
</P>
<P>
   There remains suspicion in the eyes of the public that LeFave
and her brother were wrongly convicted by investigative techniques
that may have prompted the children to fabricate stories of sexual
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, prosecutors' efforts to gag LeFave by barring her
from TV appearances will fuel speculation that they want the case
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has endured injustice and unfairness, but made the
decision to preserve her freedom because the struggle to reclaim it
would have been extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible,''
said Elliot M. Weinstein, a criminal defense lawyer and past
president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Although dozens of children contended they were abused at Fells
Acres between 1981 and 1984, only nine testified against Gerald
Amirault, and four testified against his mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   The children, ages 3 to 6 years old, said the Amiraults had
sexually assaulted them, used objects to abuse them, and
photographed them in a ``magic room.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said Gerald Amirault dressed as a clown while abusing them,
and one 6-year-old boy said he was bitten by a robot at the school,
tied naked to a tree in front of teachers, and forced to watch
LeFave pull the legs off a squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of the children,
suggesting their claims were too fantastic, but jurors concluded
that the children were telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, however, some of the parents have acknowledged that
some of the bizarre claims may have been exaggerated by the
children. But they insist the youngsters couldn't have had the
knowledge to describe sexualy explicit acts unless they had been
victimized.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spotlight will shift to Gerald Amirault, who has
proclaimed his innocence just as loudly as his sister but has not
garnered as much public attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think that women do these kinds of things so
there was a little bias there,'' said Thomas Hoopes, a lawyer who
predicted that people will now take a harder look at Amirault's
case. ``What's happened to her is going to be a wedge to reopen his
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deal with LeFave, however, each side gets something, but
nobody really wins.
</P>
<P>
   LeFave is free, but can never clear her name. The children who
testified against LeFave can now move on with their lives, knowing
the case involving LeFave won't be overturned so they'll never be
asked to testify again. But the woman convicted of abusing them now
walks free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's stomach is just a little less sick,''
Hoopes said. ``She gets her freedom and the government has already
gotten as much time for her in jail as anybody who would have been
convicted of this type of case normally would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Laurence Hardoon, who prosecuted the cases against the
Amiraults and LeFave and is now in private practice, said the deal
does not mark a change in the government's view of LeFave's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district attorney has elected to pursue this resolution
for one reason and one reason alone _ to bring closure and finality
to the families involved in this case,'' Hardoon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the perspective of the parents, had (LeFave) gone back to
prison this case would have come up year after year after year as a
parole matter, and the parents would have had to confront it and
deal with it on an ongoing basis every year, and they were tired of
dealing with it,'' he said. ``The notion of finally cementing the
integrity of the criminal convictions and putting this matter to
rest was something that they wanted for themselves and for their
children.''

 Wind River Buys a Top Competitor  &HT;     By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Wind River Systems of Alameda, which makes software that runs
such everyday devices as cars, cameras and telephones, yesterday
bought one of its top rivals, Integrated Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale,
for about $445 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Wind River a stable of ``embedded software''
used in the telecommunications, consumer electronics, automotive
and aerospace industries. Perhaps even more importantly, it will
give the fast-growing company ISI's 728 employees, including many
hard-to-hire development and service engineers. Wind River employs
800 people.
</P>
<P>
   Wind River is best known for making the software that helped run
the Mars Pathfinder in 1997, but its operating systems are also
embedded in dozens of common devices.
</P>
<P>
   As computer chips proliferate in those devices, software is
needed to tell the chips what to do. Wind River and ISI make that
software.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, each share of ISI stock will be
exchanged for .92 shares of Wind River stock. ISI closed yesterday
up 13 cents, at $10.56. Wind River closed down 94 cents, at $20.06.
At that price, ISI would be valued at $18.45 per share, a 75
percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge win for both organizations. It's a
situation where one and one equals three,'' said Matt Belkin, an
analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``It's something
they should have done a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was initially proposed when the two companies' founders
and chairmen, Jerry Fiddler from Wind River and Naren Gupta of ISI,
had dinner together about six weeks ago. When Tom St. Dennis joined
Wind River as its chief executive last month, his first day on the
job included a meeting with his ISI counterpart, Chuck Boesenberg.
</P>
<P>
   St. Dennis will continue to run Wind River, while Boesenberg
will retire. Fiddler will remain chairman, with Gupta joining Wind
River's board as vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddler said the driving force behind the deal is the growing
number of devices that provide access to the Internet _ from cars
to cameras to game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing very, very quickly here,'' he said.
``We're moving beyond the world where most people access
information from desktop computers. Together, we're extremely well
positioned to do well in that world.''
</P>
<P>
   The market for such embedded systems is increasingly
competitive, however, particularly as software giant Microsoft
Corp. aggressively pushes its Windows CE operating system for
handheld computers, video game consoles and other gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   According to the industry publication Electronic Engineering
Times, Wind River's software, known as VxWorks, holds a 25 percent
market share in the embedded world, more than any other company.
ISI's pSOS System is No.2, with 11 percent. Windows CE trails about
10 other vendors with a relatively insignificant market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their combination is going to put them far above and beyond
anything any of the other players are capable of,'' said Belkin,
the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent quarter, which ended July 31, Wind River
reported net income of $8.5 million on revenues of $73.1 million.
For ISI, in the quarter that ended August 31, the company reported
a loss of $7.4 million on revenue of $35 million.

 Momentum Is Building for Biotech IPOs  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Maxygen Inc. of Redwood City yesterday became the latest Bay
Area biotech firm to file an initial public offering that will test
Wall Street's appetite for money-losing startups in the early
stages of drug development.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the year, prevailing wisdom has been that investors
were dot-com crazy and biotech averse. Indeed, biotech IPOs slumped
from a high of $1.5 billion in 1996 to just $369 million last year
and had only reached $316 million as of September, according to
Burrill &AMP; Co., the San Francisco investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Companies believe the time is ripe for the IPOs because biotech
has been one of the stronger sectors in the market this year, and
they want to raise the money now rather than miss this market
opportunity. The money is needed to fund research and also to give
the companies' private backers a chance to recoup their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Tularik Inc. of South San Francisco decided to test the IPO
waters a week ago with a filing that would value the firm at about
$500 million. That is an aggressive market cap target for an
8-year-old company whose lead drug candidate is still in early
stage Federal Drug Administration trials.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, Caliper Technologies of Mountain View, which
builds chips to analyze fluid samples, filed a $60 million offering
to see whether the window is open for early stage biotech
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know if the window's open until somebody tries to
jump through it,'' said Dave Flores, publisher of the BioCentury
Newsletter in San Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to declare it a wide open window, but there
appears to be a crack,'' said Scott Morrison, life sciences
director in the Palo Alto office of Ernst &AMP; Young, who advised all
three IPO hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Slattery, who is life science fund manager for Amerindo
Investment Advisors in New York, said institutional buyers
``continue to look for companies with promising late stage
products,'' and suggested the current offerings face a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of positive trends favoring biotech IPOs,
but institutions aren't getting breathless to buy,'' said Gayatri
Sondhi, with Boston Consulting Group. ``Each of these companies is
going to have to make their case on its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen, which has hired Goldman Sachs to help it raise $80
million, bases its case on its ``molecular breeding'' technology.
Maxygen has shown that by mixing different proteins _ think of it
as shuffling two decks of cards _ it can produce chemicals with
stronger properties.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was conceived by Dutch scientist Willem Stemmer,
who founded the company in 1997 with help from biotech inventor
Alejandro Zaffaroni and venture capitalist Isaac Stein, who is also
chairman of UCSF Stanford Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen, which lost $4.7 million last year on revenues of $5.2
million, is betting its molecular breeding technology will lead to
more powerful drugs and industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Tularik, the best known of the three current hopefuls, spun off
from Genentech in 1991 to focus on research on drugs for cancer,
obesity, diabetes and other diseases. It was founded by David
Goeddel, the first scientist hired at Genentech, a man whom Forbes
ASAP has called ``biotech's original brilliant scientist.''

   But Goeddel's reputation was tarnished earlier this year when a
witness in a patent infringement case brought by the University of
California against Genentech testified that Goeddel had fudged an
experiment 20 years ago. Goeddel denied the charges and the case
ended in a hung jury.

<P>
   Nevertheless, Tularik is generally lauded for its scientific
prowess but has been criticized for failure to turn its ideas into
products. Its most advanced drug candidate is an anti-cancer
compound that it licensed from another drug developer and is still
in early stage human clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   But Tularik hopes that, with help from Lehman Brothers, it can
raise between $69 million and $81 million in December by selling
6.25 million shares at $11 to $13 per share. The company, which has
raised $160 million from private sources in its history, lost $10.5
million last year on revenues of $21.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Caliper is hoping to raise $60 million by exciting investors
with the potential of lab-on-a-chip technology. Its custom-designed
chips can analyze minute amounts of experimental fluids far faster
than conventional methods. Caliper contends it can develop a
thriving business from selling these time-saving devices to
industrial labs.
</P>
<P>
   Caliper is in the thick of competition with other startups that
make similar chips, like Aclara Biosciences of Hayward and Orchid
Biocomputer of Princeton New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Caliper lost $3 million in fiscal 1999 on revenues of $8.2
million. The company, whose IPO is being handled by Credit Suisse
First Boston, has not set a date or fixed a number of shares on the
offering.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Companies Struggle to Accommodate Workers of Different
Religious  Faiths Without Alienating Others 
 &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Trouble at work started for Kathryn Hicks two years ago when she
married a man from Bangladesh, converted to Islam and legally
changed her name to Aysha Shahid.
<P>
   After she began wearing traditional Muslim dress (called a
hijab), she said managers at the Sam's Club store in Vacaville,
where she had worked since 1993, began harassing her constantly.
Some managers told her they thought she had joined a terrorist
organization and, she said, they asked her to stop wearing the head
scarf because they wanted to see her blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took pictures of me on Halloween and said `I think you'll
win the best costume contest,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Shahid didn't feel comfortable asking for
Friday afternoons off for prayer. Finally, in June, Shahid quit and
became one of the increasing numbers of workers to file a religious
discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A Sam's Club spokeswoman confirmed that the company has received
the complaint but would say only that ``Wal-Mart has zero tolerance
for any type of discrimination.'' The EEOC reports that religious
discrimination complaints have increased in each of the past five
years. Of the 1,786 allegations filed in fiscal 1998, 325 had
favorable outcomes for the complainants. In 1996, 1,584 complaints
were filed, with complainants winning 165.
</P>
<P>
   Secularism no longer is the norm on the job. Seventy percent of
respondents to a Personnel Journal magazine survey believe that
spirituality has a place at work. And companies are struggling for
ways to accommodate workers of different faiths without promoting
proselytizing among workers or causing an undue hardship on the
company or its nonreligious workers.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual expression has been the source of much conflict and
legal battles in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Cases have run the gamut, from a Jehovah's Witness waitress at
Chi-Chi's restaurant in Baltimore who objected to singing ``Happy
Birthday'' to patrons on religious grounds to a Sikh assembly line
worker in Durham, N.C., who refused to cut his hair or beard
because of religious edicts to a Roman Catholic in Iowa who said
her religious convictions dictated her to wear a graphic
anti-abortion button at work.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, especially in culturally diverse regions such as
the Bay Area, have instituted flexible holiday scheduling so that
workers can celebrate Ramadan or the pagan solstice in lieu of
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, such as Oracle in Redwood Shores, have set
aside prayer rooms for employees. Microsoft has noon Torah study
classes, and Boeing workers throughout California can study the
Bible, Koran and Hindu principles during break-time sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``High tech firms are familiar with different cultures, but
discrimination is still prevalent with small companies,'' said
Abdussalam Chouia, executive director of the Northern California
chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ``But a
Muslim who works in the retail or the hotel industry has it
tougher. It's just a matter of educating the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco employment lawyer Mukesh Advani, a Hindu from
India, has represented Sikhs claiming discrimination because they
are not allowed to wear turbans or carry a kirpan, a 7-inch
ceremonial dagger. He said employers just need to be educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sikhs have real problems in certain jobs, especially those
involving dealing with people, like in hotels or sales,'' Advani
said. ``If you go to a Sikh temple in the Bay Area, half the people
there will be clean-shaven because they say they have to be for
their jobs. Employers don't know it's a symbol of their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 Society of Human Resources Management survey of 750
human resource professionals, only 13 percent reported that their
companies accommodated religious attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When businesses institute dress codes, they don't think about
religion, usually,'' said Hina Azam, a professor of Islamic studies
at St. Mary's College in Moraga and an official with American
Muslims Intent on Learning and Activism. ``We don't dress (in
hijabs) trying to make some point or to make others feel
uncomfortable. It's easier for me, working at a college. But in
corporate world, friends of mine have had real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Court rulings have been split on whether companies must
accommodate employees' requests to dress according to their
religious beliefs. Few regulations are on the books, but the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration did recently exempt
Sikhs who wear turbans from its hard-hat rules.
</P>
<P>
   Howard A. Simon, a lawyer at Landels, Ripley and Diamond in San
Francisco who spoke at a recent ``Religion at Work'' seminar about
accommodation, said laws still are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fluid concept,'' Simon said. ``(Employers) have to
tread carefully and use the same standard used under every other
kind of protected category under Title VII, based on race, gender
or nationality. It calls for reasonable accommodation for the
employee's beliefs unless to do so would create an undue hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS, for instance, has a policy whereby drivers may not have
facial hair. A Muslim challenged that policy. They gave him what
they thought was a comparable job _ same pay, but not driving. UPS
would have won the case for reasonable accommodation, except the
job wasn't available right away. There was a two-year waiting
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cases, though, have resulted in companies or organizations
changing dress codes without moving traditionally dressed employees
to behind-the-scenes jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On October 4, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling
supporting the rights of Muslim police officers in Newark, N.J., to
wear beards despite a department policy forbidding facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   Chouia says some Bay Area employers comply after his
organization explains the religious significance of a female
worker's hijab. Two years ago, the Office Depot store in Santa
Clara suspended Elizabeth Castillon for violating the dress code by
wearing a head scarf, but she was reinstated after Chouia's group
called the company's human resources office.
</P>
<P>
   Most claims aren't so easily resolved, however.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Al-Sayeh, a Muslim, said he was fired from the Stevens
Creek Nissan auto dealership in San Jose in March because he
insisted he have Friday afternoons off to go to his mosque. He has
contacted the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also were disrespectful to me,'' Al-Sayeh said. ``I was
attending a meeting in the conference room and one of the managers
cleaned the board with my prayer rug.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Van Binsbergen, general manager at Stevens Creek Nissan,
said Al-Sayeh's claim is false. ``He's making up a lot of stories
to cover himself for not being a good worker,'' said Van
Binsbergen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Muslims and Sikhs who face dress-code problems.
Vanessa McCauley of Allen, Texas, was a flight attendant for
Southwest Airlines for 12 years and wore a Christian cross
throughout her employment. It wasn't until a co-worker complained
in 1994 that Southwest officials told her to stop outwardly wearing
her cross and to cease carrying her Bible to read during down time
at airports.
</P>
<P>
   McCauley filed suit and won her case in 1996. The jury, though,
did not award her any damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret a thing,'' McCauley said. ``I wore my cross as
an expression of my faith in Jesus Christ. If you have a faith in
Christ, you're going to talk about it because it's important to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector,  &LR; though, &LR; employees aren't allowed to
proselytize on the job, unless the person they are speaking to is a
willing participant, according to Simon. Employers also have some
control over the religious displays at the workplace, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That woman who felt compelled by her Roman Catholic beliefs to
wear a button showing graphic fetus lost her case,'' Simon said.
``The employer came up with clever accommodation. (It) gave her the
choice of wearing the button only in her cubicle, covering up the
button when she was out of her cubicle or wear an anti-abortion
slogan on (a) button without the graphic image. She said no to all
of it. The employer won the case because the accommodation offered
met her religious obligation to express her belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws also are nebulous on just how far an employee can discuss
and display their religious beliefs without harassing co-workers.
Simply overhearing a co-worker speaking about religion does not
qualify as harassment, precedents show.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bernstein, director of the Bay Area chapter of the
Anti-Defamation League, said he receives many calls from Jews
complaining of workplace prayer and proselytizing by Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes, it's not so much a legal issue as a sensitivity
issue,'' Bernstein said. ``If a manager starts a meeting with a
Christian prayer, those in minority religions feel excluded and
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fellowship of Companies for Christ International, an
organization based in Atlanta that instructs CEOs on ways of
implementing Christian values into their companies' corporate
cultures, encourages prayer in the office.
</P>
<P>
   `If you follow the Christ way, no worker from another culture
should have a problem with it,'' said David Jorgenson, the
organization's West Coast field ministry director.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, said he is concerned about
companies that permeate their corporate cultures around religious
tenets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's nothing we can do unless they reach the `hostile
environment' stage,'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it's much easier for employees to convince a company
to accommodate them if they already have the job. That's why many
Muslims and Sikhs do not wear traditional clothing to interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get the job, Muslim women will slowly try it out &LR; 
 &LR; wearing hijab and gauge the reaction,'' Azam said. ``They
shouldn't have to do that.''

 &HT;    Falcons' infirmary empty
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the season the Falcons have had, Thursday was
like a vacation for trainer Ron Medlin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since the first day of training camp that
every player on the active roster practiced. No wonder Medlin kept
walking when that was mentioned to him.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want to jinx anything after linebackers Jessie Tuggle
(strained left patella tendon), Keith Brooking (sprained right
knee), and Henri Crockett (swelling in left knee) returned after
not practicing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, reserve safety Johndale Carty (strained left hamstring),
and Brooking _ who all missed last Sunday's game _ are still listed
as doubtful for Monday's game at Pittsburgh (3-3).
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1-5 season where starters have missed nine games,
All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson (knee surgery) is out for the
season, and quarterback Chris Chandler has missed three games and
parts of the other three, it's OK to dream, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as confident ... because we haven't been able to
work together much,'' coach Dan Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Defensive end) Chuck Smith (who sprained his right big toe on
the first day of camp) is close to 100 percent, Chris (Chandler,
who has battled a right hamstring injury) was better than in a long
time. Hopefully, you can go through a game that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle had to readjust the wrap on his left leg, and Brooking
split time with Craig Sauer. But progress is progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have your whole team out there,'' Brooking said,
``that definitely gives the team more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserves also have been hit. Defensive tackle Ed Jasper, who
will play Monday, missed the past three games with a left knee
injury. Punt and kickoff returner Tim Dwight, who will start at
wide receiver, missed two games with a right hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to see the entire corps out there,'' said cornerback
Michael Booker, who missed the first three games with a right thigh
injury. ``You can practice all the packages. It's a pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   In training camp, running back Gary Downs and rookie center Todd
McClure suffered season-ending knee injuries, and tight end O.J.
Santiago missed two weeks after being thrown from a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Dwight, Chris Calloway, Terance Mathis, Ronnie
Harris and Jammi German all missed practice with injuries. Smith
missed nearly three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Medlin's staff couldn't rest Thursday, however.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Connor, director of pro player personnel, was stung by a
wasp and had to be treated.

HOUSE SETS STAGE FOR PRESIDENTIAL VETO ON SPENDING BILLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite their agreement to negotiate a
comprehensive budget deal with President Clinton, House Republicans
continued to pass piecemeal appropriations measures Thursday that
are almost certain to draw presidential vetoes and prolong the
bitter fight over Year 2000 spending.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to wrap up the last of the 13 appropriations measures
before their self-imposed deadline of Friday, the House
reauthorized the $9.9 billion Title I education program designed to
help poor and disadvantaged schoolchildren compete.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, members rejected an amendment to Title I
offered by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, that would
have provided vouchers worth up to $3,500 to help poor families pay
for private school education for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two Republicans joined Democrats in turning aside the
amendment by a vote of 257-166, dealing a blow to a proposal that
has long been the centerpiece of federal education reform efforts
pushed by conservative GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure said it would siphon off tax dollars
from a public education system in need of more funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Title I reauthorization was just one of several funding
measures Republican leaders sought to rush through the House late
Thursday night as talks with White House Budget Director Jack Lew _
aimed at reaching a consensus on overall government spending for
next year _ appeared to stall.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., described the talks
as ``fraudulent'' anyway because, he said, Republicans kept pushing
legislation containing ``problems'' they agreed to work out with
Clinton. He blamed House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who is
leading the GOP budget effort, for refusing to negotiate in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent that Tom DeLay is running the strategy and the
show, and Republicans are not going to do what the president has
asked them to do,'' Gephardt said. ``They're going to continue with
their one-bill-at-a-time strategy and their continuance of
demagoguing about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart also complained about
the Republicans' strategy of trying to force a presidential veto so
they can claim in next year's elections that Clinton killed bills
that included increased funding for important programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also charging that Clinton's spending
priorities, such as hiring new teachers and police officers, would
eat into the Social Security Trust Fund next year even though he
has proposed paying for them by increasing the cigarette tax,
closing foreign tax loopholes and penalizing polluters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make any progress as long as they're in
that mindset,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president will continue to veto the bills that
``don't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has signed into law only six of the 13 annual
appropriations bills needed to keep the government operating. The
House was still working on the last two bills to fund interior,
labor, education, health and welfare _ late Thursday night, three
weeks after the Oct. 1 deadline set by law for wrapping up the
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vetoed two spending bills already and is threatening
to veto at least three others because they do not meet his
priorities on education, law enforcement, foreign aid and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stress that their spending bills provide more money
for education and other programs than the president requested
without dipping into Social Security surpluses. But to keep their
pledge not to spend Social Security money next year, GOP leaders
are proposing across-the-board cuts in many programs.
</P>
<P>
   They are also borrowing from future budgets in an effort to pay
for some of the increases demanded by their own colleagues. In
addition, Republican members said Thursday that a plan put forward
by DeLay to spread out lump-sum earned income tax credit payments
to the poor over 12 months to save money is also being revived as
``a voluntary program.'' Those who receive the payments would have
the option of taking them in monthly installments.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal was shot down last month by Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the leading GOP presidential candidate, who likened it to
trying to balance the budget ``on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The creative accounting methods have been ridiculed by both
sides of the aisle as well as the Congressional Budget Office,
which has said that the GOP bills could still end up borrowing $14
billion to $30 billion next year from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton would not accept borrowing from future
budgets, which he likened to paying ``for our vacation and our new
car'' by putting off the mortgage payment until later.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Republicans continued to contend that they are not
tapping Social Security money and are trying to lay ``what our
positions are'' by passing ``one bill at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we want to do that is that if (the president) has
specific disagreements, we can find out what they are. We want to
deal with these bills one at a time so that they retain their
identity,'' said House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W.
``Bill'' Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've laid out what our positions are,'' added House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``The message is, talk to us.''
</P>
<P>
   By forcing Clinton to negotiate one spending measure at a time,
Republicans hope to avoid one large omnibus bill like the one they
agreed to last year that met the balanced budget guidelines but
still ended up giving the president more spending than Republicans
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Young said his party is simply trying to avoid a similar
``disaster,'' as he put, from occurring again this year.
</P>
<P>
   When they met earlier this week at the White House, Clinton and
Republican leaders said they wanted to wrap up their negotiations
by Tuesday. Lew, the president's budget director, said that it was
still possible to have a final deal by then. But he said the
Republican tactics so far are ``not constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew said he was ``astonished,'' for example, that DeLay held a
news conference a day after the White House meeting and accused the
president of still trying to spend Social Security money even
though he agreed with Republicans in their meeting that the trust
fund would be off limits next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big differences between us are not money ... but policy,''
he said.

   MORGAN STANLEY FINDS ITS DREAM ADDRESS TAKEN
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, trumpeting its new online stock
trading service, has discovered that somebody already has its
desired Internet address, www.msdwonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is telling the story, that somebody is either a
17-year-old schoolboy who created a website for mountain-bike
racing, or an opportunistic ``cybersquatter'' who registered dozens

<P>
   HOUSEHOLD STOCK OWNERSHIP SOARS
</P>
<P>
   The number of stock owners in the nation soared to 78.7 million
people early this year, 85 percent more than in 1983 when the long
bull market was getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks fell, with IBM hammered after an earnings
warning. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 94.67 points, to
10,297.69, but the Nasdaq composite index gained 13.82 points, to
2,801.95. The S&AMP;P 500 slipped 5.82 points, to 1,283.61.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT SLIPS AT COKE; SHARES RISE
</P>
<P>
   Although Coca-Cola sales improved, third-quarter earnings fell
11.4 percent, to 32 cents a share, as forecast. Volume worldwide,
measured in cases sold, rose 3.5 percent, though about one point of
that growth came from Cadbury Schweppes brands that Coke acquired
in July. The company had forecast an increase of 2 percent.
Coca-Cola shares rose $1.5625, to $54.3125.
</P>
<P>
   GILLETTE ISSUES EARNINGS WARNING
</P>
<P>
   Gillette warned of an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit
and said that it might sell its Braun appliance and Paper Mate and
Parker pens businesses. Third-quarter operating profit fell 0.03
percent.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Mattel posted a 42 percent earnings decline, to 32 cents a
share, matching estimates. It cited a $105 million loss at the
Learning Co., a software maker for which it spent $3.8 billion five
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   TYCO PROFIT MORE THAN TRIPLES
</P>
<P>
   Tyco International, the world's biggest maker of electronic
connectors, said that its fourth-quarter profit more than tripled.
``Their free cash flow exceeded earnings,'' said Phua Young, an
analyst for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   MERCK, UP 13 PERCENT, MEETS FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Merck's third-quarter profit rose 13 percent, meeting Wall
Street's forecasts, thanks to rising sales of its top-selling
prescription drug, the cholesterol-lowering pill Zocor.
</P>
<P>
   MANNESMANN CHIEF DEFENDS DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, Germany's acquisitive telecommunications giant,
intensified the competition to dominate European mobile phone
markets, offering $33 billion in stock and cash for Orange,
Britain's No. 3 cellular operator. Investors sent Mannesmann's
stock down almost 8 percent in Frankfurt, even as Klaus Esser, the
chief executive, argued that Orange would grow more rapidly than
One 2 One, which rival Deutsche Telekom bought two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   SUBSIDIES TO RISE FOR RURAL PHONES
</P>
<P>
   The FCC voted to raise the subsidies that help make phone

DAUGHTER OF NATION'S FOUNDING LEADER ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ Popular opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri was
elected vice president of Indonesia Thursday, walking off with the
consolation prize the day after her stunning loss of the
presidency. Her win appeased fervent supporters who had rioted in
fury and frustration when the daughter of Indonesia's founding
president was denied the top job by the 700-member national
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's chief rivals for the vice presidency, the chairman of
the party that ruled Indonesia for 33 years and the armed forces
chief, withdrew from the race minutes before the vote, making way
for her victory in a move that was seen as putting aside party
interests to safeguard national stability.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidency, given the frail health of President
Abdurrahman Wahid and the close friendship between the two, will
take on a significance and power it never had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably will have to take up most of the responsibility
if his health fails, so in a way, this was the real presidential
election,'' said Smita Notosusanto, a political science lecturer at
University of Indonesia. The two ``get along very well. He
understands Mega the most _ others cannot work with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others praised the new governing team of populist
nationalist Megawati and Wahid, a moderate Muslim cleric, as a
combination that would satisfy a broad spectrum of the public. The
pair will likely appoint a coalition Cabinet that includes the
former ruling party, religious conservatives, and the military that
made their victory possible.
</P>
<P>
   The public upheaval, backroom deals, and last-minute politicking
around Megawati's loss and subsequent win were visible birthpangs
of the world's third-largest democracy, the culmination of a
17-month transition since student riots drove the longtime autocrat
President Suharto from power.
</P>
<P>
   There was also hope Thursday night that the ascension to the top
jobs of the three main opponents of the former regime _ Megawati,
Wahid, and new assembly speaker Amien Rais, a reform-minded Muslim
leader _ and the absence of the military from the core of a
government long run by a general, would help this fractious,
frustrated society to settle down to a period of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's win inspired a late-night party in Jakarta's main
traffic circle, with cars honking and the urban poor and students
who form her power base celebrating with cheers and firecrackers
for hours _ a welcome contrast to the violence that claimed two
lives and injured dozens the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and even some supporters had accused Megawati of growing
arrogance in the four months since her party won the largest share
in parliamentary elections, saying she refused to make deals with
other parties and expected the presidency to be handed to her on a
platter. It was unclear if she learned a lesson from her
humiliating loss _ that she cannot act as an aloof empress, but
must dig into the political trenches to make the new process of
democratic change work.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's inaugural address graciously reached out to all the
losers, including B.J. Habibie, who had succeeded Suharto as
president last year, and earned her a standing ovation from the
national assembly that a day earlier had denied her the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech far more specific than Wahid's presidential address,
she hit the themes of political and legal overhaul, clean
government, national reconcilation and free-market economic
recovery. She promised to ``ensure that the military and police
will be guarantors of our security,'' and significantly, she urged
her followers to accept her second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my children across the nation, please do not be goaded into
making emotional acts, because you see your mother is standing here
before you,'' said the 52-year-old erstwhile housewife whose calm,
maternal bearing is a major attraction for her loyalists. Revelers
celebrated downtown by hoisting a banner declaring, ``My Mother is
My President.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati prominently thanked the students whose street
demonstrations were the catalyst for Suharto's fall from power and
the pressure on the government to release political prisoners, free
the press, loosen military control, and elect democratic leaders.

<P>
   BELLA BELLA, British Columbia _ Disembarking from an inflatable
boat at James Bay, a party of eco-tourists hiked one recent morning
into a primeval cathedral of the world's largest temperate rain
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Wreaths of mist lifted from moss-draped cedar trees, revealing
stream banks strewn with salmon carcasses, their copper-colored
skins freshly punctured by black bears. Sailing low overhead, bald
eagles patrolled, beating the humid air with their wings. Once, the
stillness of a forest glade echoed with the distant howling of a
wolf pack.
</P>
<P>
   The only discordant note was a string of construction flags,
marking roads and a log dump for the day next spring when James Bay
is to be logged, when its ancient western red cedars are to be
converted to window sills and decks for American houses.
</P>
<P>
   After cutting 70 percent of the old-growth forest from Vancouver
Island, Canadian logging companies are now moving into what
environmentalists call ``the Brazil of the north'' _ a vast, barely
disturbed sea of trees, one-quarter of the world's remaining
temperate rain forest. Over the next 25 years, 50 of the coastal
forest's largest valleys are scheduled be logged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a collision of powerful forces is taking shape on this
remote coast, an archipelago where 4,500 people live, largely in
Indian villages, sprinkled over a land area larger than
Massachusetts and New Hampshire combined.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the logging industry of Canada, the world's
largest exporter of timber, pulp and newsprint. Half of the
nation's timber cut, or harvest, comes from British Columbia. Here,
Canada's largest trees grow in forests where 15 feet of rain can
fall in a year. But after suffering the nation's worst economic
performance last year, British Columbia has slashed logging
royalties to jump-start the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Although king timber still rules Canada's far west, logging
companies now face a trio of new players determined to defend what
many call the Great Bear Rain Forest: tour operators, Indian tribes
and a cross-border alliance of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   With three tourists visiting British Columbia for each of its 4
million residents, tourism now employs more people _ albeit at
lower wages _ than the forest products industry. With half a
million tourists, largely Americans, taking cruises every summer up
the inland passage from Vancouver to Anchorage, logging companies
have been forced to leave ``beauty fringes,'' or waterfront skirts
of trees that create illusions of deep forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the last great intact ecosystems of the world,
and more and more people want to see it,'' said Eric Boyum, the
captain of Ocean Light I, as he piloted his 67-foot cutter from
James Bay, where sea otters slipped off rocks, to open waters where
porpoises arced playfully. ``Our bookings are up 20 percent over
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to wholesale logging also is emerging from many of
British Columbia's 47 Indian tribes, which have long seemed
spectators to economic development. By one survey, 90 percent of
logging company workers are flown in from the southern part of the
province. In Bella Bella, the rundown waterfront capital of the
Heilstuk nation, only 20 local men have been hired for logging
jobs. Here, as elsewhere, natives have little legal access to trees
they consider their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for our people to see so many of our resources
sailing by, when our treaty has not been settled, while there are
so many unemployed,'' Phil Hogan, a tribal treaty negotiator, said
of barges that pass, stacked with logs. Peace treaties were never
signed with American Indian tribes west of the Continental Divide
because the tribes were never considered conquered.
</P>
<P>
   (On Thursday, Canada's Parliament started debate on approval of
a treaty with the Nisga'a tribe, the first land-rights treaty
reached with a British Columbia tribe in this century.)
</P>
<P>
   In a move strengthening Indian forest claims, Canada's Supreme
Court ruled two years ago that, in areas where no treaties had been
signed, tribes retained proprietary interest in the land and
resources. Impatient with the slow pace of treaty negotiations, one
interior tribe, the Westbank nation, started logging Sept. 7 on
government land without provincial consent. Half a dozen other
tribes have since started logging government land, and several
called for ``an international consumer boycott of companies who are
destroying forest resources with destructive logging of aboriginal
title lands without our consent.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for logging companies on the coast, the most threatening
boycott campaign is being waged by environmentalists who have made
successful appeals to companies in the United States, the largest
consumer of Canadian forest products.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Canadian environmentalists tried to slow rain
forest destruction by focusing on government officials. In 1993, in
the largest demonstration of civil disobedience in modern Canadian
history, 856 people were arrested for blocking a logging road on
Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   But in a province where forest products account for one in 17
jobs, politicians have long been swayed by the industry, either by
powerful companies or by powerful unions. Glen Clark, the
provincial premier who resigned in August, once called
environmentalists ``enemies of British Columbia.'' His successor,
Dan Miller, a former millworker from the north coast, used the term
``Soviet-style'' to describe government lumber policies and called
for privatizing provincial lands.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long suspected that the public was more
sympathetic to their cause than the politicians. Last fall, a poll
of provincial residents found that 70 percent opposed clear-cutting
on the central coast and that 74 percent said they would pay more
for paper or wood if they knew that the trees had been harvested in
a sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of Americans this year by Yankelovich Partners
pollsters, 62.5 percent of respondents said companies should not
use or sell products made from old-growth wood, 58.5 percent said
they supported legislation to end old-growth logging, and 43.5
percent said they would be less likely to do business with a
company using old-growth wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is irrelevant. It is the marketplace,'' said
Merran Smith, a forest campaigner for the Sierra Club of British
Columbia. ``We give Home Depot 25,000 postcards. Home Depot
responds.''
</P>
<P>
   In a major victory for the boycott campaign, Home Depot, the
home improvement retailer, announced on Aug. 26 that it would phase
out sales of wood from endangered forests by 2002. With 856 stores
worldwide, the Atlanta-based chain claims to be the largest wood
retailer in the world, selling about 10 percent of the world's
marketed supply. The chain's turnaround came after
environmentalists, led by the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, deluged
the company with postcards, sent a Great Bear Rain Forest bus to a
shareholder meeting, and erected a Home Depot protest billboard
over a clear-cut patch of forest north of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The government didn't listen, so we realized that the only way
to turn the situation around was to go directly to consumers,''
said Tamara Stark, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace in Vancouver.
After making inroads in Europe, Greenpeace has won pledges in the
last year to phase out use of old-growth wood from 20 Japanese
companies and from 27 U.S.-based Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a new phase this fall, the Sierra Club is campaigning for
city ordinances in New York and Los Angeles that would phase out
purchases of wood from old-growth forests that is not harvested in
a sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government purchasing accounts for 20 percent of wood
consumption in the U.S.,'' said Susan Holmes, the New York
City-based director of the club's Buy Good Wood campaign. ``In
Riverside Park, they are creating a bikeway-walkway that is using
hemlock from the coast of British Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Gifford Miller, a Democratic city councilman in New York and
sponsor of the ``selective purchasing'' legislation, said by
telephone from New York City: ``If Home Depot can do it, we can
too. New Yorkers would be horrified to learn that the park benches
they sit on, the boardwalks they walk on, are constructed at the
expense of beautiful old-growth forest that can never be
replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is rattling Vancouver's largest lumber companies.
Over the last decade, the provincial tree harvest has dropped by
one-quarter, depressed by Asia's economic contraction and by
growing consumer resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, you harvest a tree, you cut it into lumber, and
you put it on a boat. The customer was pretty abstract,'' said Tom
Stephens, president of MacMillan Bloedel, long a leading timber
company here. But, he added, ``if customer attitudes change, we
have to change too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, MacMillan Bloedel broke ranks with other companies in
the province and promised to phase out clear-cutting by 2002. This
year, about half the company's harvest is by ``variable
retention,'' a new sustainable system that relies on thinning or
cutting small patches.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the destruction caused by logging roads, the company
increasingly uses helicopters to pull high-value trees from the
forest. Stephens has consulted extensively with environmentalists.
``The company that is not sensitive to those issues simply will not
be in business very long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, shareholders of Weyerhaeuser Co. are to meet in
Vancouver to vote on a proposal to buy MacMillan Bloedel.
Weyerhaeuser has said it will honor the promise to phase out
clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan Bloedel and two other major companies want to defuse
the boycott by winning certification from the Forest Stewardship
Council, a Mexico-based group founded six years ago by
environmental and social groups. But the council is not expected to
develop harvesting standards for the rain forest here until the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   With profits low in the timber industry here, most companies
refuse to abandon clear-cutting. Bill Dumont, the chief forester
for Western Forest Products, which wants to log James Bay next
year, said, ``We have tried to come to an agreement with the
greens, but we are not going to put ourselves out of business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, in the provincial interior, dozens of angry loggers
burned a protesters' camp, smashed video equipment and beat up
several environmentalists. Most of the loggers worked for
International Forest Products, which has cut its timber harvest _
and its payroll _ by one-quarter in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   On the coast, green groups want companies to adopt less
destructive logging practices, methods that usually cost more
money. They want to place 41 watersheds permanently off-limits to
logging.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of British Colombia, which owns 95 percent of the
province's land, note that about 300 parks have been added here in
the 1990s, preserving 15,400 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of valley bottoms that will not be logged,''
David Zirnhelt, the provincial minister of forests, said in an
interview. Noting that the allowable cut from the midcoast forest
has been reduced by one-third, he added, ``Two-thirds of the old
growth that is on the landscape today will be there 200 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian environmentalists demand more forest protection,
dismissing many of the new parks here as protection for ``rocks and
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting trees costs money, however. In early September, the
provincial government agreed to pay MacMillan Bloedel $70 million
for the loss of cutting rights on 162 square miles of land set
aside for parks on Vancouver Island. The government had resisted
paying cash because it faces a $600 million budget deficit this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of the forest say there is economic value to
standing trees, and to the rich wildlife they support.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, the Queen of the North, a province-run
ferry, steamed up the inland passage, gliding by forest-cloaked
fjords and waterfalls. Passing Princess Royal Island, the ship
seemed to list to port as tourists with binoculars clogged upper
and lower decks. There, in the shade of an old-growth cedar, a rare
white Kermode, or ``spirit bear,'' stood, crunching on a freshly
caught salmon, its cream-colored jowls streaked red with blood.

BRUINS LOOK FOR THE ANSWER

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Nine games without a win. A record of 0-5-4.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not the way the Bruins thought the season would
begin.
</P>
<P>
   It's their longest stretch without a victory at the start of a
season since they were 0-8-1 in 1964-65. In '64, they beat Chicago,
5-2, in Game No. 10 Nov. 1. The Bruins must beat the Sharks here
Saturday night to avoid an ingnominious spot in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   Offense has been the biggest problem. The Bruins have scored a
14 goals and allowed 23.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns has the remnants of a summer tan, but still
looks ashen. His players are clearly trying but aren't getting the
job done.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, Dmitri Khristich agreed to terms with
the Leafs on a deal that potentially could pay the ex-Bruin $10.34
million over four years. Boston wound up receiving a compensatory
second-round draft pick. Khristich will make $840,000 in salary
this year, to go with a $750,000 signing bonus. Next year, he'll be
bumped up to a $2.5 million salary and a $700,000 bonus. He will
receive $2.5 million in 2001-02, and if the Leafs pick up the
option for 2002-03, he'll earn $2.75 million, plus a $300,000
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Khristich was never going to play in Boston again after
the team said it wouldn't pay him the $2.8 million he was awarded
in arbitration. But there are those on the club who believe the
absence of Khristich, unsigned goalie Byron Dafoe, and center Tim
Taylor (now in New York) are part of the reason the Bruins are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a difficult time believing that,'' said
president/general manager Harry Sinden, when asked if he thought
missing those players was a factor in the club's malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden believes the goaltending of Rob Tallas and John Grahame
has been solid enough to offset the loss of Dafoe. To counter
Khristich, Sinden points to the production from Dave Andreychuk,
who is on a 35-goal pace. In addition, Taylor has been hampered by
appendicitis and a concussion and had 2 goals and 2 assists in 8
games with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said he thought it was a matter of his club finishing
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't score 14 goals in nine games,'' said Sinden.
``You're not going to win many games if you do, or in our case, any
games. We're spending too much time in our own end. You can see the
effort is there and they're really playing their hearts out. This
is not a lazy man's team at all, but somehow we seem caught between
going in and staying out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said when the team gets the lead, it's immensely fragile
and can't hang on. He wasn't blaming anyone and seems convinced
they'll work their way out of it. He said he supports the job Burns
is doing, and if he thought the club had laziness permeating parts
of it, he would make trades. However, right now, the Bruins' boss
seems content to let the team play its way out of its funk.
</P>
<P>
   As for Khristich, Sinden said he's not surprised he signed with
the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, they can't stop themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich levied a few shots at Sinden upon joining Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty mad right after the playoffs finished and Harry
went to the papers and blamed myself and (Jason) Allison because we
lost,'' Khristich told Toronto reporters. ``After that and after
the arbitration, him saying, `I'm not going to pay him,' that made
(for) really bad feelings. The team was fine and we were together,
but we didn't have the right management. I want to see him in the
playoffs this year. He was complaining about my meaningless goals
during the regular season and now they've got no goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich said in his estimation, there's plenty of unhappiness
among the Bruins as a result of their personnel moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will show, but it's not me who lost the playoffs,'' he
said. ``As a team we did pretty good and (Sinden) just had to blame
me because he was preparing for (a contract fight), that's his
problem. A lot of players are not happy with what's happening
there. They gave up on me and Byron just because of contracts and
they didn't get anything. I've heard the guys and the coach are not
happy with the management doing this kind of stuff to the team, not
willing to pay the price to win.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sinden was told Khristich didn't think he was treated
fairly in Boston, Sinden said, ``The feeling is mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, there is a belief among a good number of Bruins
that they are a lesser team because of Khristich's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relying on guys who are not usually in a situation to
get 30-40 goals,'' said defenseman Kyle McLaren. ``It's tough for
them to get going. We're relying on guys who haven't been in that
situation in the NHL before. To have the pressure that they have
here, I think they're still learning that. I'm not going to lie.
Khristich was a huge (factor). Everybody knows it, the guys in here
know it. But we've got to pick it up. We need more guys to step to
the forefront and do more. Sergei (Samsonov) got his first goal
(Wednesday night), that's good. Anson Carter did. But we need
more.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said what has made it difficult was the struggle for
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal scoring is way down from last year (14 as opposed to
24),'' said McLaren. ``We haven't scored four goals in a game yet.
It's a big decline from last year. You can stick it in a closet but
it's not going to go away. Nine games is a young season but . . .
You try to ignore it but you can't. It's something you can't ignore
and it's not going to go away until something is done, until one of
these guys picks it up. If a guy gets 30 goals one year, who's to
say he's going to get 30 the next year? With Khristich basically
you knew it. You knew what you were going to get from him every
single year. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said some of the young players, and members of the top
two lines, are feeling the heat of the increased responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the best checkers in the NHL playing against you,''
he said. ``In the past, Dmitri and (Allison) took most of the
brunt. Everybody else played. Now it's more diverse, there's a lot
more pressure on Joe (Thornton) and Sammy. Even Landon Wilson and
those guys. It's tough in this league to get 20 goals, even 10
goals, and when you lose a guy who gets 30 on a consistent basis
and 70 points, that's a big hole right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played nine games without him already. He's not going to
be back so we can't cry about it. But it's tough. It really is.''

SCIENTISTS FIND WHAT MAY BE OLDEST KNOWN DINOSAUR BONES

<P>
   Scientists have unearthed a trove of fossils in Madagascar,
including the bones of two dinosaurs that may be the oldest ever
found.
</P>
<P>
   The fossils are from the Middle to Late Triassic period, 225
million to 230 million years ago. Together with remains of eight
types of reptiles that were also uncovered, they should help shed
light on this poorly understood period, a time when dinosaurs and
early mammals first began to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a handle on the initial diversification of
all dinosaur lineages,'' said Dr. John J. Flynn, chairman of the
geology department at the Field Museum in Chicago, who found the
fossils beginning in 1996 along with paleontologists from several
other institutions. The dinosaur bones, Flynn said, ``will help
tease apart when it happened, how fast and the processes that
caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs are members of a group called prosauropods,
plant-eating beasts that are early cousins of the sauropod
dinosaurs, the largest land animals that ever lived. The new
dinosaurs have not been named.
</P>
<P>
   The exact age of the fossils is impossible to determine, since
radioisotopic dating has not been possible, Flynn said. Instead,
the researchers have relied on the classic technique of analyzing
the entire fossil record for the find and dating it by the presence
or absence of certain known species. Flynn likened it to trying to
get an approximate date for a photograph of a sports team by noting
the presence or absence of veterans and rookies whose years of
arrival or departure are known.
</P>
<P>
   Though that technique, Flynn said, ``we know that the fossils
are at least as old or older than other dinosaur sites.'' This
includes the sites where scientists found the remains of the oldest
known dinosaurs, Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor, which lived 228
million years ago. The new fossils, he said, are probably about 230
million years old.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the discovery is being published Friday in the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The other fossils that were uncovered may help explain another
little-known aspect of the Triassic period: the early evolution of
mammals. Five of the reptile fossils show evidence of evolving
mammalian features, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The entire fossil find should also provide clues as to how the
ecosystem changed during this period, when the huge land mass known
as Pangea began to fragment into what eventually became continents.
Primitive reptiles ruled the roost at first, Flynn said, but at the
end of the Triassic period, dinosaurs dominated the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, he said, the fossils ``will help us lift the fog
that has shrouded these evolutionary events.''

CLINTON'S SECURITY ADVISER ATTACKS PRECEPTS OF `NEW
ISOLATIONISTS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The White House national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, expanding on an attack initiated by President Clinton, said
Thursday night that ``new isolationists'' who defeated the nuclear
test ban treaty wanted to build ``a fortified fence around
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a policy, which Berger challenged in a speech at the
Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, is dangerous, because it
calls for devastating cuts to foreign assistance, would rely solely
on military defenses and fail to keep to commitments abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new isolationism of 1999 fails to understand precisely
what the old isolationism of 60 years ago failed to understand _
that local conflicts can have global consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still stung by criticism of how the White House handled the test
ban treaty, which was supposed to have been a centerpiece of
Clinton's foreign policy legacy, Berger argued there was a silver
lining in the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes of our engagement in the world have been made
clear,'' he said. ``The lines have been drawn. And an old debate
has begun anew.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton at his news conference last week, Berger did not
specify Republicans as the ``new isolationists,'' saying more
obliquely these beliefs were held by a ``dominant minority in the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that with this speech he hoped to spur a debate about
America's role, ``between leading the world and hunkering down.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Berger's argument was the failure of the ``new
isolationists'' to distinguish between America's power and
America's authority.
</P>
<P>
   There was little question, he suggested, about America's
overwhelming power. ``Power is the ability to compel by force and
sanctions,'' he said. ``There are times we must do so, but as a
final, not a first resort.''
</P>
<P>
   The policies of the isolationists, Berger said, undermined
America's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Authority is the ability to lead, and we depend on it for
virtually everything we try to achieve,'' Berger added. ``Our
authority is built on very different qualities than our power, on
the attractiveness of our values, on the force of our example, on
the credibility of our commitments and on our willingness to work
with and stand by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger listed five precepts of the isolationists and quarreled
with each one. He said the isolationist idea that treaties
represented a threat to American sovereignty and continued
superiority was wrong-headed. ``Never mind that the alternative is
a world with no rules, no verification and no constraints at all,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A second plank of the isolationists was that ``burden sharing is
a one-way street.' Proponents of that idea ``rightly'' insisted,
for example, that the Europeans pay for most of the reconstruction
in the Balkans, because the United States had carried the main
military burden. ``But then they balk at doing our part.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took exception to the notion that ``we can't be a great
country without a great adversary.'' Berger scoffed at what he
called the revival of ``Russophobia'' and of making China ``the new
enemy No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said it was untenable for the isolationists to call for
billions of dollars for defense but ``hardly a penny for
prevention.'' Thus, he said, Clinton had vetoed the foreign
operations bill, which allowed for $2 billion less than the White
House wanted for measures like paying for programs to back up the
Middle East peace effort and safeguarding the Russian nuclear
stockpile.

MIKE TYSON REMAINS A MAN OF CONTRADICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Every time he speaks he seems to contradict himself,
but perhaps that is fitting coming from Mike Tyson, for whom
everything seems to be a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of his desire to be a family man, has his picture on
the cover of Esquire kissing one of his children in a celebration
of Father's Day, then admits to spending far too much time in strip
joints in Phoenix and Las Vegas for a guy with four kids and a wife
2,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of never, ever wanting to see the inside of a courtroom
again, even on television, then says he'd bite a guy in the ring if
he felt threatened and unprotected like he did against Evander
Holyfield two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with a reporter of the likelihood of repeating that
incident one day, and the next he tells a different reporter that
was all just an attempt to sell tickets.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of how celebrity is hurting his marriage, and then puts
himself smack in the middle of that most public stage he has trod
since age 14 by returning to boxing and the headlines again and
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   He is Mike Tyson, a fighter past his prime but still prime time.
But who is the real Tyson? Does anyone know? Does anyone even care?
</P>
<P>
   Is he the Tyson who warmly greeted familiar faces among the
print media last week, faces that have chronicled his rise, fall,
rise, fall, rise . . . well, you get the point . . . or is he the
Tyson who glowered at Orlin Norris after their press conference
Wednesday and then threatened Norris's manager, Scott Woodwirth, as
the they were leaving a ballroom at the MGM Grand?
</P>
<P>
   Is he both? Is he neither?
</P>
<P>
   Can he still fight? Will he ever again bite?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Nobody knows, which is the reason the public still
finds him fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   That is how it has been with Tyson, it seems, ever since he
gained the public's consciousness when he became the youngest
heavyweight champion back in 1986. Always the same. Always more
questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   So it remains this morning, 36 hours before his showdown at the
MGM Grand Garden Arena with a 34-year-old former cruiserweight who
is a 12-1 underdog yet is still given a chance because no one is
quite sure who Mike Tyson is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing with this guy is, he's got to believe it and
have no doubts,'' longtime fight trainer Lou Duva said of Tyson.
``If his confidence is where it should be, I think you'll be
shocked by how good he looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but is it where it should be? Does anyone know,
including Duva's son-in-law and Tyson's trainer, Tommy Brooks?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's sense of confidence and Mike's ability depends on him
being able to perform, and being elusive, having the security of
knowing that the opponent isn't going to hit him, and he can hit
the opponent back whenever he wants, without just walking straight
in and trying to nail the guy,'' said Jay Bright, Tyson's boyhood
friend who is working on his second tour as one of Tyson's
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the true confidence comes from, not from anybody
saying anything, or blowing a lot of hot air. His true confidence
comes from his security in his boxing ability, and that's what I've
been working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this Brooks says that his fighter will knock Norris
cold one way or another, and that ``Mike has to believe in what
he's doing and believe in his ability as a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously so. But does he? Like everything else about him, that
depends on when you ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my focus is much better than it was for (Frans)
Botha,'' said Tyson, referring to the fight in which he lost four
straight rounds and was on his way to losing a fifth when he landed
one punch that left Botha twitching on the floor long enough to
make further rounds unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming out of a much more serene setting for this fight,''
said Tyson. ``I feel totally different. My timing and speed are
much better. Orlin Norris is a good fighter, but I don't care how
well he's prepared. I'm prepared to knock him out cold.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds pretty confident, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, but then he told the Los Angeles Times that he would
bite again if he feels under siege and admitted trying to break
Botha's arm in the first round of their fight in January. A day
later insisted, ``I was just talking smack. Just hyping the fight.
I was trying to sell some tickets. The Nevada State Athletic
Commission knew I wasn't serious. They knew the trauma I went
through. I won't do that in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never jeopardize my career, my life, again. It was
just fight talk. Anybody who knows the adversity I experienced
because of that ordeal would know I was just blowing off hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   That's reassuring. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Will he bite, can he fight? Is he the fighter he used to be a
decade ago or is he the guy who sleepwalked through much of the
1990s, fighting only 58 rounds, an average of 5.8 rounds a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to fight,'' Tyson said when asked to speculate
if the Tyson of 1988 still lurks somewhere inside him. ``I've put
in the work. I lost the weight (an estimated 60 pounds). I'm in the
perfect frame of mind to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first fight (back from his suspension) I was
affected by ring rust but that got it out of me. But who cares if
I'm rusty? If I'm rusty I'm rusty. I'll still look sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   He has looked anything but in his last three fights, which in
fairness have been spread over the last four years, which is part
of the problem in trying to decipher who he is and what he has
left.
</P>
<P>
   In those fights he has lost twice to Holyfield, who beat him
senseless in their first fight and snapped his mind and forced him
to be disqualified in the second. That led to more than a year's
suspension and fines and lost revenue estimated at $20 million or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Botha fight, which he appeared ready to lose until
he landed the bomb that saved him as it has so many other times in
life. But before he could build on that, he was back in jail
following a fender-bender accident during which he assaulted two
elderly men and was sentenced to a Maryland jail for six months.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was released, Tyson had ballooned to 274 pounds,
then three times delayed this fight before finally agreeing to get
in with the light-hitting Norris.
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly a recipe for confidence building, either his
own or the public's. Yet twice this week Tyson decked his sparring
partners and was throwing the kind of whistling combinations in the
gym that were once his trademark. Those combinations have not been
seen in the ring for a decade, however, and may not be seen
Saturday night, either, because Tyson has looked good in the gym
before yet been unable to carry it into the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Too often this decade he has abandoned the daring but dangerous
style he was taught as a kid by Cus D'Amato, a style that requires
he work within an opponent's range and move his head and body
quickly enough to avoid punches while still being in position to
land. That requires a boldness he seems to no longer possess,
instead favoring a clumsy but safer search for a one-punch
knockout.
</P>
<P>
   That more plodding style still has worked over many of the
game's frauds because even today Tyson remains the most dangerous
knockout artist in boxing, but it was also seen as an unconscious
acknowledgment that he knows fear in the ring now and cannot
control it.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson seldom seems comfortable or relaxed when he's boxed in
recent years and never has he looked like the fighter he was the
night he destroyed Michael Spinks in 91 seconds in '88. Hence,
despite the hype and the hard-hits in the gym this week, mystery
still shrouds him as the second fight of his fifth comeback
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery for which even he doesn't seem to be sure of the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't fought in 2 1/2 years (before the Botha fight),''
Tyson said. ``That wasn't a good experience, but it was a
sensational ending. Not too many people could start over as many
times as I have.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but there's another contradiction, perhaps the last for
Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many other people could start over as many times as he
has. Then again, not too many people ever had to.

PLANTE GETS OPPORTUNITY WHILE REPLACING INJURED NIEUWENDYK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stanley Cup sat in the middle of the room.
The champagne bottles were empty. It was 4:30 the morning after,
and the party had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   In that intoxicating moment, Derek Plante stood and poured out
heartfelt thanks to his teammates like the bubbly that had flowed
all night.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Plante, who had been traded from Buffalo 98
days earlier, became a part of the Stars. It is now that he becomes
a player for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Nieuwendyk was sidelined by a back injury Wednesday,
Plante took over the role of second-line center. Nieuwendyk, who
missed Wednesday's victory against Edmonton, had a magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) test yesterday to determine the extent of
his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Nieuwendyk is listed as day to day, Plante is
preparing as if he is going to play tonight against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just come to play every day, I guess, hoping I get a chance
to play,'' Plante said. ``Unfortunately, Joe got hurt, but for me,
I've got a chance to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars already were missing five regular players because of
injury when Nieuwendyk hobbled off the ice after Wednesday's
pregame skate. The Starshad come to expect the worst this season
but were unprepared for this blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nieuwendyk's one blew me away,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``We weren't ready for that. We had no idea. There was no
buildup to it or anything. It just, boom, it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante went into the pregame skate expecting to be a healthy
scratch for the fourth consecutive game. He came out of the pregame
skate on the No. 2 line with Jamie Langenbrunner and Aaron Gavey on
the wings. Plante, an offensive support player, earned his keep by
setting up the second goal in the Stars' 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Plante was not even sure his future was
with the Stars. Now, he could have the Stars' immediate future in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek is a very skilled player with a great sense for the
game,'' Langenbrunner said. ``I just think he needs an opportunity.
That's what he's been looking for. When he came into the league, he
was playing a lot at Buffalo and scoring a lot and became a
big-time player for them. He found hard times there, and I think
he's having a hard time finding his role so to speak, a place where
he can play just to get him some confidence. When he plays with
confidence, I think he's a very effective player.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante is not Joe Nieuwendyk. He does not have a Conn Smythe
Trophy as the playoff MVP as Nieuwendyk earned in last season's
Stanley Cup run. He admits he does not command respect as
Nieuwendyk does.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not without skills. In five full seasons with the
Sabres, he scored 56 points twice and had another season of 53
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I can play if I get out there and get to play a
fair amount and get to get back into rhythm,'' said Plante, 28.
``You become a little bit erratic if you don't play. I've been in
and out of the lineup, and that's a little difficult sometimes,
too, to get anything constant going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars traded a second-round choice for Plante last March,
but he played in only 10 games. He did not appear in the Western
Conference finals or in the Stanley Cup Finals against his former
team. That did not stop him from a heart-felt acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew much about Derek even after we traded for him,''
Hitchcock said. ``When we won in Buffalo, Derek really endeared
himself into this group by what he said. He brought himself closer
to the group, because he said some things that I even remember what
he said now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just talked about what it meant to him personally to be
part of the group, what it meant to him to be able to learn about
playing with an organization, things like that. It meant a lot. He
spoke eloquently. He kind of stopped the party with what he said. I
don't even know if he recognizes what he did, but it was
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only he can be as impressive on the ice.

SANDERS NOT CONCERNED WITH TALK FROM REDSKINS RECEIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders feels about the
talk from Redskins receiver Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook.
They're saying they will not only challenge his All-Pro reputation
Sunday, but beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whose ability to trash talks is on par with his ability
to play cornerback, refused to be engaged in a war of words with
the receivers. What else are they going to say, Sanders asked.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, talk from receivers before the game is nothing new. He
said he would put more stock in it if it were coming from the
various quarterbacks, who have combined to throw two passes in his
direction the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always like that before the game,'' Sanders said. ``We go
through this same thing, the same scenario, the same old talk, the
same old walk. Until you get out there on the field and see No. 21
sitting out there on that island, things are different. It has
nothing to do with the way they \RWestbrook and Connell\S feel. You
need to talk to the quarterback who's making the throws. All
receivers feel they are open on every play.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   The only injury concern heading into Sunday's game against the
Redskins is free safety George Teague, who missed his second day of
practice with a strained neck and remains doubtful. Backup Izell
Reese will start if Teague can't go.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Hennings (strained neck) and Sanders
(sprained ankle), who both missed practice Wednesday, returned to
practice yesterday and should be ready for the Redskins.

QUALITY DAY CARE, EARLY, IS TIED TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE AS ADULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Wording change in the lede; adds 2 grafs after graf 6; subs

 (ATTN: N.C., Ala., N.Y.)  (dal) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Good early-childhood education has a powerful
influence that lasts into young adulthood, affecting things like
reading and mathematics skills and even the timing of childbearing,
researchers announced on Thursday, citing the first study ever to
track participants from infancy to age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Those who received high-quality day care consistently
outperformed their peers who did not on both cognitive and academic
tests, and also were more likely to attend college or hold
high-skill jobs, the researchers found. The program also helped
participants' parents, with teen-age mothers far more likely to
have completed high school after their babies received the
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called efficacy question, whether you can affect
development in the preschool years, is resoundingly answered in the
affirmative,'' Craig T. Ramey, director of the landmark study, said
at a news conference at the Department of Education. ``It has
become crystal clear that if you wait until age 3 or 4 you are
going to be dealing with a series of delays and deficits that will
put you in remedial programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, called the Abecedarian Project, involved 111 poor
African-American families in Chapel Hill, N.C., whose infants were
medically healthy but, demographically, at risk for failure in
school and beyond. Half the children were randomly assigned to
full-time day-care from infancy to age 5, while the others received
only nutritional supplements and some social work. They attended
comparable public schools from kindergarten on.
</P>
<P>
   With low adult-child ratios and a stable, professional staff,
the educational program consisted of a series of 200 simple games
focused on language development, starting with visual stimulus for
tiny infants and leading to scavenger hunts and mazes for older
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians and psychologists hope to use the barrage of new
data to persuade Congress and the states to broaden access to care
for poor families, particularly those on welfare, and to improve
conditions and curriculum in the current cadre of day-care centers.
The announcement comes amid increased attention to the issue, with
a group of experts scheduled to meet here next week to applaud
France's universal preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newest findings will not be published until the
spring, nearly 300 peer-reviewed articles based on the study, which
began in 1972, have already appeared in a variety of academic
journals.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been praised by Hillary Rodham Clinton and other
advocates of early childhood education, but criticized by other
authorities who have attacked its research methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most child care in America is borderline lousy and, at best,
safe but not developmentally stimulating,'' said Michael H. Levine,
who oversees early childhood development projects for Carnegie
Corp. in New York. ``Whether or not there's a government solution
to providing high-quality care for all working families or not,
there certainly needs to be a more balanced responsibility for
responding to this research.''
</P>
<P>
   Abecedarian _ the word, echoing the ABCs, means novice learner _
found that children in the intensive educational program were more
successful than their peers by virtually every measure:
</P>
<P>
   _ 35 percent of those in the day-care program attended a
four-year college before their 21st birthday, compared with 14
percent of the control group.
</P>
<P>
   _ At age 21, twice as many of the day-care graduates _ 40
percent _ were still in school; 65 percent of those who received
the intervention either had a good job or were in college, compared
with 40 percent of the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer of the participants in the child-care program had
children of their own by age 21; those who did became parents, on
average, past their 19th birthday, while the parents in the other
group were about 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ By age 15, twice as many of the children in the control group
had been placed in special education classes as their peers who
received the educational day care. Only 30 percent of the day-care
children had to repeat a grade in school, compared with 56 percent
of the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ While test scores were below average for both groups and
dropped over time, those in the child-care program kept an edge of
about 5 percentage points through age 21. The gap in IQ, however,
fell from about 17 points at age 3 to just 5 points by age 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ The study did not find significant differences in criminal
activity between the two groups, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most intensely studied group of children on
earth,'' Ramey said, noting that researchers collected about 10,000
pieces of data about each child each year _ everything from viruses
and bacteria in their respiratory systems to their participation in
organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey, now a professor of psychology, pediatrics and
neurobiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and his
colleagues at the University of North Carolina, are vigorous
advocates of early childhood education. &UR;  &LR;  They hope to continue
tracking the participants to age 28 or 29. The research has been
financed by the Department of Education and the State of North
Carolina, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The Abecedarian results echo results of several similar studies
that indicate educational day care improves academic achievement
and social behaviors. It is the first program that began with
infants _ aged 6 weeks to 4 months _ and followed them to
adulthood, and shows more significant gaps at age 21 than a similar
project, based in Michigan, that began with developmentally
disadvantaged children aged 3 or 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important is that it's not just any child care,
that it is high-quality early care and intervention,'' said Augusta
S. Kappner, president of Bank Street College of Education in New
York, who recently toured France with a group of 15 educators to
study that country's program of universal free preschool. ``What is
high quality? Usually you're talking about the really important
factors, such as the qualifications of the staff, the constancy of
the staff, the quality of the curriculum, group size, parent
participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abecedarian Project, based at the Frank Porter Graham Child
Development Center in Chapel Hill, had staff with qualifications
akin to public-school teachers, and virtually no turnover. Ratios
ranged from 1 adult to 3 children to 1 to 7, depending on the
children's ages.
</P>
<P>
   The learning games, such as waving a scarf over an infant until
he grabs it, or leading a toddler to identify like items among
several pieces of silverware, are integrated into a high-stimulus
day of art projects and playground visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the learning games happen during mealtimes, they
happen during diapering, they happen when you're going outdoors,''
explained Joseph Sparling, co-author of the curriculum, which was
published in two books. ``You could hardly distinguish them from
good adult-child interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Abecedarian cost the equivalent of $11,000 per child per year in
today's dollars, but researchers said similar results could likely
be accomplished for less, since there were extra expenses
associated with being a demonstration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that we can't afford this is absolutely bogus _
we get what we pay for,'' Ramey said. ``We're the richest country
on the face of the earth, we're the richest we've ever been. We're
not No. 1 in the world in education, in health care, in social
services.''  &QL;

THE SLOW ROAD TO BANKING OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than 20 years, financial service firms
have tried to steer an overhaul of the nation's banking laws
through Congress, only to get lost each time in the legislative
maze. This year, the path has not been any less befuddling.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have passed bills that would tear down
Depression-era walls that generally keep banks, brokerages and
insurance companies out of each other's lines of business. But
lawmakers were still working Thursday night to settle a dispute
over one provision with President Clinton, and they seemed far from
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said the provision would prompt a veto,
because it weakens an existing law that encourages banks to make
loans in low-income and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been closer,'' said Dan Zielinsky, spokesman for
the American Insurance Association. ``The sides are almost so close
that they can see the whites of each others eyes.'' And yet,
lobbyists for financial services firms acknowledged that there was
a strong chance they would fail yet again.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators, sometimes joined by Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, have been working for three days to
settle their differences, and their talks continued into Thursday
evening. ``We're at a very dicey stage right now,'' said Senator
John F. Kerry, one of the lawmakers working on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would replace the laws passed after the stock market
crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that generally prevent
banks, brokerages and insurance firms from merging with each other.
Allowing these firms to buy each other, say supporters of the bill,
would create financial service ``supermarkets'' that could offer
customers more services, operate more efficiently and compete with
the megabanks of Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Current US law does not treat each sector of the finance
industry equally. Banks can buy brokerages, for example, but
brokerages cannot buy banks. The new law will ``level the playing
field'' among the various sectors, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   One major US deal, the $70 billion merger of Citicorp and
Travelers Group Inc., is credited with pushing lawmakers to work
harder on an overhaul. That deal could not fully take effect under
existing laws, and its announcement last year was considered a
signal that the business world had become impatient with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people who support much of the bill are unhappy with
two provisions: one involving customer privacy and one involving
bank commitments to low-income and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Under a provision already agreed to by lawmakers and Clinton,
personal information about customers could be shared among the
banking, stock brokerage and insurance arms of a single company.
The company could also share that information with other firms,
though customers would be able to ``opt out'' and prevent that type
of disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say the information-sharing will allow them to
better serve customers. The company could market homeowner's
insurance, for example, to a person who asks its banking unit for a
home mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates wanted the law to require companies to ask
customers before sharing information. They held out hope Thursday
that White House would reverse course and demand tougher privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The second major debate involves the Community Reinvestment Act,
a 22-year-old law that requires banks that collect deposits in
low-income and minority communities to make sure they offer loans
in those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who leads the Senate
Banking Committee, is a critic of the CRA, arguing that it gives
community groups too much power to demand cash payments from banks
and commitments to loan programs for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming the group, Gramm has criticized the Boston-based
Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, which has persuaded banks
across the country to back its loan program, aimed at low- and
moderate-income home buyers. NACA now closes 300 to 400 loans a
month and manages $3.7 billion in loan commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm wants to revise the CRA so that the government audits
small banks for compliance every five years, rather than the 18
months to 24 months in current practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he was ``fighting extremely hard'' in private
negotiations to find an agreement on the CRA changes. ``We ought to
be able to embrace financial modernization as well as protect the
CRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Marks, chief executive of NACA, said that public
disclosure of his group's agreements with banks would have a
``chilling effect'' on bank commitments to loan programs for low-
and moderate-income home buyers.

MATTEL'S EARNINGS TUMBLE BY 42 PERCENT IN THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mattel Inc. posted bleak third-quarter financial results
Thursday, reporting a 42 percent earnings drop caused by a huge
loss at a software company it spent $3.8 billion to acquire only
five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall stemmed in part from weak international sales. But
it was mostly a result of a $105 million deficit at the Learning
Co., which Mattel purchased in May in hopes of moving more
aggressively into the consumer software business. The unit suffered
from a laundry list of problems, from hefty product returns to a
failed licensing deal. It had been expected to earn $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the world's largest toy maker warned investors to expect a
disappointing performance in the current fourth quarter as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the all-important holiday selling period, Mattel said it
would probably earn 70 cents to 80 cents a share instead of the 95
cents consensus estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson
Financial. The company had profits from operations of $1.20 a share
in the corresponding period last year. Mattel attributed the likely
profit erosion to the lingering effects of the Learning Co.
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, Mattel's profits plummeted to $135.3
million, or 32 cents a share, from $233.8 million, or 54 cents,
before $65.1 million in after-tax charges in the period a year ago.
Revenue declined 3 percent, to $1.83 billion, from $1.88 billion.
The results met analysts sharply revised estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of the year, Mattel lost $63.9
million, after $269.7 million in one-time charges in contrast to
earnings of $111.3 million, or 27 cents, in the period a year
earlier. Revenues were essentially flat at $3.74 billion compared
to $3.80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Management had warned investors on Oct. 4 that the quarter would
be dismal, prompting analysts to pare their 67-cents-a-share
earnings estimate. Angry shareholders sold the stock, sending it
down 30 percent, to a 52-week low of $11.875.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has since been slapped with shareholder lawsuits claiming
investors were misled about the health of the company. Mattel
declined to comment on the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the stock, which has not substantially rebounded since
the earnings warning, held steady, to close at $13.125, down 18.75
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some analysts and institutional investors said they
were stunned that Thursday's announcements did not include
management changes. ``I think management at the Learning Company
has to be held accountable,'' said Martin Romm, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But asked specifically about possible management changes at the
unit during a conference call with analysts Thursday, Jill E.
Barad, Mattel's chairman and chief executive, said, ``In terms of
management changes, there are none and I will not speak of any
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and institutional investors say leadership change
is needed at the very top of Mattel and criticize Ms. Barad for her
overall management of the company.
</P>
<P>
   By so sharply revising expectations Thursday, for instance, ``I
think what Jill Barad is trying to do is get expectations to such a
low level that they can ultimately beat those low expectations,''
said Erik Gustafson, a senior portfolio manager at Stein Roe &AMP;
Farnham Inc., which owns 3.77 million Mattel shares. He added that
though the company might be better served by a leader with a
broader set of skills, the board ``is unwilling to make tough
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad declined to comment through a spokesman, who said she
continued to have the full support of the board.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, though, said a shake-up at the Learning Co., at
least, might still be imminent. ``I think the situation is still
evolving,'' said Jill Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney. ``This is just a progress report more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad said in a statement that Mattel was ``most
disappointed in developments at the Learning Co.,'' but she sought
to assure investors that the core business remained strong. She
said domestic sales of the Barbie, Fisher-Price, toy vehicles and
American Girl brands were robust. But analysts said that because of
earlier surprises, investors had lost all confidence in Ms. Barad's
pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a management-credibility issue here,'' Romm
of Credit Suisse First Boston said. ``They have to restore the
confidence of the investment community and shareholders and that's
going to take a long time.'' &QL;

NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL SCRUTINIZES REVIEW RULES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Challenged for allowing researchers with a financial interest in
medicines review their effectiveness in its pages, the New England
Journal of Medicine took the extraordinary step Thursday of posting
on its Web site two letters about its policy governing potential
conflicts of interest for contributors.
</P>
<P>
   While most medical journals accept articles from authors with
ties to the drug industry, since 1990 the New England Journal has
been more stringent, with a policy against publishing editorials or
review articles written by researchers who had accepted money from
manufacturers of the drug or device reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But the journal has violated its own strict policy numerous
times in the last several years, according to a Los Angeles Times
article Thursday. In eight of 36 ``Drug Therapy'' articles examined
by the Times that were printed in NEJM since 1997, researchers had
financial links to companies that marketed treatments reviewed in
the articles, even though that was not disclosed to the reader.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sept. 23 issue of the NEJM, Dr. Vera Price of the
University of California at San Francisco, wrote a favorable review
of hair-loss treatments, with no disclosure in the journal of her
financial ties to companies that market some of the popular drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the letters posted Thursday on the magazine's Web site is
from Price to the NEJM editor saying that she was allowed to write
the article even after she had disclosed her commercial ties in
writing to the NEJM. The other letter is by journal editors
accepting responsibility for the departure from policy.
</P>
<P>
   Interim editor-in-chief Marcia Angell said the editors will go
back and talk to past authors of review articles about whether
conflicts-of-interest should have prohibited them from writing a
review article. The strict disclosure policy won't change, said
Angell, but the journal plans to change procedures so its practice
conforms with its policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, NEJM also acknowledged that it had run a review of a
book on environmental carcinogens by the medical director at
chemical giant W. R. Grace &AMP; Co., and in 1996 published a favorable
editorial on anti-obesity drugs by authors who were paid
consultants for companies selling one of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main question is if the grant support is major,'' Angell
said in an interview. She said that it is the journal's policy to
allow review articles by writers who have had minor support or past
consultancies from affected companies, and the NEJM has not
disclosed those links. ``Almost everyone at one time or another was
an ad hoc consultant for a company. It would really be impossible
to exclude everyone who has ever been a consultant,'' Angell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alastair J.J. Wood of Vanderbilt University, the editor of
the ``Drug Therapy'' articles, said the journal has different
conflict policies for original research articles and for review
articles like the ``Drug Therapy'' ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the former, if the research is paid for by a company, the
researcher is allowed to write the article while disclosing the
link. However, such a connection would prohibit someone from
writing an editorial or a review article for journal because it is
the opinion of the reviewer that matters, said Wood. ``We are
trying to see if the content of the article would influence a
financial gain,'' said Wood, who sends a letter asking for authors
to volunteer possible conflicts-of-interest before they write a
piece.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the stringent policy is ``extraordinarily hard,''
said Wood. ``It's hard to know what's minor and major.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Price case, ``there have been some misinterpretations,
but we in Boston also reviewed it and OK'd it,'' said Angell, who
said that she is making some changes in procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Angell said that ``effective immediately,'' potential authors
will have to list all origins of grant support and past
consultations, including funding from the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see how recent is recent, and how past is past,''
Angell said.
</P>
<P>
   Another change is that the journal will disclose even a
researcher's minor grant support from a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's pizza money, so readers can decide,'' Angell
said. The NEJM Web site is www.nejm.org.

BUSINESS, NOT WORDS, IN THE LULL BEFORE THE STORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the Nielsen ratings were based strictly on the
Yankees' watching, then Atlanta's Game 6 victory over the Mets in
the National League Championship Series Tuesday would have had
complete viewership. In their homes in Manhattan, in Westchester
and New Jersey and Long Island, the Yankees were all watching, and
the Braves' aggressiveness on the bases made a strong impression on
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' success _ or failure _ at preventing the Braves
from running freely, stealing second and third, will be a critical
factor in the World Series, which starts Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said Thursday at Yankee Stadium
that Orlando Hernandez will start Game 1, against the Braves' Tom
Glavine, in Atlanta; David Cone faces Greg Maddux in Game 2; Andy
Pettitte will pitch against the Braves' Kevin Millwood in Game 3,
when the series shifts to Yankee Stadium, and Roger Clemens will
throw against John Smoltz in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees worked for about two hours Thursday, position
players and pitchers taking batting practice, and they will fly to
Atlanta Friday morning and practice at Turner Field in the
afternoon. Before their workout Friday, the Yankees' scouting staff
will brief them on the intelligence gathered in the last six weeks.
Thick orange binders have been filled with pages of information on
where the Braves' hitters tend to drive the ball, what they like to
swing at, and what Glavine, Maddux and the rest like to throw in
specific situations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees saw the Braves swipe five bases against the Mets
on Tuesday, and they are well aware that Atlanta _ attempting to
compensate for the loss of Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez from its
lineup _ is committed to being aggressive on the bases and
challenging the defense. Two other significant factors will be the
Yankees' ability to exploit the free-swinging and sometimes
undisciplined Atlanta hitters, as well as the Yankees' success in
coping with a Braves bullpen steeped in left-handed relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stole 14 bases in 6 games against the Mets, and have
18 steals in 10 post-season games. ``Their entire lineup runs with
the exception of their catcher,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the
Yankees' pitching coach. ``It looks like a very good base-running
team; they're going to be aggressive, and we know that.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that the Yankees' starting pitchers sometimes
struggled to hold runners on base this year. American League teams
are passive on the basepaths, by and large, but Hernandez
surrendered 19 stolen bases, Cone 22. Even Pettitte, who has an
exceptional pickoff move, began having problems containing base
stealers after runners learned that it's easy to swipe third on his
slow delivery to home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, Cone and Clemens do not have good pickoff moves. What
they will do, said catcher Joe Girardi, is try to disturb the
timing of the base runners. Cone and Hernandez will often hold the
ball longer, stand on the mound and wait, poised to pitch, and they
will bob their heads, to distract the runner. Clemens will throw to
first base repeatedly, over and over, ignoring the jeers of fans so
long as he can force a runner to dive back to first repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   But Stottlemyre doesn't want his pitchers to become obsessed
with holding runners close and reduce their focus on making a good
pitch. The Yankees' philosophy, in calling pitches, is to ignore
the presence of the runner and make the best pitch possible to
retire the batter rather than just throw fastballs to increase the
chances of throwing out someone trying to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to still be comfortable in what you throw, even when
you're holding runners on,'' Stottlemyre said. ``We're hoping we
can stop their running game by not allowing runners on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre thought the Yankees did ``a fairly good job'' of
slowing Boston's running game in the American League Championship
Series. The Braves will be a far greater challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is like the Texas Rangers, capable of generating mass
numbers of runs; the Braves slugged 197 home runs, fourth-best in
the National League and more than the Yankees (193). But the
Braves, like the Rangers, are sometimes too aggressive. They ranked
third in the league in strikeouts, and their average of 3.56
pitches per plate appearance was far less than the league median
(3.71).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' pitching staff has been able to take advantage of
that sort of aggressiveness in the post-season, when their starters
are armed with reams of scouting information _ Andruw Jones will
swing at anything _ and the type of control needed to capitalize on
the reports. ``I really feel like we probably do that as well as
anybody,'' Stottlemyre said. ``We get great information from our
scouting department, and it's up to us to put that in use. We have
risen to the occasion pretty well in the post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who averaged six runs per game during the regular
season, scored twice in six playoff games against the Yankees in
1998 and '99, while continually flailing at pitches just off the
fringes of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones is a tremendous threat, but he averaged 3.64
pitches per plate appearance, an extremely low figure for a batter
with 126 walks, and had 94 strikeouts. Brian Jordan, who bats
behind Jones, averaged just 3.51 pitches per plate appearance, and
struck out 81 times. Gerald Williams, the Atlanta leadoff hitter,
is notoriously aggressive, and the No. 2 batter, Bret Boone,
accumulated just 45 walks and 112 strikeouts, the sign of an
anxious hitter. They all have weaknesses the Yankees will try to
exploit.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' bullpen is blessed with three established
left-handed relievers, in the closer John Rocker and the set-up men
Mike Remlinger and Terry Mulholland _ and the Yankees have had
problems against left-handers all year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill's .190 average against left-handers was the lowest
for any regular player in the American League, Bernie Williams'
right-handed swing has been hampered by the soreness in his left
shoulder, and even Derek Jeter _ a right-handed batter _ hit 84
points lower against left-handers than right-handers this season.
Jimy Williams, the Boston manager, exploited this weakness in the
championship series, calling on the left-hander Rheal Cormier to
pitch to everyone from Jeter to Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But Cormier was Williams' only left-hander; Bobby Cox, the
Atlanta manager, has three, and the Yankees' lineup is heavy with
left-handed hitters. After the sixth inning, Cox figures to call on
his left-handers against the Yankees, and could have great success.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker held left-handed hitters to a .140 average during the
regular season. They batted .205 against Remlinger. Mulholland was
slightly better against left-handed hitters (.290) than
right-handed ones (.299). The Yankees need to avoid situations in
which they have to come back in the late innings, because the
matchups are so unfavorable.

AIKMAN SAYS COWBOYS' OFFENSE HURTS FOR CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Troy Aikman admitted yesterday that back-to-back
road losses by identical 13-10 scores have eroded the confidence of
the players on the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this whole league is about; it's about playing
with confidence,'' the Cowboys quarterback said. ``That's what we
have to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's hard to make a ``first down'' with ``chin down''.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a panic button located somewhere in Valley
Ranch, it isn't being pushed by owner Jerry Jones, who understands
how confidence can be lost in business, in life or on the football
field over a matter of a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something doesn't work, we look in the mirror and
second-guess ourselves. That's as human as breathing,'' Jones said.
``That doesn't surprise me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it has happened to some of Jones' most elite
players who represent the biggest chunk of his payroll _ the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said yesterday that he still believes in the Chan Gailey
offense; that most Cowboys players consider Sunday's game against
Washington a must-win situation (although Aikman added that these
same players also know that there are 10 games remaining after
Sunday); and that while everyone is working extra hard to get the
offense on track this week, there is no guarantee that anyone has
found the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that anybody has the answer,'' said Aikman, who
said he has had input into meetings this week with Gailey and
quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown, at times, that we're capable of doing what we did
\R541 yards total offense and 41 points against Washington Sept.
12\S, but we certainly haven't done it over the last two weeks,''
Aikman said. ``When you don't go out and do it, it certainly tends
to take away from your confidence as a group.
</P>
<P>
   So, he concluded, ``we have to go out and play consistently and
have some success, so that this group can start playing with some
confidence again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the chicken-and-egg theory. Which comes first?
</P>
<P>
   How do the Cowboys go about jump-starting their confidence on
offense to be able to break this two-game skid and start winning
again?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question. I don't know if there is any one way
to do it,'' Aikman replied. ``We've gone back and looked at what
we've done well, and we're trying to focus in on those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, in their past two games combined (300 yards vs.
Philadelphia, 274 yards vs. the New York Giants) had only 33 yards
more than they rolled up in their season-opening victory at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Cowboys have scored 21 fewer points in two games
combined (10 each against the Eagles and Giants) than they scored
against the Redskins in that 41-35 opener that was decided in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has made the decision this week to streamline the game
plan for Sunday and try to strike a happy medium with the running
and passing games. The Giants stuffed the Cowboys' running game
Monday night with the run blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what has been decided to try to correct some of the
problems that we've had, and I'm in favor of that,'' Aikman said.
``Offense is so much playing with confidence, playing with timing.
The execution part is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose any of that, it becomes very difficult to have any
kind of success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gailey offense _ now 22 games old, including four games in
which the opposition has scored 13 points or less and ``won'' _
seems to be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say, if you have to have somebody tinker with your
offense, Chan Gailey is the right man to do it,'' Jones said
yesterday. ``If you need to call a doctor, in my opinion, he's the
one I'd call.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Aikman: ``Based on what has happened the last two weeks
makes this game just that \Rmuch\S more important. If we're going
into this game 5-0 \Rinstead of 3-2\S, then the dynamics of the
game changes a little bit, even though it shouldn't. You go out to
win every single ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he want the players inside the Cowboys' locker room to
consider this a must-win situation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone does,'' Aikman continued. ``Of course, the
only real must-win situation is when you get into the playoffs ...
but this is an important game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the question everybody seems to be asking this week,
Aikman concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that it's frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``How frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   ``''Very'' frustrating.''

ADVERSITY BRINGS OUT BEST IN BRAVES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves are deflecting Team of the Decade
questions like so many foul tips off a baseball bat, professing
indifference to the opportunity to be designated baseball's best of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares? We're in the World Series and the bottom line is we
want to win,'' Braves outfielder Brian Jordan said Wednesday, in
between batting-practice cuts at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   But it is actually the Braves' fault that such inquiries are
being made. If their play in just a few of the previous eight
post-seasons had matched their brilliance during those regular
seasons, they would already be wearing the unofficial crown,
regardless of what happens in this World Series matchup with the
Yankees, which begins Saturday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox Wednesday named the left-hander Tom
Glavine as the Game 1 starter, followed by Greg Maddux in Game 2 on
Sunday, and Kevin Millwood and John Smoltz in the first two games
at Yankee Stadium next week. Cox also said Smoltz, a starter his
whole career, would be used as a reliever on Saturday, if
necessary. Smoltz pitched twice in relief during the National
League Championship Series against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   While names like Glavine, Maddux and Smoltz are familiar, this
edition of the Braves is different from most of its predecessors,
certainly the 1996 group that fumbled a two-games-to-none lead in
losing the World Series to the Yankees in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming season-ending injuries to Andres Galarraga, Javy
Lopez and Kerry Ligtenberg to win a major league-best 103 games,
and playing fantastically when the division title was on the line
in August and September, has provided the Braves with more
chemistry and resilience than they had three years ago. Thirty-one
times this season they gained a victory in their last at-bat, and
they showed grit in outlasting the diehard Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot closer as a team, a lot tighter,'' Chipper Jones
said. ``We didn't have a lot of injuries in '96. We didn't have a
lot of adversity to come through. This year, all of the adversity
has brought us a lot closer as a ball club. I think if we hadn't
had all those injuries, to be honest with you, we might be sitting
at home right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this team is stronger mentally than the club that
collapsed in 1996, losing three straight games in Atlanta,
including Game 4 in which a home run by the Yankees' Jim Leyritz
helped erase a 6-0 lead, Jones was frank: ``Without a doubt. We
played a lot of close games this year. We didn't clinch the first
week of September. We clinched really late in September, so we were
pretty accustomed to a playoff-type atmosphere before we got into
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years past, we've clinched the first week of September and
taken a couple of weeks off, trying to get everybody healthy. And
it's hard to flip that switch again once you get to the
post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   While these Braves are not as offensively imposing as the 1996
team, they are more potent in other areas. Their bullpen, led by
the ornery closer, John Rocker, is wicked, particularly with Cox at
times employing his starters in relief. The earned-run average of
Atlanta's bullpen (3.52) was better than that of its staff full of
aces (3.83).
</P>
<P>
   Besides the relief corps, the Braves boast better defense and
bench play than they did in 1996. Lopez's backup, Eddie Perez,
played solidly in the second half of the season and was the most
valuable player of the NLCS The Braves have also received clutch
contributions from the 40-year-old Otis Nixon and the 35-year-old
Ozzie Guillen, as well as solid innings from Brian Hunter, Keith
Lockhart and Howard Battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has picked it up,'' said Andruw Jones, who drew the
game-winning walk against the Mets' Kenny Rogers in Game 6 of the
league championship series. ``A lot of guys have become heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Braves insist on being called the underdogs of
this Series. But when the clubs met in a three-game series at
Yankee Stadium just after the All-Star Game break, the Braves won
the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   They did some remarkable things, the most impressive being their
shelling of the Yankees' extraordinary closer, Mariano Rivera. With
two outs in the ninth inning, Jones, who homered in his first two
at-bats in the 1996 World Series, drove a Rivera fastball over the
fence for a three-run homer that led to a 10-7 Braves' victory. It
was one of only two home runs hit off Rivera this season and the
last of his four blown saves. He has surrendered just one run
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we can grasp from that series back in New York is
that we did hit him a little bit, not that it was easy and not that
it's going to be now,'' Jones said. ``We can draw a little bit of
confidence from that. But that was June. This is October.''
</P>
<P>
   October 1999, not 1996.

ADVERTISING: SELLING TO CHILDREN, OR MANIPULATING THEM? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deploring what they see as an unfair and conflict-ridden
manipulation of the young, a group of psychologists and other
professionals has called on the American Psychological Association
to restrict the use of psychological research by advertisers
pitching toys, videogames, snack food and other products to
children.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, written by Gary Ruskin, who heads Commercial Alert,
a Washington-based advocacy group, and Allen Kanner, a clinical
psychologist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, Calif., was sent
to the association's president late last month. It urges the
association to issue a formal denunciation of the use of
psychological techniques in marketing and advertising to children,
and asks for amendments to the association's code of ethics that
would address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which was signed by 60 psychologists and other
professionals with affiliations ranging from Sonoma State
University to Harvard Medical School, also calls for ``an ongoing
campaign to probe, review and confront the use of psychological
research in advertising and marketing to children,'' which would
include promoting strategies to shield children from ``commercial
manipulation and exploitation'' by psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, a large gap has arisen between APA's mission and
the drift of the profession into helping corporations influence
children for the purpose of selling products to them,'' the letter
stated.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the association said the matter had been
referred to its internal board on children, youth and family
issues, and that the board was scheduled to meet in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there's no mention of the issue in our code of
conduct,'' said the spokeswoman, Rhea Farberman, adding that the
points raised in the letter had not been brought before the
association before.
</P>
<P>
   Kanner said he wrote the letter after becoming concerned,
through his own conversations with children and teen-age patients,
that they were, as a group, blatantly materialistic. ``I'll ask
kids what they want to do when they grow up, and lots of times
they'll tell me, `Make money,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for psychologists' role in that, he said research conducted
at the university level was frequently deployed in developing
commercials and other pitches to children. Since the stated mission
of the American Psychological Association is ``to improve the
condition of both the individual and society,'' he concluded that
permitting research to be used in advertising to children presented
a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking this very sophisticated understanding of
children's relationships and what they respond to, and then really
tailoring it to the advertisement and refining it,'' he said.
``There's no indication that it's helping kids with their
relationships at all, but rather that it's manipulating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Kasser, an associate professor of psychology at Knox
College in Galesburg, Ill., who signed the letter, said he did so
because he saw ``a great deal of collusion between some members of
psychology and marketing, advertising and entrepreneurial firms
that are working together to try to understand how best to sell
things to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasser said his research with a colleague, Richard Ryan of the
University of Rochester, had concluded that people who value goals
like money, fame and beauty are not only more depressed than
others, but also report more behavioral problems and physical
discomfort, as well as scoring lower on measures of vitality and
self-actualization.
</P>
<P>
   For children, the consequences can be similarly damaging, Kasser
said. ``When advertisers are using psychological principles to sell
products to children, they are not only selling that product, but
they are also selling a larger value system that says making money
and using your money for the purchase of material things will make
you happy,'' he said. ``That's what is really behind almost every
commercial message, that this product will make you feel happy, or
loved, or safe and secure. My feeling is that it is manipulation to
use children's needs to get them to buy these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every psychologist feels the same way. ``The whole point is,
if you're going to market to kids, do it responsibly and there are
a whole lot of opportunities to make a positive difference,'' said
Dan Acuff, who holds a doctorate in psychology and runs a company
called Youth Market Systems Consulting in Sherman Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff, who called the goals stated in the letter ``anti-free
enterprise,'' published a book titled ``What Kids Buy and Why'' in
1997 that offers insights into how to create a successful
children's product. Included are discussions of neocortical
development, in which children start to rely more on intellect,
logic and reasoning and less on fantasy for their decision- making.
That, Acuff notes, in italics, ``has critical implications for
product and program development as well as marketing and
advertising to kids in the 8-through-12 age range.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a line psychologists should draw, he added this
week. ``We turn down opportunities that would be damaging to
kids,'' he said, ``like toys with serious weapons in them _ guns,
bombs, rifles and things like that.'' Fantasy weapons, like those
carried by He-Man and Star Wars figures, were acceptable to him, he
added, but those based on ``modern technological weapons'' were
not.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farberman, the association's spokeswoman, said psychological
techniques were also being used for ``socially redeeming issues,''
like advertising campaigns to urge people not to drink and drive.
``It's important not to lose sight of that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Halpin, the chief executive of Geppetto Group, which
specializes in children's advertising, said psychologists were
important in helping her company understand children and their
capabilities. ``For example, we learned that 6- and 7-year-olds
don't understand double-entendres,'' she said. ``They are simply
trying to learn one meaning of a word at that age. So advertising
copy that uses double-entendres as a clever device would not be
appropriate, or effective. It's things like that that help us do
the best job we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kasser raised a question: ``Maybe we're helping the
economy, but is that our mission as a discipline?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For five years, the Empire State Development Corp.,
the state agency charged with fostering a climate conducive to
business, has been credited with helping to rejuvenate New York
with its efforts to create jobs, eliminate red tape and direct
ambitious projects like the redevelopment of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   But since last fall, the corporation has been buffeted by a
criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office
that has examined everything from the agency's role in
multimillion-dollar development deals to the travel logs of its
high-profile chairman, Charles Gargano.
</P>
<P>
   Month after month, the agency has been beset by subpoenas for
documents, and more than 10 current and former staff members have
been interviewed by investigators and a grand jury that is
examining the process by which state grants and contracts were
awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas have also been served on companies that received aid
from the agency, restaurants that catered state-organized functions
and institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art that held
agency receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensity of the investigation, its progress remains
unclear: Prosecutors will not discuss their inquiry, which to date
has resulted in a just a single attempted bribery charge against a
deputy commissioner, Paolo Palombo.
</P>
<P>
   To the agency's defenders, the very breadth and length of the
inquiry are evidence that the investigation is little more than a
fishing expedition initiated on the basis of vague whispers of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the constant scrutiny has become an undeniable distraction
at the agency, where staff members say they fear that even an
unproductive investigation may tarnish the agency's record.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry also threatens to take a toll on Gargano, a wealthy
former construction executive who rose to political prominence
because of his success as a Republican fund-raiser. Gargano took
office in 1995, fending off accusations that he would use the state
agency that distributes business grants to reward campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the inquiry, which has included an examination of his phone
logs, his business holdings and a trip he took to Italy last year,
threatens to delay, and could derail, his appointment to a
prominent position within the presidential campaign of George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Gargano told friends he expected to leave the
agency in early October for the Bush campaign. But the campaign has
yet to create a spot for Gargano, and he was all but invisible
during Bush's recent two-day campaign swing through New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano's allies say his appointment is still imminent, although
there is some talk of naming him to a lower-profile state party
campaign post. A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Scott McClellan,
said, ``We have not made any decision on our New York leadership,
with the exception of Governor Pataki.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's investigation began last year as a
modest inquiry into whether agency officials misspent funds from
annual state receptions to honor Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, it had evolved into a broad exploration of issues
as diverse as the pending sale of state land on Long Island to
purchasers who include Republican campaign contributors, and the
nature of state-sponsored development deals in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at everything,'' said an official who worked
on one of the deals under scrutiny and said that Gargano's role was
negligible. ``He's been around the block. He wouldn't allow himself
to get hooked into anything that'll cause him a problem. He's been
pretty tough on deals, in my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargano, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, declined to
be interviewed. Maura Gallucci, his spokeswoman, said the agency
was cooperating fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything done here at ESDC and by Charles Gargano is
completely appropriate and above reproach,'' Ms. Gallucci said.
``Is the DA's office using the investigation into Palombo as an
opportunity to randomly look into activities at ESDC and Charles
Gargano? I don't know the answer, but I hope not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the subpoenas, for example, requested records on the
state subsidies given to Nine West, a shoe manufacturer that was
persuaded to move its headquarters from Connecticut to Westchester
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Gov. George Pataki announced the deal, in which
state and local governments provided the company with incentives
worth $7 million, the company's chief executive officer at the time
donated $15,000 to the Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation's focus was much narrower last fall when
prosecutors first began to hear complaints that bills from
state-sponsored Italian heritage celebrations had gone unpaid even
though various corporations like Coca-Cola and Banco di Napoli had
stepped in to help underwrite the affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The huge receptions, intended to honor Italian-Americans and
foster business and cultural ties with Italy, were held each year
at the Boathouse in Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum and other
stylish reception sites that could accommodate 1,500 business
leaders and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano at times made the initial contact to arrange for the
affairs, according to people who helped arrange the events. He left
the details like raising the money or booking the caterers to
Palombo, an old friend whom he had appointed the agency's deputy
commissioner for international business.
</P>
<P>
   Palombo and Gargano had known each other for two decades, their
lives entwined by a mutual interest in all things Italian. Palombo
was a talkative former baker and professor of Italian literature at
Fordham University who liked to be referred to as Il Professore.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano, who hired Palombo in 1995, relied on him not only to
lure foreign investment to New York, but also to write his speeches
in Italian, associates of the two men said.
</P>
<P>
   When vendors from the Italian heritage events began complaining
about unpaid bills, prosecutors began exploring how Palombo had
spent some of the money he had raised, according to people who have
been interviewed by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Roma View Catering of Queens, which had catered an
event aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid in 1997, threatened to
sue the state because its $9,000 bill had gone unpaid for nine
months. The agency arranged to pay the bill as year after the
events.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also questioned whether Palombo had siphoned money
from a 1988 trade show for Italian artisans that had been held at
Cipriani Wall Street, a Manhattan catering site, according to those
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Palombo had helped to arrange the event. Gargano had promoted it
as one of the fruits of the state's expanded business relationship
with Italy. A friend of Palombo's had been hired as the general
contractor who oversaw the budget for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, last June, after being questioned about these
events, Palombo agreed to plead guilty to a bribery charge. The
complaint said that he had agreed to accept $30,000 from the
manager for an Italian sculptor who had sought Palombo's help in
getting one of the artist's statues, a bronze depiction of Ulysses,
placed on state property at Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Palombo say he used the money not for his own
purposes, but to pay expenses from one of the Italian heritage
receptions. Nonetheless, he was forced to resign from his $91,877 a
year state job in July.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued, Palombo told prosecutors he had
used $6,000 of the money taken from the trade show to buy
first-class plane tickets to Italy for Gargano and the former Miss
America Phyllis George, according to people familiar with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have a copy of a $6,000 check, drawn on a Palombo
family bakery account, that Palombo said he used to pay for the
trip last summer, the people familiar with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gargano nor Ms. George would discuss the trip or how it
was financed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that accepting such tickets violates the state
law that governs the conduct of public officials. The law prohibits
officials from accepting gifts of more than $75 if it can be
inferred that the gift was given to influence the official in the
performance of his duties.
</P>
<P>
   There is no provision that bars a supervisor from accepting a
gift from a subordinate, unless the gift could be shown to have
been given as an inducement of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   However, the law requiring officials to report all gifts of more
than $1,000 is quite clear. Gargano did not list any tickets or
gifts from Palombo on his state financial disclosure form for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano's allies contend that Palombo is trying to divert
attention from himself. ``It is unfortunate, but not unusual, that
someone in his position would try to save himself by attempting to
point a finger at others,'' Ms. Gallucci said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, the investigation has roamed far from
areas where Palombo had a role. The Nine West package, for example,
was arranged by another division of the agency in 1996 to spur job
growth in Westchester County and to stabilize the commercial real
estate market in White Plains, where a third of the buildings were
vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Nine West from Stamford to White Plains brought
1,200 jobs to the state and provided a new tenant for one of
Westchester's largest office complexes. But prosecutors have
subpoenaed the records of the deal from both the state and the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did receive a subpoena, and we responded to it,'' said Jeff
Howald, the company's chief financial officer. He declined to
discuss the deal further.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the deal was announced, the company's chief
executive officer at the time, Vincent Camuto, said Gargano's
personal intercession had helped persuade the company to make the
move. Camuto, who gave $15,000 to the state Republican Party 13
days before the deal was announced, did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney has subpoenaed records on other deals as
well, including the pending $50.3 million sale of three parcels of
surplus state land on Long Island. The prospective purchaser of one
of the parcels is Arlen Contracting, whose principal, Alvin
Benjamin, is a veteran Republican contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have also sought records on the construction of
Gargano's new million-dollar home in Bridgehampton, his son's
construction company, which built the home, the redevelopment deal
for downtown New Rochelle, and a casino company, Alpha Hospitality,
in which Gargano once owned stock and served as a director.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing barrage of subpoenas has left some executives at
the state agency exhausted and bewildered. Last April, when yet one
more request for records arrived at the agency, an executive
circulated an internal memo to top staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need your collective assistance,'' the memo said, ``in
responding to a grand jury subpoena (yes, another subpoena) that
ESDC has received from the Manhattan district attorney.''

MANNESMANN SHARES FALL AFTER $33 BILLION CELLULAR PHONE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mannesmann AG, Germany's aggressive and acquisitive
engineering and telecommunications giant, intensified the
competition to dominate European mobile phone markets Thursday,
offering nearly $33 billion in stock and cash for Orange PLC,
Britain's No. 3 cellular operator.
</P>
<P>
   But investors frowned on the price, sending Mannesmann's stock
down in Frankfurt 9.5 percent, to 143.50 euros, or $155.27, even as
Klaus Esser, the chief executive, argued at a news conference here
against comparing the price for Orange with the $11.1 billion paid
by the rival Deutsche Telekom for One 2 One, the No. 4 British
wireless operator, two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should never compare apples and oranges,'' he said,
maintaining that Orange would grow at a much faster pace than One 2
One next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mannesmann bid was supported by Orange's principal
shareholder, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., which controls 44.8 percent of Orange stock. The deal will
make Hutchison Whampoa the biggest single shareholder in
Mannesmann, with 10 percent of the stock and a board seat.
Hutchison agreed not to sell roughly 80 percent of its new
Mannesmann stock for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann said it was offering 0.0965 share and 6.40 pounds
($10.73) in cash and notes for each Orange share. The bid valued
Orange at 16.29 pounds ($27.31) a share at Wednesday's close _ a 22
percent premium to Orange's closing price on Monday before
Mannesmann confirmed it was negotiating a deal. In addition, it
will assume $3.34 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in Mannesmann's stock brought the bid price below 15.30
pounds a share. Mannesmann said it would finance the cash part of
the deal with interim bank loans totaling 12 billion euros, raising
further concerns about its high debt levels.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Orange, which has yet to make a profit since it was
created five years ago, rose 4.7 percent Thursday, to 14.47 pounds
($24.26) _ still below the offering price. Analysts said Mannesmann
is relying on Orange's growth prospects in a rapidly expanding
European market where it could become the leader with 20 million
customers _ including 3.5 million from Orange.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Orange would give Mannesmann a strong
presence in the three biggest European markets. That could be a
problem for Vodafone Airtouch of Britain, the world's biggest
mobile operator, which has 31 million customers worldwide, about 13
million of them in Europe, but also a sizable minority share in
Mannesmann's D2 network along with partnership deals in Italy and
France.

EDITORIAL: THE SCHOOLS AND THE CONSTITUTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Oct. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that New York City's schools are in desperate
straits, with hordes of students failing to graduate, too many
uncredentialed teachers, and facilities that are crowded and
decaying. But a state court in Manhattan will now have to determine
whether the schools are in such abysmal shape that they violate the
state Constitution's mandate that all children be provided an
education.
</P>
<P>
   The case should give the courts an opportunity, if they have the
courage to seize it, to define more realistically than ever before
just what the state must guarantee as a minimum in the way of
education. It will also provide another lens through which the
public can analyze what needs to be done to improve the schools,
whether required by vague words in the Constitution or not.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a
coalition of advocacy groups that lost the opening rounds four
years ago in a case that was based primarily on equity issues _ on
contentions that the city was not getting its fair share of state
education funds under a formula that was said to violate the equal
protection clauses of the state and federal Constitutions and the
federal Civil Rights Act. The state court of appeals, New York's
highest court, rejected most of those arguments but left room for
the current case, which includes an equity argument but focuses
primarily on whether the state has failed to provide enough
resources to ensure a ``minimally adequate'' education.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have cited an array of evidence to demonstrate
that the city's schools are failing their students. High school
classes are jammed, with more than 30 students on average. Nearly
one in every seven teachers is uncertified. School days have been
shortened because of overcrowding. Laboratories, libraries, books
and computers are all outmoded or in short supply. The plaintiffs
got a huge boost this week when the state's own top education
officials testified that the city's schools needed more money to
help disadvantaged students meet the state's new and tougher
standards, which are required for promotion and graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The state Constitution itself says nothing about the quality of
education that must be delivered, merely that the state must
provide ``a system of free common schools, wherein all the children
of this state may be educated.'' Subsequent high court decisions
have said that the state must provide a ``sound basic education''
and ``minimally adequate'' facilities and teaching that would give
students the literacy, calculating and verbal skills needed to vote
and serve on juries. The high court left it to the trial court to
put some flesh on the definition of a ``sound basic education.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office contends that whatever New
York City is currently offering students is well above the
constitutional minimum required. How could it not be, the argument
goes, when New York is spending $9,700 per pupil, well above most
areas of the country, when the city's students score well on tests
compared with other large cities, and when individual schools and
districts in the city are clearly performing well despite the
handicaps they are said to have?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the state contends, the city itself could always put
more money into the schools than it now does if it wants to raise
their quality. That is a political decision the city has chosen not
to make, so why should the state cough up even more?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Constitution is ultimately judged to require, it
seems silly to argue that city schools are delivering a sound
education when 40 percent of the students fail to earn diplomas,
when large numbers of them require remediation when they reach the
City University, and when employers routinely complain that the
system's graduates are not prepared for the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Our own hope is that the courts will find the courage to be
realistic in defining what is needed. By any common-sense
yardstick, too many students are emerging unready for college or
jobs or perhaps even jury duty. That needs to be rectified, if not
by the courts then by the political process.

BENNO C. SCHMIDT, FINANCIER, IS DEAD AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benno C. Schmidt, the right-hand man of the financier
John Hay Whitney and a pioneering venture capitalist who became an
important backer of biotechnology ventures, a New York civic leader
and the head of the federal government's war on cancer, died on
Thursday at his home in New York. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his son, Benno C. Schmidt Jr.,
the former president of Yale University who is now chairman of the
for-profit Edison Schools Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt came to national prominence in the 1970s, when he was
appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to serve as chairman of the
President's Cancer Panel. He was also a longtime chairman of the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and served as an
informal health-policy adviser to several presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a larger impact as an early venture capitalist, a
forerunner of a relatively new breed of investor who provided much
of the seed money for technology and biotechnology industries by
financing risky start-up companies with the knowledge that most
would fail but that some would be big successes.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's successful record at Whitney's firm, J.H. Whitney &AMP;
Co. of New York, including a deal in the mid-50s to stake Minute
Maid orange juice, encouraged other investors to back similar
investments. According to several accounts, Schmidt and Whitney,
who later became editor in chief and publisher of The New York
Herald Tribune, even coined the term venture capital by shortening
``adventure'' to describe their business.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Benno Charles Schmidt spoke of a privileged
childhood made possible by his mother and aunt, who imbued in him
the importance of education. But by the standards of most people,
his was a hardscrabble upbringing in Abilene, Texas. He was born
Jan. 10, 1913, and his father died when he was 12. His mother
worked as a secretary at the county welfare association to support
the family. Growing up, Schmidt attended church three or four times
a week and spent his free time building bridges and oil derricks.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas, where he also attended law school,
he was quickly marked for greatness, capturing the attention of
professors and administrators. In a recent publication by the law
school, he was described as ``one of our legendary graduates.'' It
said that his academic achievements ``have never been excelled.''
When Schmidt received his first-year grades, he called his mother
to say that he was not only first in his class but had also scored
the highest academic average in the school's history. As he read
off his numerical averages, including his lowest, in criminal law,
his mother asked her exasperated son, ``What was the matter with
criminal law?''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, Schmidt joined the Texas law school faculty,
and then spent a year teaching at Harvard Law School. Before World
War II broke out, he was recruited to the War Production Board to
help increase the nation's industrial capacity. After Pearl Harbor,
he joined the Army, where he quickly rose to colonel and won a
number of medals, including the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star.
After the war, he spent a year as general counsel to the State
Department's economics division, helping oversee economic relations
with Britain and other allies.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day he got a call from Whitney, one of the wealthiest
men in the country. Whitney wanted to stake a new firm with $10
million to finance young companies in new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt informed Whitney that he had no business experience
whatsoever. According to Walter Curley, a longtime friend of
Schmidt, Whitney replied: ``I'm not looking for somebody who has a
lot of business experience. I'm looking for someone who has had a
lot of experience with life.'' With that, Schmidt signed on,
serving as a partner for 52 years, and as managing partner from
1960 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's early investments included sums to finance the
Spencer Chemical Co., a fertilizer and agricultural chemicals
concern that returned a more than twentyfold profit, and Minute
Maid, an investment that Schmidt encouraged despite his initial
observation that the juice concentrate tasted ``tinny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That life of venture capital fitted Benno Schmidt like a
glove, because it embodied all the things he had: curiosity,
compassion, love of life, and intelligence,'' said Curley, who
worked with Schmidt at J.H. Whitney and later served as ambassador
to Ireland and France.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Schmidt became heavily involved in New York civic
affairs, as a trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art,
chairman of the Fund for the City of New York, chairman of the
Bedford-Stuyvesant Development and Services Corp., and later,
chairman of Memorial Hospital and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin A. Thomas, the former chief executive of the Ford
Foundation, said Schmidt was the ``animating spirit'' of the
Bedford-Stuyvesant effort, which sought to improve the Brooklyn
community.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cancer panel, Schmidt also served in the
mid-1970s as a member of the President's Biomedical Research Panel,
and later, at J.H. Whitney, he pushed the firm to invest in new
biotechnology ventures. As an acknowledged leader in both the
private and public sector efforts, he had such a huge influence on
the course of medical research and investment that the writer Barry
Werth described him in 1994 as ``the senior gatekeeper of
biomedical innovation in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's survivors include four sons, Benno Jr., Ralph and
John, all of New York, and William, of Sarasota, Fla.; three
stepchildren, Ruth Fleischmann and Stephen Fleischmann, both of New
York, and James, of Philadelphia; 15 grandchildren; and one
great-grandchild. A fifth son, Thomas, died in 1966. His second
wife, Nancy Montgomery Fleischmann, died earlier this year. His
first wife, Martha Chastain, also died this year; their marriage
ended in 1962.  &QL;

ROSS PARMENTER, MUSIC CRITIC AND AUTHOR OF BOOKS ON MEXICO, DIES AT
88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ross Parmenter, a former music news editor of The New
York Times and the author of several books on Mexico, died on
Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the music staff of The Times from 1940 until his
retirement in 1964, Parmenter wrote news, features, criticism and a
column called ``The World of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   He had wide-ranging musical tastes; on one day he scolded the
concert world for not planning a Handel bicentennial celebration,
and on another he championed Marc Blitzstein's ``Regina'' as ``one
of the best operas written by an American.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Parmenter displayed both his musical knowledge and
journalistic skill when he reported on one of the most dreaded
occurrences in the world of music performance.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a Carnegie Hall performance of the Brahms Violin
Concerto by the New York Philharmonic Symphony that the A string
snapped on the violin of the soloist, Erica Morini. ``Miss Morini
swapped instruments so quickly with John Corigliano, the first
violinist, that the movement swept on almost as if nothing had
happened,'' he wrote. ``In the meantime Corigliano and another
member of the orchestra replaced the broken string, doing it so
quickly that Miss Morini's instrument was ready for her just before
the cadenza. In another quick switch with Corigliano, she got her
violin back and played the long solo passage and the rest of the
concerto on her own fiddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmenter also wrote 12 books, several of them dealing with
Mexico, where he frequently traveled. They included ``Lawrence in
Oaxaca'' (Peregrine Smith/Gibbs M. Smith, 1985).
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ross Parmenter was born on May 30, 1912, in Toronto. He
graduated from Trinity College at the University of Toronto in 1933
and joined The Times the next year, covering shipping news.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, capitalizing on his piano and voice studies, Parmenter
joined the music department. In 1955 he was named music news
editor.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors.

U.S. MOVES TO SHUT DOWN THE `CHUTZPAH TRUST' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government is moving to shut down the latest version of what
critics call the ``chutzpah trust,'' under which a legitimate
charitable-giving device is adapted to let wealthy donors escape
all taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The trust has been condemned by charity officials and estate
lawyers and by the National Committee on Planned Giving, all of
whom have called it so brazen that it invites Congress to tighten
the rules that benefit charities and their donors.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said that new regulations
were intended to end the trusts by taxing them. ``Shutting down
schemes like this helps us build a culture of compliance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal charitable remainder trust an individual donates
property, often highly appreciated stock, to a trust that will pass
it on to a charity when the donor dies. The donor avoids capital
gains taxes and gets an immediate income tax deduction for the
donated property.
</P>
<P>
   He or she also gets back an annual stream of income, typically 7
percent a year. Federal tax rules require the donor to pay taxes on
the investment earnings that are used for these payments under a
tiered system that counts first earned income, then capital gains,
tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, any other income and then
return of principal.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``chutzpah trust'' the assets are invested so as not to
produce taxable income and the trustee borrows against the trust
assets to make the payments to the donor.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan G. Blattmachr, a tax partner in the law firm of
Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy in Manhattan, said the trusts
complied with the rules that Congress created at the request of the
Treasury Department that set tiers of income for taxing the stream
of payments from charitable remainder trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wrote the rules and now you have to live with them,''
Blattmachr said. ``You can't change the rules in the middle of a
card game.''

AFTER SCANDAL, COVENANT HOUSE FOUNDER LIVED ALONE AS EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, N.Y. _ The dying priest celebrated Mass every day alone
in his chapel overlooking nothing but wooded hills and the clover
field where he knew he would be buried. He worked in his garden, he
wrote, and he visited with friends who had remained in touch
despite his scandal-stained public life, 200 miles and one decade
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bruce Ritter, 72, died of cancer on Oct. 7, in near
seclusion in this Otsego County town, population 356. In 1969, the
Roman Catholic priest founded Covenant House, a shelter for
homeless teen-agers that grew from two flats on the Lower East Side
of Manhattan to a $90 million corporation with sites in 15 cities,
the largest shelter network for homeless children in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter resigned from the agency in 1990 amid allegations that he
had sexual relationships with young men at the shelter and concerns
about a secret trust fund, although after four investigations, he
was never charged with a crime. In 1991, a lawsuit filed by one of
his accusers was thrown out because the statute of limitations had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believed the allegations against him, the acts
Ritter was accused of constituted a great betrayal: a crime against
the most vulnerable children, an abuse of the power of the
priesthood, an assault on a thriving charity and a slap in the face
to the idealistic people he attracted into social work. For those
who believe him to be innocent, he was exiled unjustly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his guilt or innocence, his friends say he rediscovered
his priesthood in his final years, living alone in a beneficent
landscape, putting up bluebirds' houses behind his farmhouse
overlooking the wooded hills 60 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived very quietly up here,'' said Joseph J. Saccente, a
former chief of staff at the Board of Education who retired to
nearby Richmondville. Saccente knew Ritter because they were the
only two to buy a New York City newspaper at Killenberger General
Store, about four miles from the priest's white house on Penksa
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Ritter died, Saccente took him vegetable soup
that his wife, Dorothy, had made from locally grown tomatoes,
zucchini and carrots. They had shared meals in each other's homes,
though the priest told the couple that he had not visited with
anyone else in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved his house,'' Saccente said. ``He loved the serenity,
and he appeared to be at peace with himself. It appears he was able
to live without people.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors knew the priest as John, the name he was given at
birth, before taking the name Bruce when he joined the Franciscans.
Those who were acquainted with him at his rural retreat saw him as
intelligent and empathic, a neighbor who walked a German shepherd
and waved from his car. They were aware of his past, because
stories had run in the local papers. But they did not shun him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he did the things he's accused of,'' said Dori Perrucci,
who before the scandal served as an editor to Ritter, working on a
book of his legendary fund-raising letters. ``Thousands of kids are
alive because of him. Many people's lives changed and went into a
whole new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   She wondered aloud if he was a saint or a sinner, then took
comfort from something a friend of hers had suggested: ``Maybe he
was both, like most of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Covenant House, from its modest conception, served a population
that had previously fallen between the cracks: homeless teen-agers
who either had run away from home or been kicked out. Many turned
to drugs and prostitution and met grisly fates.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching in the theology department of Manhattan College
in the Bronx, Ritter moved to the Lower East Side in 1968 to help
homeless young people when six of them knocked on his door during a
winter storm. At its height, Covenant House had grown to include a
large shelter on West 41st Street, an outreach van with social
workers who encouraged children to come in from the streets, and
rooms for young people with AIDS, early in the epidemic. It spent
three times more money on runaways than the federal government did.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Ritter was the force behind it _ a charismatic,
eloquent, persuasive, ambitious man who won the backing of the
city's most powerful politicians and deep-pocketed corporations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Ritter just came forward and with courage and enormous
energy and tremendous commitment reached out to these kids, raised
the money, and built an effective program where there hadn't really
been one before,'' said Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General
at the time. ``Father Ritter was a genuine hero who had personal
frailties which tragically took something away from his
achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1989, a former Covenant House resident accused him
of offering special financial benefits in return for sex. The
priest had also created a trust fund of nearly $1 million, built
mainly from his salary, which gave loans to several board members
and the priest's sister. In February 1990, he resigned, saying it
was in the best interests of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, did not
charge him with any crime. Abrams brought no charges against
Covenant House over its handling of charitable contributions. But
an investigation commissioned by Covenant House found extensive
evidence that he engaged in sexual activities with residents of the
shelter. Even if he did not, the report concluded, he ``exercised
unacceptably poor judgment in his relations with certain
residents.'' If he had not resigned, it concluded, he would have
been required to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Though contributions plummeted after the scandal, Covenant
House, which declined to comment on Ritter's death, continues to
help homeless teen-agers in the United States, Canada and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Franciscans neither cleared nor condemned him,
but the order demanded that he live in a friary and seek
counseling. Ritter, who repeatedly denied the accusations against
him, believed that seeking counseling would amount to an admission
of guilt, said the priest's former assistant at Covenant House,
John Spanier. He left the order in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   So that he could continue working as a priest, Ritter aligned
himself with a bishop in Alleppey, India. He had hoped to assist
charities there, said Alan Ouimet, who had worked with Ritter in
the Lower East Side and kept in close contact. But the priest
dropped his plans to go to India after they became public.
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, Ritter moved into the farmhouse and began
renovating it, after living in various places including Pound
Ridge, N.Y. He supported himself with help from friends and with
Mass stipends, money sent to a priest for saying Mass,
acquaintances said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter would visit St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Mass., each
month and often went on a retreat for Holy Week, as he had done
when he lived in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very, very peaceful, beautiful spiritual life,''
Ouimet said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's ashes were buried at a corner of the stone walls behind
his house, under a statue of St. Francis. About 45 friends, from as
far away as Kentucky, attended the funeral and shared remembrances
at the service, which included a reading from Ezekiel about God's
covenant with his people, and a procession around the house and up
to the grave site.
</P>
<P>
   Spanier said two men were among those who spoke about Ritter at
the funeral, one an attorney from Kentucky who had been helped
through Covenant House when he was a teen-ager. The other was a
Marine who lived near the farmhouse and who said the priest had
played an important role in his life, helping him make choices
about school and joining the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bookends to the type of people Father was able to
help and connect with,'' Spanier said.

A KEY SENATOR AGAIN BLOCKS THE BANKING BILL

 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, as legislation to overhaul the
nation's financial system looked as though it had a good chance of
passing Congress, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the Senate
Banking Committee, stood in its path and brought the bill to a
standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events are reminiscent of those that took place last
year when Gramm single-handedly sent the bill to a quiet death
through clever parliamentary maneuvering just as it was poised to
gain Senate approval and be enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   And with events of October 1999 repeating those of October 1998,
the issue that caused Gramm to mount his opposition each times was
the same _ his strident opposition to anything seen as remotely
expanding the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, a law
providing for greater bank lending to inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In taking this stand, Gramm put himself on a collision course
with the White House and Congressional Democrats, who feel that
protections are needed to eliminate discrimination in bank lending.
And his opposition has caused consternation among many bank
lobbyists, who would have rather seen the overall measure passed
than to have it hung up over a form of lending they have learned to
live with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramm has been the driving force in this process,'' said
Kenneth Guenther, lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association.
``And the Community Reinvestment Act issue has been almost a
quasi-religious issue for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Gramm has such make-it or break-it clout power over such a
historic piece of legislation can be explained simply: In a
Congress and a city of tough negotiators, he's tougher, more
tenacious and, some say, meaner than most. He is willing to hold up
an important piece of legislation _ one that he says he supports in
principle _ because it does not conform to his conservative world
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Gramm is a very, very tough negotiator,'' said Ed
Yingling, a lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. ``He
tries to maintain as much of his position as long as he can and
makes sure he gets maximum leverage at every stage of the process.
It's a negotiating tactic that gets mixed reviews, depending on
which end you are on. He does not give way easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more blunt about Gramm's well-demonstrated ability to
draw a line in the sand and never retreat: ``Frankly, people are
afraid of him,'' said another banking lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting this battle, Gramm is not representing any
constituency but himself. Banks, securities firms and insurance
companies have long ago ironed out their differences and say it is
necessary to back a measure that would allow them to enter each
other's businesses and, they say, become more globally competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And, in principle, Gramm says he supports this notion _ he just
doesn't like the measure's provisions as it relates to the
inner-city lending. For over a year, Gramm has said that he wanted
to see a bill passed that would replace the historic Glass-Steagall
Act with what would have been called the Gramm-Leach Act, after him
and the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Gramm is given high marks for his dedication to
promoting the broad concepts of the bill, for his dogged tenacity
in negotiating its finer points and for his keen understanding of
the most arcane matters of finance. Where many other legislators
leave much of the detail work to their staffs, Gramm is a hands-on,
detail-oriented committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't pass anything off to his staff,'' said Yingling, the
banking lobbyist. ``He just worked the bill really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's opposition to mandated inner-city bank lending is both
philosophical and personal. He sees government as being too
intrusive in people's lives, and the Community Reinvestment Act as
an example of that. And he dislikes the tactics of many community
activists _ one activist group this year held a demonstration on
the lawn of his suburban Washington house, trampling on his flower
beds and ripping up his tulips. In public hearings, he has called
these groups ``extortionists'' and likened the reinvestment act to
``slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, of course, does not see this year's events as an end to
financial services overhaul legislation _ just a beginning. A
strong supporter of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Gramm said on
Thursday he thought that a measure might pass next year. ``We'll
have a new president in 15 months,'' he said, ``and I know who that
new president is.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think we could have a great bill with a new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But in the next Congress many Democratic liberals such
as Maxine Waters of California and Barney Frank of Massachusetts
could rise to greater positions of power on the House Banking
Committee, making it tougher for him to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no one is counting Gramm out. Leach, who has tangled
with Gramm in many closed-door sessions, has a delicately worded
description of him. ``A major element of Phil Gramm is that he has
philosophical convictions combined with extreme tenacity,'' Leach
said in an interview. ``And those traits have done him well.''

PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' UNION IS SET TO ENDORSE MRS. CLINTON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York's largest public employees' union stayed
neutral in Sen. Charles Schumer's defeat of Alfonse D'Amato last
year, but its president said Thursday that the group will back
Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate candidacy over that of her likely
opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we will weigh in here and there's no
question who we'll weigh in for,'' Danny Donohue, president of the
265,000-member Civil Service Employees Association, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, speaking at the group's annual convention,
attacked Republican policies she called unfriendly to working
people and praised the union for being the first New York labor
group to back President Clinton's 1992 candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remain vigilant because there are many people in
Congress and in this country who want us to do a U-turn and go back
to were we were eight years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said the public employees' union did not endorse a
candidate in the Schumer-D'Amato contest because both candidates
had been responsive to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue did not say which of Giuliani's policies troubled the
group, but he said Mrs. Clinton had been a strong advocate for
education and other issues the union sees as important.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said he would formally issue the endorsement of Mrs.
Clinton after hearing from the union's political action committees
and after Mrs. Clinton officially enters the race. Because the
union has both Democratic and Republican members, Donohue said he
expected some dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have their drawbacks,'' said Jeanne Kelso, a
Republican union member from Saranac, near the Canadian border.
``Hillary is not from New York and Giuliani might think New York is
all about New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The back of Mrs. Kelso's jacket was emblazoned with the words
``Clinton County,'' which, she pointed out, was the name of her
home county, not a plug for Mrs. Clinton.

JUDGE HALTS RELEASE OF IMMIGRANT, BUT ORDERS A PANEL TO HEAR THE
CASE NEXT WEEK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal appeals court judge Thursday blocked
the release of a 31-year-old Palestinian immigrant who has been
detained for 18 months on the basis of classified evidence of
alleged links to terrorists. The judge also ruled that the case be
taken up next week by a three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there were ``complex jurisdictional and due process
questions'' involved in the case, Judge Leonard Garth, in the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, stayed a lower-court order
that the immigrant, Hany Kiareldeen, be immediately released from
jail in Hudson County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge told the parties in the case to file their legal
briefs by Tuesday, and said he would recommend ``very strongly''
that the three-judge Court of Appeals panel expedite the matter
since ``there is very questionable legal authority at the moment
for holding'' Kiareldeen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge William H. Walls of U.S. District Court
ruled that Kiareldeen's detention violated basic due-process rights
in the Constitution, and ordered his release. But Garth blocked
that order after the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In granting a temporary stay of the release order, the appeals
judge said he had planted himself midway between the government's
request for an indefinite stay pending resolution of the case and
the position of Kiareldeen's lawyers and Walls that he be released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen remains in the Hudson County Correctional Center. The
secret evidence on which he has been detained, according to
unclassified and sketchy summaries of FBI, alleges that he met with
Nidal A. Ayyad, a convicted conspirator in the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing, just a week before the bombing, uttered threats
against the life of Attorney General Janet Reno and was associated
with terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, a native of Gaza who has lived in the United States
for nine years, has denied the allegations, saying they are the
angry concoctions of his vindictive ex-wife.

EDITORIAL: BOMBINGS IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome bombing of a marketplace and maternity hospital
Thursday in Grozny is the latest tragedy in what is becoming
Russia's second full-blown war with Chechnya since the end of the
Soviet era. The first war, which began five years ago, was a
disaster for both tiny Chechnya and gigantic Russia, with Chechnya
left charred and angry while the Russian military was humiliated by
its own incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The second war will not only devastate Chechnya. It will also
paint a portrait of the new Russia that looks ominously like the
old.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russians have denied that their bombs caused more
than 100 deaths and 400 injuries in Grozny on Thursday, planes
believed to be Russian were spotted overhead, and Russian troops
have been moving steadily closer to Chechnya's war-torn capital
city.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago Russia explained the assaults on Chechnya as an
effort to rout Islamic militants who were blamed for
apartment-house bombings in Moscow and elsewhere that had killed
300 people. Russian ground troops have now gone far beyond the
``security zone'' in Chechnya that generals described as necessary
to contain Islamic militants. Instead, the generals now seem
determined to win a war with the small Caucasian republic.
</P>
<P>
   One major difference is that because of the apartment bombings,
today's Chechen conflict is far more popular in Russia than the
previous one. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, flew
triumphantly over Chechnya this week, examining the effects of the
bombing campaign on the rebellious republic's territory below.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene that played particularly well back home, where
Russians are preparing for parliamentary elections in December and
a presidential vote six months later. Putin, undoubtedly in the
running to replace Boris Yeltsin, is riding this popular war, but
his support could evaporate quickly if Russian troops once again
start returning home in body bags. Even if Russians fare better on
their second try, the greater damage could be to Russia's
international reputation.

 THE LIVES OF McCAIN-FEINGOLD  
(dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott declared the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform
bill dead on Tuesday when it failed to overcome the roadblocks
thrown in its way by, among others, Lott. Mitch McConnell, the
Senate Republicans' chief fund-raiser, said the bill had made no
headway in gaining support. They were being deceptive. In fact, the
test votes this week reflected significant progress, with 55
senators _ including 10 Republicans, 3 more than were on board this
summer _ endorsing a soft-money ban in one form or another. That
base can be expanded if McCain and other supporters make good on
their promise to bring this measure up again and again, forcing the
Senate to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue were as dead as he asserted, Lott, the majority
leader, would have no need for the duplicitous, high-handed tactics
he employed to block it. This summer he promised McCain a full five
days of debate, and a full opportunity for amendments. In return,
McCain pledged not to bring the issue up again this year if it
failed to get the 60 votes needed to cut off a filibuster. But when
the time came, Lott simply reneged on his promise. He allowed
barely more than three days, asserting that introducing the bill at
dinnertime and then shutting down the Senate for the night counted
as one of the days of debate. Lott and McConnell obviously feared
that any extended debate might arouse the public's interest and add
to the pressure on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold got some criticism for stripping the bill
down to a simple ban on unlimited contributions to political
parties for use by candidates. There were complaints about omitting
the original provision that applied fund-raising curbs to
independent groups that use the money for campaign ads. But the
tactic paid off. Senators Sam Brownback of Kansas, William Roth of
Delaware and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas voted to kill the
filibuster against the simpler bill, panicking Lott and McConnell,
who then bludgeoned two longtime supporters of the soft-money ban _
Arlen Specter and John Chafee _ into opposing the debate cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is looking more and more like Newt Gingrich, who broke his
promises to let campaign finance reform be considered in the House
last year. House Republicans took the matter into their own hands,
forcing him to bring it to the floor. The wavering in Lott's caucus
could be seen Wednesday morning, when the majority leader tried to
change the subject of campaign reform to abortion and six
Republicans broke ranks and voted against the move. It is highly
unusual for senators to challenge their leader on a procedural
issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made it clear that he now feels no obligation to
honor his promise not to bring up campaign reform again this year.
He and others have made the analogy to the civil rights struggles
of the 1960s, when it took innumerable cloture votes and threats of
filibusters to bring the issue to the attention of voters. With the
spread of more and more ``soft money'' _ the unlimited donations
from corporations, unions and rich donors _ the public's impatience
for reform will grow. Each new attempt at debate and amendment
could draw in senators like Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, whose
proposals to amend the bill, though flawed, suggest that he and
others might be prepared to back the bill in some form.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is clear that the Republican fund-raising machine is
thwarting the will of 55 senators, the voices of Americans need to
be heard. McCain was right when he told his colleagues that sooner
or later reform would happen. It can happen sooner if supporters do
not give up now. &QL;

MAKING DRASTIC CHANGES IS LESS LIKELY FOR RANGERS

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers owner Tom Hicks has given general
manager Doug Melvin the flexibility to build next year's team
without cutting the $75 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in Melvin's approach to doing that is addressing
the club's nine potential free agents. Only then will he get an
idea how much it will cost to put together the team and if they
need to trade outfielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is talk to our own free agents and see if
they want to stay here,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said it is premature to talk about trading Gonzalez,
Rusty Greer or any other player until the Rangers see where what
appears to be a weak free-agent market is headed.
</P>
<P>
   With the flexibility given to him by Hicks, Melvin said: ``I
don't think our team will be drastically different. Our ownership
has given us the flexibility if the right thing comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and Hicks met earlier this week to outline the club's
course of action during the off-season. The Rangers have targeted a
payroll of less than $75 million, but Melvin and Hicks emphasized
that could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get better,'' Hicks said. ``Doug has some very
good ideas. In fact, we went through three hours of his ideas. It's
a process that will be on-going.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has one year left on his contract at $7.5 million and
could be a free agent after next season. A National League
executive said last week, ``If the Rangers want to trade Gonzalez,
there will be teams interested.''
</P>
<P>
   But his future with the Rangers also could be determined by what
happens in Seattle. Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. and
shortstop Alex Rodriguez are also eligible for free agency after
the 2000 season and major-league officials estimate they could
command between $15 million and $20 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to analyze where the industry is going and what
happens with Griffey and Rodriguez,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are trying to re-sign both, but Rodriguez's agent,
Scott Boras, has said they won't sign a long-term deal this
off-season. Boras said that includes the Mariners or another team
if Rodriguez is traded.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bronner, Gonzalez's agent, is making no such public
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we decide to do, we're going to keep it between us
and the Rangers,'' Bronner said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   This is considered a weak free-agent market. The best players
available appear to be Cincinnati outfielder Greg Vaughn, New York
Yankees pitcher David Cone and New York Mets first baseman John
Olerud. The market looks much stronger after next season, with
Griffey, Rodriguez, Gonzalez, Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina,
Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin, Cleveland outfielder Manny
Ramirez, Houston second baseman Craig Biggio, Toronto outfielder
Shawn Green and Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has indicated his priority is still pitching. The Rangers
have interest in re-signing right-hander Aaron Sele, but Melvin
also wants to add at least one left-handed starter. The top
free-agent left-handed pitchers appear to be Kenny Rogers, Chuck
Finley and Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   But priorities have a way of changing in the off-season. The
Rangers started last off-season trying to sign pitcher Randy
Johnson and trade for Roger Clemens, then ended up signing first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time last year, I had no idea we would sign Raffy,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's plan right now is to look at his own free agents, and
second baseman Mark McLemore could move to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect to reduce payroll by going with rookies Ruben
Mateo in center field and Mike Lamb at third base instead of Tom
Goodwin and Todd Zeile, moves that would cut approximately $6
million from the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers aren't ready to commit to rookie Kelly
Dransfeldt at second base; he hit .237 this season at Triple-A
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to Mark,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore is 35, but is coming off one of his best seasons. He
hit .274 with 83 walks and 105 runs scored and was fifth among
American League second baseman in fielding. He has had knee
troubles the past three seasons, but this year he played in 144 of
162 games.
</P>
<P>
   There are several options among free agents but no clear-cut
answers. The candidates include Mickey Morandini of the Cubs and
Braves utility man Jose Hernandez. Houston's Ricky Gutierrez and
Kansas City's Rey Sanchez both played shortstop this year but could
be converted to second base.

TRAINER UNDERSTANDS JOCKEY'S TOUGH CHOICE

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ James Lackey knows what Jacky Martin is
going through. Martin rode two horses trained by Lackey and
qualified them for the finals of the $212,350 Dash For Cash Derby
scheduled tonight at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Okey Dokey Dale was the fastest qualifier in the trials two
weeks ago, but Martin chose fourth-fastest Heza Bold Man. Lackey, a
former jockey, knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Heza Bold Man ``slipped getting away from the gates and pulled a
shoe halfway off and had to run like that all the way down there,''
Lackey said. ``Both horses are doing really well, and I know it was
a tough decision for Jacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Lackey can look at Okey Dokey Dale and remember a time when he
didn't have to make a decision like that. Not only does Lackey
train Okey Dokey Dale, but when he was a jockey, he rode the two
horses that eventually produced Okey Dokey Dale. He rode Okey Dokey
Dale's sire _ First Down Dash _ to win the Champion of Champions in
1987. And the dam _ Okey Dokey Baby _ won the 1988 Kansas Futurity
with Lackey aboard.
</P>
<P>
   First Down Dash and Okey Dokey Baby never met on the track. But
if they had, Lackey would have picked First Down Dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that Okey Dokey Baby wasn't a great horse,'' Lackey said.
``But First Down Dash won seven of eight races as a 3-year-old and
not only beat older horses, he won by a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Down Dash, when he went out to the racetrack, there was
no going slow at all. Okey Dokey Dale has the same hair color of
his momma, but I see more of his daddy in him physically and
mentally. When Okey Dokey Dale gets out on the track, he gets hot
and wants to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another local tie to Okey Dokey Dale. Jeff Hooper,
director of administration at Lone Star, was in the ownership group
that campaigned Okey Dokey Baby when she won the Kansas.

PRIME TIME MIGHT BE OVER FOR FILLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Silverbulletday might be bumping into a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Look out everyone. Bob Baffert is thinking out loud again.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is wondering _ yes, out loud _ what he should do with
one of the fillies in his barn. But it's a lot simpler this time.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not, as it was earlier this year, if he should
place the filly against the boys. Chilukki's a 2-year-old, so that
decision might not bother anyone until next year.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Baffert is wondering if he should even run
the filly Silverbulletday. We're 15 days away from the Breeders'
Cup, and Baffert doesn't know if Silverbulletday will even run at
all.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when horses such as Puerto Madero, Free House,
Charismatic, Silver Charm, Victory Gallop, Mazel Trick and Real
Quiet have flashed ever so briefly before coming up injured,
Silverbulletday has been this year's fantastic racehorse from start
to just-about-finish.
</P>
<P>
   No, she's not Horse of the Year. But she has been the most fun
to watch throughout the season, turning on that trademark
acceleration and stepping easily away from her generation and
gender with the mark of the divisional champion that she is.
</P>
<P>
   But her loss in the Beldame Stakes last week at Belmont Park has
put the brakes on in the mind of Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's peaked,'' Baffert said, ``and she might be
tailing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the first reaction is to think that Baffert is playing the
poor boy. Maybe he's like a political candidate, taking the edge
off the expectations just in case the votes come up short.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something to Baffert's concern. No matter how
spectacular the racehorse _ and Silverbulletday has been every bit
of that _ there comes a time when they hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If a horse gets good, the demand for its appearances by
racetracks across the country surges. It will travel and run a lot
_ maybe more than the average stakes horse _ and then the wall
looms. Go ask the two most spectacular horses of the decade, Cigar
and Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Cigar had his 16-race winning streak snapped, it
looked as if he would win another Breeders' Cup Classic that year.
He got caught in a speed trap that day at Del Mar, but that didn't
keep him from winning the Woodward the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Then he lost to Skip Away in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, when it
seemed as if Cigar was struggling to cut into the margin. That day,
he ran second. He finished third in the Breeders' Cup, and then he
was retired.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cigar, Skip Away traveled coast-to-coast winning the Donn
Handicap and Hollywood Gold Cup. But he had trouble in the
Massachusetts Handicap, winning by a close margin. He lost in the
Gold Cup to upsetter Allen Jerkins' Wagon Limit. And he didn't even
hit the board at the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, it wasn't a one-race funk before the Breeders'
Cup. A series of races showed that the superstar was getting
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And so, too, it could be happening to Silverbulletday. Her race
in the Gazelle Stakes that led up to the Beldame was flat. After
winning the Alabama at Saratoga by nine lengths, she struggled to
win the Gazelle by a couple lengths under late pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was no way Silverbulletday was going to catch
Beautiful Pleasure and that easy lead of hers on a sloppy track in
the Beldame. Maybe that was it. Or maybe she's hitting the wall
right about now. Maybe we'll find out on Breeders' Cup day. SEND TO
LOS AL
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 11 days of Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's
quarter horse season, it's clear that getting the simulcast signal
out to Los Alamitos Racecourse in California is a good idea.
Because state law in California restricts out-of-state simulcasts
to times when Los Alamitos is conducting its own live meet, Lone
Star can only send the simulcasts at night.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit is easy to see. On Thursday and Friday nights when
Los Alamitos is part of the network, Lone Star handles $737,000 off
track. On Saturday and Sunday when Los Alamitos is absent, Lone
Star handles $271,000 off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agonized over this decision before the meet started,'' Lone
Star general manager Corey Johnsen said. ``We get more revenue from
live betting on track, and we get a lot more crossover betting on
our live product from people watching the thoroughbred simulcasts
here at Lone Star during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Live betting on track, so far, is down from last year (from
$269,000 to $257,000). Johnsen said the current racing schedule
will remained unchanged this year. But it might change in favor of
more night racing in time for next year's quarter horse season.
Delightful dashes A Delightful Dasher, winner of the All American
Futurity last month, is scheduled to make his next start in the
trials of the $425,000 Golden State Futurity tonight at Los
Alamitos. The final is Nov. 5. CHECK OUT THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   Artax caught many an eye when he cut through 6 furlongs in 1
minute, 7 3-5 seconds to win the Forest Hills Handicap last week at
Belmont Park. The time broke the track record set a decade ago by
Texas-bred Groovy.
</P>
<P>
   But also last week, a horse named Lexicon rattled through 6
furlongs in 1:07 4-5 to win the Ancient Title Breeders' Cup
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Artax has to be deemed superior, and that's
not just because he went a tick faster. Remember that Santa Anita
has a hardpan of a racing surface compared to Belmont's ``Big
Sandy'' strip. CHANGE IN SCENERY
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing finishes Sunday at Retama Park near San
Antonio, and the thoroughbreds start running Thursday at Sam
Houston Race Park in Houston through April 9. Here are the
highlights for Houston:
</P>
<P>
   Texas Champions Day, with purses of more than $675,000,
including the $200,000 Gallery Furniture Texan Juvenile, is set for
Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The $150,000 John Connally Breeders' Cup Turf is set for Feb.
26.

troubles the past three seasons, but this year he played in 144 of
162 games.
</P>
<P>
   There are several options among free agents but no clear-cut
answers. The candidates include Mickey Morandini of the Cubs and
Braves utility man Jose Hernandez. Houston's Ricky Gutierrez and
Kansas City's Rey Sanchez both played shortstop this year but could
be converted to second base.

TRAINER UNDERSTANDS JOCKEY'S TOUGH CHOICE

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ James Lackey knows what Jacky Martin is
going through. Martin rode two horses trained by Lackey and
qualified them for the finals of the $212,350 Dash For Cash Derby
scheduled tonight at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Okey Dokey Dale was the fastest qualifier in the trials two
weeks ago, but Martin chose fourth-fastest Heza Bold Man. Lackey, a
former jockey, knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Heza Bold Man ``slipped getting away from the gates and pulled a
shoe halfway off and had to run like that all the way down there,''
Lackey said. ``Both horses are doing really well, and I know it was
a tough decision for Jacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Lackey can look at Okey Dokey Dale and remember a time when he
didn't have to make a decision like that. Not only does Lackey
train Okey Dokey Dale, but when he was a jockey, he rode the two
horses that eventually produced Okey Dokey Dale. He rode Okey Dokey
Dale's sire _ First Down Dash _ to win the Champion of Champions in
1987. And the dam _ Okey Dokey Baby _ won the 1988 Kansas Futurity
with Lackey aboard.
</P>
<P>
   First Down Dash and Okey Dokey Baby never met on the track. But
if they had, Lackey would have picked First Down Dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that Okey Dokey Baby wasn't a great horse,'' Lackey said.
``But First Down Dash won seven of eight races as a 3-year-old and
not only beat older horses, he won by a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Down Dash, when he went out to the racetrack, there was
no going slow at all. Okey Dokey Dale has the same hair color of
his momma, but I see more of his daddy in him physically and
mentally. When Okey Dokey Dale gets out on the track, he gets hot
and wants to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another local tie to Okey Dokey Dale. Jeff Hooper,
director of administration at Lone Star, was in the ownership group
that campaigned Okey Dokey Baby when she won the Kansas.

PRIME TIME MIGHT BE OVER FOR FILLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Silverbulletday might be bumping into a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Look out everyone. Bob Baffert is thinking out loud again.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is wondering _ yes, out loud _ what he should do with
one of the fillies in his barn. But it's a lot simpler this time.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not, as it was earlier this year, if he should
place the filly against the boys. Chilukki's a 2-year-old, so that
decision might not bother anyone until next year.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Baffert is wondering if he should even run
the filly Silverbulletday. We're 15 days away from the Breeders'
Cup, and Baffert doesn't know if Silverbulletday will even run at
all.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when horses such as Puerto Madero, Free House,
Charismatic, Silver Charm, Victory Gallop, Mazel Trick and Real
Quiet have flashed ever so briefly before coming up injured,
Silverbulletday has been this year's fantastic racehorse from start
to just-about-finish.
</P>
<P>
   No, she's not Horse of the Year. But she has been the most fun
to watch throughout the season, turning on that trademark
acceleration and stepping easily away from her generation and
gender with the mark of the divisional champion that she is.
</P>
<P>
   But her loss in the Beldame Stakes last week at Belmont Park has
put the brakes on in the mind of Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's peaked,'' Baffert said, ``and she might be
tailing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the first reaction is to think that Baffert is playing the
poor boy. Maybe he's like a political candidate, taking the edge
off the expectations just in case the votes come up short.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something to Baffert's concern. No matter how
spectacular the racehorse _ and Silverbulletday has been every bit
of that _ there comes a time when they hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If a horse gets good, the demand for its appearances by
racetracks across the country surges. It will travel and run a lot
_ maybe more than the average stakes horse _ and then the wall
looms. Go ask the two most spectacular horses of the decade, Cigar
and Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Cigar had his 16-race winning streak snapped, it
looked as if he would win another Breeders' Cup Classic that year.
He got caught in a speed trap that day at Del Mar, but that didn't
keep him from winning the Woodward the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Then he lost to Skip Away in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, when it
seemed as if Cigar was struggling to cut into the margin. That day,
he ran second. He finished third in the Breeders' Cup, and then he
was retired.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cigar, Skip Away traveled coast-to-coast winning the Donn
Handicap and Hollywood Gold Cup. But he had trouble in the
Massachusetts Handicap, winning by a close margin. He lost in the
Gold Cup to upsetter Allen Jerkins' Wagon Limit. And he didn't even
hit the board at the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, it wasn't a one-race funk before the Breeders'
Cup. A series of races showed that the superstar was getting
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And so, too, it could be happening to Silverbulletday. Her race
in the Gazelle Stakes that led up to the Beldame was flat. After
winning the Alabama at Saratoga by nine lengths, she struggled to
win the Gazelle by a couple lengths under late pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was no way Silverbulletday was going to catch
Beautiful Pleasure and that easy lead of hers on a sloppy track in
the Beldame. Maybe that was it. Or maybe she's hitting the wall
right about now. Maybe we'll find out on Breeders' Cup day. SEND TO
LOS AL
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 11 days of Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's
quarter horse season, it's clear that getting the simulcast signal
out to Los Alamitos Racecourse in California is a good idea.
Because state law in California restricts out-of-state simulcasts
to times when Los Alamitos is conducting its own live meet, Lone
Star can only send the simulcasts at night.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit is easy to see. On Thursday and Friday nights when
Los Alamitos is part of the network, Lone Star handles $737,000 off
track. On Saturday and Sunday when Los Alamitos is absent, Lone
Star handles $271,000 off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agonized over this decision before the meet started,'' Lone
Star general manager Corey Johnsen said. ``We get more revenue from
live betting on track, and we get a lot more crossover betting on
our live product from people watching the thoroughbred simulcasts
here at Lone Star during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Live betting on track, so far, is down from last year (from
$269,000 to $257,000). Johnsen said the current racing schedule
will remained unchanged this year. But it might change in favor of
more night racing in time for next year's quarter horse season.
Delightful dashes A Delightful Dasher, winner of the All American
Futurity last month, is scheduled to make his next start in the
trials of the $425,000 Golden State Futurity tonight at Los
Alamitos. The final is Nov. 5. CHECK OUT THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   Artax caught many an eye when he cut through 6 furlongs in 1
minute, 7 3-5 seconds to win the Forest Hills Handicap last week at
Belmont Park. The time broke the track record set a decade ago by
Texas-bred Groovy.
</P>
<P>
   But also last week, a horse named Lexicon rattled through 6
furlongs in 1:07 4-5 to win the Ancient Title Breeders' Cup
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Artax has to be deemed superior, and that's
not just because he went a tick faster. Remember that Santa Anita
has a hardpan of a racing surface compared to Belmont's ``Big
Sandy'' strip. CHANGE IN SCENERY
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing finishes Sunday at Retama Park near San
Antonio, and the thoroughbreds start running Thursday at Sam
Houston Race Park in Houston through April 9. Here are the
highlights for Houston:
</P>
<P>
   Texas Champions Day, with purses of more than $675,000,
including the $200,000 Gallery Furniture Texan Juvenile, is set for
Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The $150,000 John Connally Breeders' Cup Turf is set for Feb.
26.

MAKING DRASTIC CHANGES IS LESS LIKELY FOR RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers owner Tom Hicks has given general
manager Doug Melvin the flexibility to build next year's team
without cutting the $75 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in Melvin's approach to doing that is addressing
the club's nine potential free agents. Only then will he get an
idea how much it will cost to put together the team and if they
need to trade outfielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is talk to our own free agents and see if
they want to stay here,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said it is premature to talk about trading Gonzalez,
Rusty Greer or any other player until the Rangers see where what
appears to be a weak free-agent market is headed.
</P>
<P>
   With the flexibility given to him by Hicks, Melvin said: ``I
don't think our team will be drastically different. Our ownership
has given us the flexibility if the right thing comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and Hicks met earlier this week to outline the club's
course of action during the off-season. The Rangers have targeted a
payroll of less than $75 million, but Melvin and Hicks emphasized
that could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get better,'' Hicks said. ``Doug has some very
good ideas. In fact, we went through three hours of his ideas. It's
a process that will be on-going.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has one year left on his contract at $7.5 million and
could be a free agent after next season. A National League
executive said last week, ``If the Rangers want to trade Gonzalez,
there will be teams interested.''
</P>
<P>
   But his future with the Rangers also could be determined by what
happens in Seattle. Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. and
shortstop Alex Rodriguez are also eligible for free agency after
the 2000 season and major-league officials estimate they could
command between $15 million and $20 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to analyze where the industry is going and what
happens with Griffey and Rodriguez,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are trying to re-sign both, but Rodriguez's agent,
Scott Boras, has said they won't sign a long-term deal this
off-season. Boras said that includes the Mariners or another team
if Rodriguez is traded.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bronner, Gonzalez's agent, is making no such public
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we decide to do, we're going to keep it between us
and the Rangers,'' Bronner said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   This is considered a weak free-agent market. The best players
available appear to be Cincinnati outfielder Greg Vaughn, New York
Yankees pitcher David Cone and New York Mets first baseman John
Olerud. The market looks much stronger after next season, with
Griffey, Rodriguez, Gonzalez, Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina,
Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin, Cleveland outfielder Manny
Ramirez, Houston second baseman Craig Biggio, Toronto outfielder
Shawn Green and Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has indicated his priority is still pitching. The Rangers
have interest in re-signing right-hander Aaron Sele, but Melvin
also wants to add at least one left-handed starter. The top
free-agent left-handed pitchers appear to be Kenny Rogers, Chuck
Finley and Darren Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   But priorities have a way of changing in the off-season. The
Rangers started last off-season trying to sign pitcher Randy
Johnson and trade for Roger Clemens, then ended up signing first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time last year, I had no idea we would sign Raffy,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's plan right now is to look at his own free agents, and
second baseman Mark McLemore could move to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect to reduce payroll by going with rookies Ruben
Mateo in center field and Mike Lamb at third base instead of Tom
Goodwin and Todd Zeile, moves that would cut approximately $6
million from the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers aren't ready to commit to rookie Kelly
Dransfeldt at second base; he hit .237 this season at Triple-A
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk to Mark,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore is 35, but is coming off one of his best seasons. He
hit .274 with 83 walks and 105 runs scored and was fifth among
American League second baseman in fielding. He has had knee
troubles the past three seasons, but this year he played in 144 of
162 games.
</P>
<P>
   There are several options among free agents but no clear-cut
answers. The candidates include Mickey Morandini of the Cubs and
Braves utility man Jose Hernandez. Houston's Ricky Gutierrez and
Kansas City's Rey Sanchez both played shortstop this year but could
be converted to second base.

BRAVES CRUEL SUB IN SUBWAY SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It could have been a historic Subway Series of
riveting drama and tabloid hysterics between the New York Yankees
and New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   It could have revived long ago memories when the Yankees so
often would spend their Octobers battling the Brooklyn Dodgers or
the New York Giants to determine the baseball champion of the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the Bronx vs. Queens, the established,
aristocratic Yankees putting their sacred reputation on the line
against the sassy, resilient Mets, the controversial New York
mayor, Rudy Guliani, inflaming the passions of many of his
constituents by openly rooting for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But those doughty Atlanta Braves, who have turned the World
Series into their private stage during the 1990s, ruined the New
York party Tuesday evening by eliminating the Mets to win the
National League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toughest loss I've ever gone through,'' says Harry Minor, the
longtime Mets scouts
</P>
<P>
   from Long Beach. ``I've gone over that game 100 times in my
mind. Tough, tough loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The bereaved Minor is picking the Braves to continue their good
fortune against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves pitching is just too good,'' he says. ``And
pitching is going to wind up winning this World Series. I know the
Yankees also have good pitching, but they're not as deep as the
Braves. There are some questions marks about the Yankees' pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Orlando) Hernandez has been solid. But the
left-hander, Andy Petitte, has been erratic, although he's pitched
well lately. Coney (David Cone) isn't what he once was. And neither
apparently is Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves still have Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz
to throw at you, as well as Kevin Millwood. I think overall the
Yankees might have a better ball club. But the Braves' pitching
just seems to shut everyone down.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have opened as minus $120 favorite in Las Vegas,
but, ironically, the Braves are minus $115 picks with Glavine
starting in Saturday night's World Series opener at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of two-way action on this series,'' reports
Jimmy Vaccaro, the well-known Las Vegas gambler. ``There really
isn't a clear-cute
</P>
<P>
   favorite.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The Braves remind me so much of the 1988 Dodgers. Every break
and fortuitous bounce seem to go their way. ...
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones fans will disagree with me, but I think the best
player on either side is Derek Jeter. ...
</P>
<P>
   Whoever thought the day would arrive when Roger Clemens would be
referred to as the weak link of a team's pitching staff? ...
</P>
<P>
   There were those like me who thought the Braves would decline
when they lost their All-Star catcher, Javier Lopez. We were wrong.
If anything, the team is even tougher with the fiery Eddie Perez.
...
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre has ascended to genius status these days with the
Yankees. It's a level he never came faintly close to reaching when
he lost managerial jobs with the Mets, Braves and St. Louis
Cardinals. Funny what miracles George Steinbrenner's formidable
bank account can do for a person's baseball IQ. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez is as exceptional as a fielder as he is
unexceptional as a hitter. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine's loyalty to Kenny Rogers that goes back to
their days with the Texas Rangers might have cost the Mets an N.L.
pennant. ...
</P>
<P>
   Those rushing to anoint Bobby Cox are suffering amnesia and seem
to have forgotten his countless playoff blunders in the past that I
think cost the Braves at least one or even two World Series titles.
...
</P>
<P>
   I get the feeling that the Yankees don't think anyone can beat
them, but the Braves' stout pitching quickly can change such an
attitude. ...
</P>
<P>
   I actually saw Bobby Cox play football and basketball, as well
as baseball, when he attended Selma High up in the San Joaquin
Valley. He was a terrific quarterback who had many scholarship
offers, but signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. ...
</P>
<P>
   If I were Jimy Williams, the Boston manager, I'd have been
kicked out long before Game 4 of the ALCS when the umpires blew two
more calls against the Red Sox. The Yankees didn't need help from
the umps to beat the Red Sox, but they certainly got it. ...
</P>
<P>
   A guy who didn't identify himself left a message on my answering
machine the other day wondering why Paul Hackett wore sun glasses
on an overcast afternoon at South Bend. Perhaps he wanted to shield
his eyes from the Trojans' latest collapse. ...
</P>
<P>
   The USC-Notre Dame match featured two men, Hackett and Bob
Davies, who I doubt ever will receive Coach of the Year
consideration. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've seen teams lapse into chaos during crisis time, but I don't
recall any more disoriented at such a juncture than Hackett's
Trojans. Now I have an inkling what happened to him at Pittsburgh.
...
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone care that Mike Tyson is fighting again this weekend?
...
</P>
<P>
   Will someone please tell my old radio pal, Chris Roberts, to
start using the proper articles during his UCLA broadcasts. He
mistakenly keeps using ``that'' instead of ``the,'' like, ``Cory
Paus scrambled to that
</P>
<P>
   20-yard line'' or the Bruins are all the way down to that
</P>
<P>
   10-yard line. Maybe that
</P>
<P>
   Chris Roberts is a rhetorical pioneer determined to alter that
</P>
<P>
   English language. ...
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic Long Beach State women's basketball coach, Dallas
Boychuk-Bolla, is celebrating her birthday today. Chivalry and not
being too lazy to look it up in the 49ers' press guide prevents me
from revealing her age even though she's not old enough yet for
such entitlement. ...
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Ortiz was given an ovation for his moving introduction of
the ailing former featherweight champion, Raul Rojas, at the World
Boxing Hall of Fame banquet last Saturday night in Los Angeles. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is no one who enjoys listening to Bob Costas talk more
than Bob Costas. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think the Raiders are the best 3-3 team in the NFL. ...
</P>
<P>
   I know a guy who bet against Miami the past two weekends, and he
suffered mightily in the wake of the Dolphins' final-second
victories over Indianapolis and New England. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now that Keri Nishimoto has become a top-flight setter, what's
the Long Beach State volleyball Houdini, Brian Gimmillaro, going to
do with the talented freshman, Brittany Hochevar, who was touted to
be Misty May's successor at the start of the season? I doubt
Hochevar will stand patiently on the sidelines for the next two
years waiting for Nishimoto to graduate. ...
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain and I became friends after a heated argument in
which, in the impulsive stupidity of my youth, I actually invited
him to punch me. Fortunately, he declined, or else I wouldn't now
be typing out these words on my computer. ...
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw Joe McDonnell and Del Harris laughingly chatting
it up at Phil Trani's golf tournament last Monday were startled by
the sight, since McDonnell spent almost all his waking hours for a
couple of years cruelly vilifying the former Laker head coach on
his radio broadcasts. ...
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is oozing at Long Beach State about the men's
basketball team, and the law of averages certainly is on Wayne
Morgan's side. I mean, one of these years Morgan is bound to have a
winning season.

FEDERAL COURT RULES CITY MUST ALLOW KLAN RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for additions; additional background information in grafs 4,
7-11; the final six grafs contain additional quotes.)  (sw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal court ruled on Thursday night that the Ku
Klux Klan must be allowed to demonstrate in lower Manhattan this
weekend, saying that the city had violated the group's First
Amendment rights by refusing to permit the rally if Klan members
wore their traditional masks.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering that the protest could proceed Saturday afternoon, a
special two-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan
also elicited a promise from a top city lawyer that the Klan
members would not be arrested for wearing masks at the
demonstration, which is against state law.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing their ruling, the judges did not go as far as the
Klan had sought, which was to declare the city's antimask law
unconstitutional in all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan has sought to overturn such laws across the country and
has been successful in some cases, including in towns in Indiana
and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, city officials said they would file an appeal
on Friday morning with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan, and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued a statement sharply critical of the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of the ideology extended from the
60s,'' Giuliani said. ``This ruling says people don't have to take
responsibility for what they say or what they do, even as they
support organizations that encourage anti-Semitism,
anti-Catholicism, racism and hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges also rejected a claim that the First Amendment rights
of a group of Klan opponents had been violated when they were
turned down by the police after seeking to stage a rally to drown
out the Klan demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan sued the city on Tuesday after its organizers were told
by the police that they could not hold their rally, which was
expected to draw between 50 and 80 Klan members, if they insisted
on wearing their masks along with their traditional robes and
pointed hoods. The group had said it chose New York City, where it
had never held a rally before, in part to challenge its antimask
law.
</P>
<P>
   Two leaders of the group, the American Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, testified at Thursday's packed hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Berry, the leader, or imperial wizard, of the group,
acknowledged in court that his rallies have often drawn violent
reactions from protesters, who throw bottles, rocks and other
objects at them.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision was issued, Mr. Berry, who appeared in court
in a dark, three-piece suit and a bright green necktie, said: ``The
Constitution was there. The judges are sworn to uphold the
Constitution. And they done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city had argued in court that the mask law was intended not
to stifle unpopular speech but to enable the Police Department to
do its job at rallies where the potential for violence existed.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the reason for the city's appeal on Friday,
Michael D. Hess, the corporation counsel of New York City, cited
the violence seen at previous Klan rallies that Berry testified
about in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are faced with this type of violence,'' Hess said, it
was important for the police ``that the identity of every
individual be known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to discourage violence, and one way to discourage
violence is to know who you're faced with,'' he said. ``The court,
we feel, erred in saying that masks can be used because that takes
away from the Police Department's ability to identify people and
hold them responsible for their actions if there is violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judges, Harold Baer Jr. and Alvin K. Hellerstein, while
sympathizing with the department's predicament, said there had been
no testimony suggesting that the Klan members were likely to engage
in violence themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Supreme Court decisions that protect certain forms of
conduct or expression under the First Amendment, the judges said
they agreed with the Klan's position that the masks afforded the
group's members anonymity and protection from potential retaliation
in their home communities or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masks have a _ perhaps tortured is a good word to use _
history in the United States,'' Hellerstein said, ``creating fear,
and fear of physical violence on the part of one group of our
citizens, and creating the message of hate and spite and everything
that America does not stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, masks also reflect ``a fear of people who express
themselves in various parts of our society, including the society
of New York, that they may be subject to harm, both physical and
economic, if they are unmasked and their identities are known.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer quoted from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, saying, ``I
think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to
check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be
fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate
interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that
an immediate check is required to save the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges' decision could be upheld Friday by the appeals
court, or overturned, which could make Klan members subject to
arrest if they held the rally in masks.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the mask law, a city lawyer, Daniel S. Connolly,
told the judges that the police would have a more difficult task
when facing a crowd of masked demonstrators who, ``emboldened by
the shield of anonymity,'' could break the law, knowing it would be
hard for them to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   But Berry, in his testimony, insisted that his group, now five
years old, differed from the Klan of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the American Knights ``a nonviolent Christian white
civil rights group,'' he rejected the idea that he belonged to ``a
hate group'' that would use violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hung anybody,'' he said. ``I have never killed
anybody. And I have never beaten up anybody because of their
religious beliefs or the color of their skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he reiterated that point, and in an assertion that drew
an audible gasp from spectators, he added: ``This is the '90s. Like
Rodney King said, `Why can't we all get along?'''

FOR MAYBE LAST TIME, IT'S THE HATFIELDS AND MCTRAITORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Let's be frank here. The idea of TCU playing
Rice for an inside track to all the conference's football marbles
is:
</P>
<P>
   A. a stunning example of NCAA parity.
</P>
<P>
   B. the plot of another wacky Dan Jenkins book.
</P>
<P>
   C. a joke that the Rice band won't be able to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's true. In this last year of the 1900s, it appears that
the planets have aligned, the Southwest Conference is spinning in
its grave, and tomorrow in Houston the TCU Horned Frogs will
actually play the Rice Owls in a game that brims with possible
postseason significance.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of game that the Frogs and Owls used to play
semiregularly when your granddaddy was at TCU. It's the kind of
showdown that prompted a once-princely edifice like Rice Stadium to
be built in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It's for an upper hand in the (wince) WAC, that
Honey-They-Shrunk-The-Conference league. It's all about private
school pride and ``why didn't you call and tell me you were
leaving?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a big game,'' TCU coach Dennis Franchione has finally
admitted. ``What I've been telling the kids is that, yes, this is a
big game, but there could be bigger ones.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3-3, the Frogs are on a relative roll, having run roughshod
at home over San Jose State and Tulsa. Rice, meanwhile, has won
four consecutive against the likes of Navy, Tulsa, Hawaii and San
Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the same, granted, as knocking off Baylor and Texas
A&AMP;M, but neither Rice nor TCU is in a position to toss any fish
back. Rice hasn't been to a bowl game in 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Athletic Conference winner will earn a trip to the
Las Vegas Bowl. Both teams have legitimate shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls, like Franchione's Frogs, move the football best when
on the ground. Also like the Frogs, Ken Hatfield's Owls have
displayed a begrudging defense. The teams rank one-two in the WAC
in both rushing and total defense.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't lie. Life clearly is easier on the eyes when
you don't have to drive to Austin, College Station or Lubbock every
other week. Though they are bound, in the fall of 2001, for even
greener pastures, the Frogs should not deny that their football
fortunes have been enriched by competing in the rebellious WAC.
</P>
<P>
   But that brings up a sore point. Rice officials reportedly are
peeved that TCU has accepted an invitation to bolt to Conference
USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houston Chronicle'' this week reported that Rice
representatives called TCU officials to ask if it was true that the
Frogs were pursuing a C-USA spot. The Rice people claimed that TCU
said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way we do business,'' Rice president Malcolm
Gillis told the ``Chronicle''.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But if Rice University had been so haughty and
serious about its athletic commitments, maybe the old Southwest
Conference would still be together.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a grudge game now, they're saying down in Houston. The
Hatfields and the McTraitors. Two longtime rivals _ TCU joined the
SWC in 1923, Rice in 1915 _ who might possibly be meeting on the
football field for the final time in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be our most difficult game so far,'' Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione, meanwhile, has nothing but praise for the
mini-miracle that Hatfield has put together at Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good coach,'' Franchione said. ``When you play Ken's
teams, you have to beat them, because you know that they won't beat
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione contends that he thought the Owls would be in the
thick of the WAC hunt even before Rice's current four-game win
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a different team when they're at home on the turf,''
he said. ``And I don't know why exactly that is.''
</P>
<P>
   He means Rice Stadium, of course, a gallows of a college
football home. With its worn turf and its rusted plumbing, the old
stadium abounds in Midnight Express decor.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatfield's Owls have reveled in it. Rice has won 12 of its
13 WAC home games, including its past eight. In addition, Rice's
current crop of seniors has never lost to a TCU team, either at
home or in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's true. Tomorrow those two perennial Darrell Royal
punchlines, Rice and TCU, will meet in a football game of
late-October significance.
</P>
<P>
   A big game, in spite of all the years it wasn't.

HACKETT CHALLENGES SENIORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It just hasn't gotten any easier this week for
USC's seniors.
</P>
<P>
   After being publicly criticized by coach Paul Hackett on Tuesday
for their ``inconsistency,'' they were scolded again Wednesday in a
seniors-only meeting with Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be more explaining of what he meant
(Tuesday), but I think it was good,'' free safety David Gibson
said. ``He wasn't saying we were losing, but that the senior class
has to play well and show leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw up the records in the last three years and said we
haven't done anything. Our goal is to improve from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of Thursday's practice, Hackett and the
coaching staff left the field so the seniors could address the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said some things, but talk is cheap,'' Gibson said. ``We
have to get out and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight starts: Sophomore Darryl Knight, who was playing tight
end as recently as two weeks ago, will make his first career start
at weakside linebacker against Stanford in place of Markus Steele,
who is nursing a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good week of practice this week and a good week last
week,'' Hackett said of Knight.
</P>
<P>
   But the move isn't quite as dramatic as it sounds, because
Hackett expects Steele to play as much against Stanford as if he
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting him to be fresher, because he was off his legs
the past week,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Steele has torn tissue in his left shoulder and will require
surgery after the season but is not expected to miss any games. He
isn't starting because he sat out this week's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Troy Polamalu was a candidate to start, but Hackett
said he is doubtful because he took a hard hit in the Notre Dame
game.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Donta Kendrick will miss the game with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Windrell Hayes said he was fine and not bothered
after aggravating a sprained ankle Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Punting problems: Hackett said he will not make a change at
punter, going with Mike MacGillivray, but his job security sounds
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stick with Mike, but Mike knows his (job) is on the
line,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   MacGillivray averaged 50.6 yards per kick against Arizona two
weeks ago, but 35.4 against Notre Dame, including an 11-yard punt
in the second half.

TOUGH SEASON FOR UCLA'S FARMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time last year, UCLA receiver Danny Farmer
had 33 catches for 659 yards. This year, he has 19 catches for 432
yards. He's missed two games because of a sprained ankle. He's
struggling to adjust to a quarterback not named Cade McNown, and
he's disappointed in UCLA's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to spend a senior season?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have as many losses this year as we did the last two years
combined,'' he said, quietly. ``Things are a little sour now.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's latest problem is a strained groin. He didn't practice
this week and is questionable for Saturday's game at Oregon State,
but he remains optimistic about the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to have fun, since there's only so many games
left,'' he said. ``It's always difficult with a new quarterback,
but I think it's made me a better receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to concentrate more, run better routes and make sure
I'm open so Cory (Paus) can see me. It's actually made me a lot
better. I can see it watching tapes from last year and this year.''
</P>
<P>
   On tape, perhaps, but not in the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: UCLA's daily medical report is so long coach Bob
Toledo ordered a rare no-pad practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most beat-up and sick I've ever seen a team this
late,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fullbacks Durell Price, Matt Stanley and Adam Geitner are either
hurt or sick or tired. One tight end, Mike Seidman, is out and
Bryan Fletcher is questionable. Receiver Freddie Mitchell is
hobbling. Farmer's questionable. Tailback DeShaun Foster and
cornerback Jason Bell are out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as low (on manpower) as we've been since I've been
here,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Parting shot: Cal linebacker Sekou Sanyika is more impressed
with Washington, the Bears' upcoming opponent, than he was with
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Washington) is much more physical than UCLA,'' Sanyika told
reporters. ``(The Huskies) like to hit people, and they don't shy
away from contact like some of the guys from UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup changes: Redshirt freshman Lovell Houston will start at
strong safety in place of senior Eric Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovell is like the quarterback: He's very inexperienced,''
Toledo said. ``He's going to make some mistakes, but that's the
only way you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Ryan Nece has retained his starting job, but he'll
split time with freshman Marcus Reese, who specializes in pass
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Homecoming: UCLA's only Oregon native is reserve left tackle
Bryce Bohlander, a true freshman from Keizer, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander expected to redshirt when he arrived for training
camp, but injuries and disabled-parking suspensions left the Bruins
one tackle short. He plays 20-25 snaps per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't want to play,'' he said. ``I thought I'd get
killed out there weighing 265 pounds. I didn't think I'd be good
enough to hold my own. But now, looking back on it, it's kind of
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Review of the week: Defensive tackle Pete Holland was overloaded
academically this week and did not review a book.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Toledo postponed naming captains until tonight's
team meeting, hoping someone would emerge. ``We need some
leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are the least-penalized team in the Pac-10, but
they've committed the most turnovers (21) and have the worst
third-down defense: Opponents are converting 42 percent of their
third-down attempts.
</P>
<P>
   There's no official kickoff time for the UCLA-Arizona game Oct.
30 at the Rose Bowl. Yes, it could be a night game.

SERIES COVERAGE: NO NEED TO DUMB IT DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joe Morgan, whose media resume includes authorship
of ``Baseball for Dummies,'' hates to think he'll have to dumb down
his commentary just because it's World Series time. Sure, a few
more casual fans out there in TV land will stumble upon the
network's coverage while flipping around for ``Freaks and Geeks''
and suddenly feel like, well, idiots.
</P>
<P>
   So be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think first and foremost, your job is to do the game,''
Morgan said Thursday. ``There's a medium in there some place where
you make sure the casual fan isn't bombarded with things he's not
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   PC answer. But if conventional broadcast wisdom is simply to
pacify the masses, we're not interested in NBC's coverage of the
World Series, which starts Saturday in Atlanta between the Braves
and Yankees. Especially not after the way Morgan and Bob Costas
schooled the audience during the just-completed NLCS, breaking down
the thinking between the Mets' and Braves' strategists to enhance
an already high-quality visual broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's thinking should continue to be: Do the game as if the
viewers already know something and eventually _ hopefully _ raise
their level of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   With Morgan and Costas, that shouldn't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy into the notion that if it happened five minutes
ago, people have already forgotten about it,'' said Costas, often
criticized for being too much a baseball purist with historical
references dropped into his play-by-play. ``There are things you
can fill in during lulls in the action that will enhance the drama
and set the context. It's good for casual and non-casual viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Bob Uecker bowed out of the NBC postseason booth a few
years back, some have complained that the network broadcasts have
lost some fun, that it's become too literal with Morgan and Costas'
high-level banter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the NLCS, when some of the lefty-righty pitching and
hitting moves made by Bobby Valentine and Bobby Cox needed some
subtext. Morgan and Costas fit right in. Someone like Uecker would
have just gotten in the way.
</P>
<P>
   The problem will be if the Yankees-Braves series doesn't supply
the same kind of drama, and Costas and Morgan are forced to rely on
their humor to get the audience through a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Costas may already be warming up his lounge act. When asked on a
media conference call about how he changes to accommodate the
casual viewer, he replied: ``My question has always been: If the
casual fan is in jeans lounging around watching the game, maybe
even wearing a cardigan, does it mean the serious fan puts on a tux
to watch the game?''
</P>
<P>
   No, but it also doesn't mean the broadcasters should provide a
straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Not-so-high anxiety: The upper levels of the new Staples Center
may not be the best place to see or hear a Bruce Springsteen
concert, but as Bob Miller noted on the Kings' opening telecast
from the new downtown arena Wednesday, the view from above makes
for better hockey watching, especially when compared to sightlines
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   For the broadcast, four booths for TV and radio have been built
along the west sideline, planted just above the three-tiered skybox
level, about 60 feet up from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Forum, we had a lower angle, and in situations where
there'd be a scramble around net, a lot of times players would
screen me from a view of the puck,'' said Miller. ``But now we're
looking down on it, and it's a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox provided the Kings with their largest single home telecast
ever Wednesday, using 13 cameras (up from about eight) and a
multitude of tape machines.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty pleasures: OK, so the action is scripted. But if the man
behind the mike doesn't know what's going to happen and calls it
that way, can he at least maintain his status as legit
sportscaster?
</P>
<P>
   Making no apologies for his latest assignment, longtime L.A.
radio and TV sportsguy Rory Markas has been calling the action for
the second season of ``WSL RollerJam'' (usually back-to-back
one-hour episodes Fridays at 9 p.m. on The Nashville Network).
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it just as if I was calling a game,'' said the USC radio
play-by-play man who recently finished taping the 40-show season in
Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla. ``I stayed out of the meetings so I
wouldn't know what was going on. You just take it for what it is.
It's been a lot of fun and I was able to work in some funny lines
that I normally couldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Markas purposely avoided sneaking in the famed ``Whoa Nellie,''
Dick Lane's signature call when he did Roller Derby for TV in the
'50s. But maybe he could have used it during matches that included
the California Quakes, which feature the three-female team called
``The Bod Squad.'' One of the three is the blonde, pony-tailed
Jamie Connimack, who, like Markas, is a Calabasas High alum.
</P>
<P>
   Another show of this genre that has been using ``real''
sportscasters is the syndicated ``Battle Dome'' (locally on
KCOP-Channel 13, Sundays at 9 p.m.), which takes ``American
Gladiators'' to another level (whether better or worse is your
decision). On the play call is Steve Albert, who's doing the
blow-by-bite call of Saturday's Mike Tyson-Orlin Norris bout for
Showtime. Scott Ferrall, the gravel-voice, syndicated-radio
sports-talk host who left to work games for the NHL's Atlanta
Thrashers, pops up on color.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Randy Rosenbloom did the ``Heroes of Wrestling''
from Bay St. Louis, Miss., a national pay-per-view event that
included stars from the '80s such as King Kong Bundy, George ``The
Animal'' Steele and the Iron Sheik. But even for $19.95, a lack of
buyers will likely keep this one-time event from becoming a regular
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the show would do better with there (being) such an
interest in wrestling now, but the fans (at the event) were only
into it at times,'' said Rosenbloom, who will soon go to another
extreme on the intelligence scale when he does the Harvard-Yale
football game for DirecTV next month.
</P>
<P>
   Events for the freaks and geeks aren't looked down upon by
broadcasters such as Rosenbloom. Of course, they pay bills, but
they also provide an event in which to work on your play-by-play
skills and one that might evolve into a fringe-sport cult
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be headstrong these days and think everything is
football, baseball and basketball,'' said the North Hollywood
resident, whose career highlight is doing beach volleyball for NBC
during the '96 Summer Olympics. ``Times have changed. You've got to
be willing to do these and take some risks.'' &QL;

FLORES NEARS 2,000-WIN MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ARCADIA _ A content and somewhat shy David Flores ended
Thursday just two wins shy of the 2,000-victory mark on North
American thoroughbred tracks.
</P>
<P>
   He's looking forward to hitting the mark by Saturday, when he'll
be aboard Prime Timber in the $250,000 Grade II Oak Tree Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Flores and Prime Timber drew the outside post for Saturday's
race, which will feature a nine-horse field. Flores is confident
that Prime Timber will fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That horse ran impressively last time,'' the jockey said.
``Hopefully, he'll break good from that spot. I'll see what
(trainer Bob Baffert) tells me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The confidence is well-earned. After all, Flores, 31, has had a
very good 1999. His mounts have earned $10.1 million in 1,001
starts through the beginning of the week. He has won 182 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a good horse, you look good,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores' professional riding career began in the early 1980s at
Agua Caliente in Tijuana, but any wins he had there don't count in
his overall total.
</P>
<P>
   Through Thursday, Flores was the leading rider at Oak Tree with
20 victories.
</P>
<P>
   But, Flores, who began riding in Sonora, Mexico, at age 8,
admits he will be glad when the 2,000-win mark is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough colony of jockeys,'' Flores said. ``I just
want to break my 2,000. It's a gift that I've gotten this far. I'm
lucky to be here because I love what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Top trainer: Halfway through Oak Tree, the best winning
percentage by a trainer isn't held by anybody named Baffert,
Mandella, Lukas, or even Spawr.
</P>
<P>
   It's Doug Peterson. Going into Thursday's race card, Peterson
horses were winners in five of the 10 races in which they were
entered. Seven of the 10 finished in the money.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who is recovering from recent surgery, says the
success is due in large part to good fortune and teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   `I try to keep my horses in the worst company and myself in the
best company,'' Peterson joked.
</P>
<P>
   Four of his five wins have come in combination with jockey Matt
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what the magic is, but (Garcia and I) did
win four in a row,'' Peterson said. `Matt has a God-given talent on
a horse that many people don't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Feature winner: Dianehill won Thursday's Oak Tree feature,
overcoming several horses with a late stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   With the win in the 6{-furlong race for fillies and mares,
Dianehill paid $3.60, $2.60 and $2.20.
</P>
<P>
   Early favorite Honest Lady was scratched from the race Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Former Santa Anita Clerk of Scales Dean Scarborough died Tuesday
morning. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime minor league baseball player, Scarborough coached and
managed in the Pacific Coast League. He began his racing career at
Caliente in the 1960s. He retired from Santa Anita in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A viewing will be held Sunday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Memory
Garden Memorial Park in Brea. Burial will be Monday at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is beginning to take its toll on jockeys riding at
Santa Anita. Corey Nakatani, suffering from heat exhaustion, was
taken off his mounts after the third race Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the up-side, he celebrated his 29th birthday on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Laffit Pincay entered Thursday 31 wins away from tying
Bill Shoemaker's record of all-time wins. He was not named to any
horses Thursday and will not ride today.

AYALA TRYING TO AVOID PITFALLS OF TITLE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Even before he steps into the ring tomorrow
night to face Saohin Srithai Condo, World Boxing Association
bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala has secured a place in Fort
Worth's boxing history.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the World Boxing Association 118-pound title from
Johnny Tapia on June 26, Ayala became the newest area champion. But
when he defends his title for the first time, he will be fighting
to break from a history that has staggered three homegrown
champions before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they look back on me I want them to say I was a good
fighter,'' Ayala said. ``Long-term, I would like to stay undefeated
for the rest of my boxing career and be a great champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined, however, is how Ayala will fit into Fort
Worth's boxing lore. Will he join Donald Curry, who held a world
title for most of a seven-year span beginning in 1983? Or will he
lose his belt quickly, as Gene Hatcher, Stevie Cruz and Troy Dorsey
did?
</P>
<P>
   Even before Ayala steps into the ring Saturday, he must try to
muster the hunger that won him the title and avoid the distractions
of fighting in front of a hometown crowd. A history of strange
first title defenses for the area's past champions also seems to
hang over Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield's Dorsey won the International Boxing Federation
featherweight (126-pound) title on June 3, 1991, with a first-round
knockout against Alfred Rangel of San Antonio in Las Vegas. But
Dorsey's first defense proved disastrous. Fatigued and bleeding, he
lost a decision against Manuel Medina in Inglewood, Calif., only
two months later.]
</P>
<P>
   ``When I defended the title I had problems making weight,''
Dorsey said. ``I spent so much time in the sauna and not eating
that after the fourth round, I had no energy. I was out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big mistake was that I didn't eat enough. I would have one
meal a day; I'm talking a baked potato or a plate of rice.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice to Ayala is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't lay back just because you're the champion,'' Dorsey
said. ``Let him know you are the champion. You can't let the
distractions of fighting at home get you out of your fight,
remember the hunger that got you here.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending his title at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum proved to
be somewhat of a disadvantage for former WBA featherweight champion
Stevie Cruz, who lost to Antonio Esparragoza on a 12th-round
technical knockout in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bundle of nerves,'' said Cruz, who had upset the
unbeaten Barry McGuigan of Ireland for the belt. ``It didn't
motivate me a whole lot to fight at home. I was going against the
No. 1 contender and it played on my mind. But it sounds like
Paulie's confident, and it will work in his favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ayala: ``There is no nervousness. I am ready to fight. It's
taken me a long time to get my world title.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hatcher, who won the WBA junior welterweight (140-pound)
title against Johnny Bumphus in June 1984, said that positive
attitude will aid Ayala in quest for a successful defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a defense you don't let the negative overrun the positive
attitude, '' said Hatcher, who needed 15 rounds to win his first
title defense against Argentina's Ubaldo Nestor Sacco in 1984 in
Fort Worth then lost a rematch seven months later. ``In that first
defense, that is a big thing. I just went out there with a positive
attitude, and that's what Paulie needs to stay with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Paulie has going is his hunger. I can see it on his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala was out of the gym for only two weeks after he defeated
Tapia and is determined to win, said Henry Mendez, one of Ayala's
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie has worked harder than ever,'' Mendez said. ``Knowing
that he is the champion and knowing that people want what he's got
has made him work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran boxing manager David Gorman, who worked with Ayala as an
amateur and is linked to several of Fort Worth's professional
champions, knows first-hand the difficulties of a first world title
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The champion must fight in his first title defense as if it is
his last bout, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way of telling if it can happen again,'' Gorman
said. ``All you can do is prepare the best you know how, and defend
your title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody plans on losing a title on the first defense. It's the
last thing on your mind.'' / nn
