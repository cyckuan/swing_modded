<HEADLINE> Cutting-Edge Surgery Saves Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A newborn who would have been unable to breathe
because a cyst was growing in her lungs has gone home healthy,
weeks after a cutting-edge operation was performed in mid-delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Children's Hospital delivered and operated on Sarah
Savage over five hours March 22. The team of 20 doctors, nurses and
technicians performed a modified Caesarean section, bringing out
only the baby's head and shoulders at first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't remove the mass fast enough in a normal
delivery,'' said Dr. Russell Jennings, director of fetal surgery.
''There would have been no way to get the kid to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons examined the cyst and put the baby on a heart-lung
machine before fully delivering her. They then cut the umbilical
cord and removed the cyst, which was benign.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah's condition had caused fluid to build in her lungs and in
the mother's womb, causing Lucie Savage to go into labor more than
a month early.
</P>
<P>
   Savage and her husband, John, took Sarah home Friday. ''We're
ready for her at home. We can't wait,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Marine Death Case  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Testimony in the court-martial of a
Marine captain who led a hike that resulted in the heatstroke death
of a reservist ended with defense attorneys questioning the role of
a sergeant who helped lead the hike.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys for Capt. Victor Arana suggested that Sgt.
William Hornsby urged an exhausted Lance Cpl. Giuseppe ''Joey''
Leto to continue the hike and berated other Marines for performing
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn., died after the July 7 night
march in 80-degree heat at Camp Lejeune. Arana, 28, of Chicago, is
charged with dereliction of duty and failure to obey an order.
</P>
<P>
   The military judge who will decide the case scheduled closing
arguments for this morning after defense attorneys ended their case
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Arana faces a maximum sentence of nine months in prison and
dismissal from the Marines if convicted of both charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses testified that Arana continued to push the
troops despite complaints and questions from other hike
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Arana, who testified Thursday, said he did not realize there
were so many stragglers until the hike was more than half
completed. He said he considered calling in trucks to take the
Marines the rest of the way to their overnight bivouac, but instead
decided to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after the hike, following a head count that prompted a
search for him, Leto was found dead.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Cpl. Ted Casler testified Friday that he heard Leto tell
others he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard him say, 'I can't make it. I can't go any further,'''
Casler testified. ''Sergeant Hornsby then said, 'Grab my pack,' and
dragged him (piggyback) back to the formation.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hornsby's platoon assembled at the bivouac area, he
berated his men for their performance and ordered them to turn
their shirts inside out, saying they were unworthy to wear Marine
uniforms, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was upset about the hike,'' said Pfc. Jesus Romero. ''A lot
of people fell out. Some sat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby testified Arana set a hiking pace that was too fast.
Prosecutors said the hike was to have been conducted at a
2{-miles-an-hour pace, but the company was marched at a
3.7-miles-per-hour rate the first three miles.

<HEADLINE> Senate Backs $1.8 Trillion Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The $1.83 trillion budget for 2001 approved by
the Senate will let both parties draw election-year contrasts with
each other, but leaves major policy changes for the next president
to make.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of debate, the Senate approved the
Republican-written package Friday mostly along party lines in a
51-45 vote. While it contains less domestic spending and deeper tax
cuts than President Clinton wants, it makes no fundamental changes
in the shape or scope of government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a presidential election,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the plan's chief author.
''And somebody next year, a new president, will tell us what
changes they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush has proposed a
$483 billion tax cut for 2002 through 2006, more than the Senate
budget plans. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee, is likely to prefer a smaller tax reduction and more
domestic spending than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's passage puts the GOP on track to move a final
House-Senate compromise through Congress next week.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need Clinton's signature, sets broad
tax and spending targets but leaves details for later legislation.
Those bills will become political battlegrounds as the two parties
draw contrasts over school spending, cutting married couples' taxes
and dozens of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wasted little time in attacking the GOP plan, accusing
Republicans of crafting a plan that ''undermines our efforts to
strengthen Social Security and Medicare, makes it harder to pay off
the debt and rests on dramatic cuts in education, law enforcement,
the environment and efforts to promote peace and national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''Let's put this empty political document aside and
work together to keep America on a responsible fiscal course that
meets our nation's long-term challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP package had called for a five-year tax cut of at least
$150 billion. But by 51-49, the Senate voted to strip $2.7 billion
out of that tax reduction and use the money to increase spending
for Pell college grants for low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Senate's 45 Democrats on that vote were GOP Sens.
Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of
Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont, John McCain of Arizona and Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   That vote and several others signaled that as the budget is
translated into real dollars later this year, members of both
parties will be hard-pressed to resist the temptation of spending
more money. In a long day of votes Friday, for example, the Senate
signaled its desire to boost spending for biomedical research,
victims of Hurricane Floyd, veterans and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of next year's budget leaves unresolved the billions
of dollars Clinton and many lawmakers want to provide right away
for U.S. peacekeeping in Kosovo, drug-fighting in Colombia and
rebuilding from Floyd. Work on spending bills actually to provide
that money is likely to begin this month or next.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the budget's most dramatic feature, Congress would
use projected Social Security surpluses to pay down $1 trillion
worth of the $3.6 trillion publicly held debt over the next five
years. Clinton would do the same thing, plus add several billion
more from surpluses from the rest of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   If achieved, which seems plausible, debt reduction of that
magnitude could gird the economy by pushing interest rates
downward. Lawmakers would have accomplished a feat seen as fantasy
in the not too distant days of federal deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt totals $5.7 trillion, of which the government
owes $3.6 trillion to the public and $2.1 trillion to the Social
Security and other federal trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP spending plan would set aside $311 billion for defense
spending next year, $5 billion more than Clinton's proposal.
Domestic programs would get $290 billion, about $30 billion less
than the president wants.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the budget covers automatically paid benefits like
Social Security plus interest payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans set aside up to $40 billion for setting up a
Medicare prescription drug benefit, which Clinton has proposed and
GOP leaders say they also favor. But their budget does not require
the new program or propose specifics.
</P>
<P>
   On the budget's final passage, Chafee and Sen. George Voinovich,
R-Ohio, joined 43 Democrats in voting ''no.'' McCain and Sens.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah; Harry Reid, D-Nev.; and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., did not vote.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Loophole Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax-exempt political organizations should be
forced to disclose contributors and expenditures, a bipartisan
group of lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Without such a requirement, the organizations enjoy one of the
''brashest, boldest loopholes'' in campaign finance law, critics
charged Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another compelling argument for campaign finance
reform,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ''Americans should be
outraged at this latest manifestation of corruption in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are tax-exempt groups organized under Section 527 of
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   The law is more than 25 years old, but the law has recently been
employed by political organizations of every stripe after court
decisions and an IRS opinion paved the way. A loophole in the law
allows groups organized under Section 527 not to disclose their
contributions or spending.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made campaign finance central to his recent losing
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Sen. Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., McCain's partner in the Senate in pushing for
extensive change in campaign finance laws, said activities of
Section 527 organizations amount to ''election advertising dressed
up to avoid the election laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 organizations are involved in political causes and
campaigns across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a group with Republican ties called Shape the
Debate is running TV ads critical of Vice President Al Gore in
California, New York and Washington. Another called Citizens for
Better Medicare, created by drug manufacturers and their allies,
plans to spend millions of dollars to attack legislation that would
control prescription prices.
</P>
<P>
   The group Common Cause, relying on media accounts, released a
report Friday showing a dozen Section 527 groups, including
Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, Citizens for Reform,
Saving America's Families Everyday and Republicans for Clean Air,
which stirred the presidential campaign with TV ads praising Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record and criticizing
then-rival McCain's.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers are pushing bills that would require the
groups to submit financial information to the Federal Election
Commission and detail their existence to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation faces hurdles. GOP members of the House Ways and
Means Committee voted Thursday against attempts to attach the
measure as an amendment to a tax bill. They argued that it should
await broader campaign finance legislation so as not to drag down
an underlying bill that would expand taxpayer rights and give
people breaks on IRS penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters urged fellow members to pass the measure, which they
hope to get to the House floor next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is high time Congress shines the light on 527s and tells
special-interest groups that the American people are our special
interest,'' said Rep. Dennis Moore, D-Kan.

<HEADLINE> Georgia O'Keeffe Works Go on View  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An intimate view of the mature Georgia
O'Keeffe, one of America's great 20th century artists, opens Sunday
at the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Phillips Collection mounted a major exhibit of
O'Keeffe's canvases. On Sunday the National Gallery brings her back
to Washington with 53 pictures, all on paper -- watercolors,
charcoal drawings and pastels done with a kind of colored chalk.
</P>
<P>
   The show covers only work that she did after a major change in
her style after 1915.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe used up a lot of paper in her long career. She made
hundreds if not thousands of sketches, many if not most of which
have disappeared. Dealers might pay millions now for the early work
that she put out with the trash one night in New York more than 80
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth E. Fine, the gallery's curator of modern drawings, was
impressed with O'Keeffe's lifelong devotion to what she sees as the
intimacy of art on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided that what we wanted was to show just her finished
work,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, O'Keeffe mailed some charcoal drawings on paper to a
New York friend to show the kind of work she was doing. Though she
had won an important prize for a realistic painting of a dead
rabbit and a copper pot, she had stopped doing realistic work and
wanted to be rid of her old style.
</P>
<P>
   She had turned to abstract images -- lines and forms that could
not be certainly identified with anything in nature.
</P>
<P>
   The friend took the drawings to photographer Alfred Stieglitz.
O'Keeffe had visited his famous Fifth Avenue art gallery, known
from its address as the ''291,'' but did not know him well. She was
later to become his wife and the model for a famous series of nude
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Abstract art was a hot novelty in 1916 and Stieglitz was
enthusiastic. He put her work into a show at his gallery, and the
college teacher from the South found herself a well-known New York
artist at 29. She had embarked on a new style.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sent for things I had left in Texas,'' she wrote later.
''They came in a barrel and among them were all my old drawings and
paintings. I put them in with the wastepaper trash to throw away
and that night when ... I came home after dark the paintings and
drawings were blowing all over the street. We left them there and
went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new abstract work on paper had non-committal titles like
''No. 7 Special'' and ''Early No. 2.'' No one could say with
certainty what they represented -- if anything. O'Keeffe said she
was expressing ''things that I had no words for.''
</P>
<P>
   Stieglitz wrote an article emphasizing what he saw as the
interest of her work from the point of view of psychoanalysis --
Sigmund Freud and his ideas about sex and psychology were also new.
Other critics found O'Keeffe's pictures to be symbols of female
sexuality, even pornographic, despite the lack of realism.
</P>
<P>
   One critic wrote later that she was ''spiritualizing her sex''
and that when women felt strongly it was ''through the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe was impatient with that kind of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''What if it is children and love in paint?'' she asked. ''What
does it matter if the its origin is emotional or aesthetic?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, Freud is reported to have
said.
</P>
<P>
   For many years -- she died in 1996 at 98 -- O'Keeffe did both
realistic work and abstractions. But after the criticism, she was
more inclined to relate her abstractions to identifiable objects.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''O'Keeffe on Paper'' will be at the National Gallery of Art
through July 9, and at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.
M. July 29-Oct. 29.

<HEADLINE> Medicare May Raise Nursing Home Pay  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Health Care Financing Administration
proposed raising Medicare payment rates for nursing homes by almost
6 percent and directing more money toward the care of acutely ill
seniors who need expensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare program administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said payment
rates would increase by 5.8 percent starting Oct. 1 under a
proposal that was published for public comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA's plan calls for categories of payments that would make
more funds available for nursing home residents with multiple
serious health problems that require intensive care and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''These changes, based on extensive research of real world
experiences, will ensure that Medicare pays nursing homes fairly
and appropriately for caring for those beneficiaries with complex
medical needs,'' DeParle said.
</P>
<P>
   The rate hike would translate to an estimated $15.5 billion for
nursing homes in fiscal year 2001, an increase of more $900 million
over the current year's allocations.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would pay more than $700 per day for seniors who
require the most expensive care under the proposed changes. That's
more than five times the rate for residents who don't require
intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Government auditors and private experts have warned that unless
some cuts in Medicare financial support cuts are restored, the
sickest senior citizens may be denied the care they need.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts in Medicare spending have led to a shortfall in money to
cover care of the most expensive patients. Older Americans with
serious illnesses sometimes can't find nursing homes or home health
care agencies that will care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Congress restored some Medicare funds as part of the Balanced
Budget Refinement Act of 1999. HCFA's proposal would refine the
payment system and direct more money toward caring for acutely ill
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The rate updates are based on increases in the cost of covered
care, changes in local wages and provisions of the balanced budget
act, HCFA said.

<HEADLINE> States To Reconsider Medicaid Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States must sign back up poor families that
were improperly dropped from Medicaid when they left welfare and
were urged to pay any medical bills the families incurred while
they were terminated from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor, who have long complained that people
were being dropped from Medicaid even though they were eligible,
said Friday's announcement by the federal agency that runs Medicaid
was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been hundreds of thousands improperly terminated
from Medicaid,'' said Jonathan Stein, a lawyer with Community Legal
Services in Philadelphia, which provides legal assistance to low
income people.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration told states in a letter
to do extensive searches of computer files to identify families
that lost Medicaid coverage when they got off welfare and take
''action to reinstate coverage ... as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also says states must correct whatever problems or
policies that led to eligible people being cut off.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an acknowledgment on the part of the federal
government that many people have been improperly kept off Medicaid
and the strongest step yet taken to correct the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking all states to review their computer systems and
eligibility processes -- in order to ensure that all families that
are eligible to keep their Medicaid benefits really do keep them,''
Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
said at a children's health insurance conference.
</P>
<P>
   States were also ordered to reinstate disabled children who were
required to get Medicaid after they lost their supplemental Social
Security benefits, but didn't. Experts estimate that at least
100,000 children were eligible for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the federal government will help states pay
administrative expenses and will match any state dollars used to
reimburse families for medical bills that would have been covered
by Medicaid during the time they were terminated.
</P>
<P>
   States are not required to reimburse families for those bills,
however.
</P>
<P>
   HHS auditors concluded last year that many people were being
improperly dropped from Medicaid because states didn't tell people
that they were still eligible for Medicaid, caseworkers discouraged
families applying for Medicaid, and computer systems that linked
welfare coverage and Medicaid wiped out people when they got off
the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have already started to identify people who should
have been allowed to keep Medicaid coverage. Frank Lopez, spokesman
for the Arizona Medicaid program, said his department has just
started a program to reinstate families who were kicked off because
caseworkers didn't tell them that they could still be covered even
if they were no longer on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all should have done a better job of informing people,''
said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid enrollment dropped about 200,000 to 41.4 million in
1998, the last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   The federal-state program, which provides health benefits for
low-income Americans, cost an estimated $181 billion last year --
the federal government's share was $103 billion.
</P>
<P>
   HHS officials could not provide estimates of how many people
have been improperly kicked off Medicaid. But studies suggest that
hundreds of thousands of people lost Medicaid coverage as they left
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 study by Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that
lobbies for universal health coverage, estimated that 675,000
people lost Medicaid coverage in 1997 and had no health insurance
because of the improper cutoffs, adding to concerns about the
number of Americans with no coverage, which totals at least 44
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, president of Families USA, applauded the
announcement but warned that many states have so far resisted
making changes that would have kept many people from getting kicked
off Medicaid in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very much on the right track,'' said Pollack. ''But does
it mean states will fulfill their obligation? That's something
we'll have to monitor very carefully.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Earnings Test Ended  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of Americans age 65
through 69 will be able to earn as much money as they want without
losing Social Security benefits under a bill signed Friday by
President Clinton repealing a Depression-era penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of the so-called earnings test will mean a
bonanza averaging an additional $6,700 in payments this year for
some 800,000 recipients who are working and another 100,000 who
haven't sought benefits because they have jobs, the Social Security
Administration says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the repeal was retroactive to Jan. 1, meaning that
about 415,000 seniors who lost Social Security benefits this year
will receive a refund. It will average $3,500 and be mailed out in
May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conventional wisdom says that nothing important happens in
Washington in an election year,'' Clinton said at a ceremony
Friday. ''Today we have proved the conventional wisdom wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure repealed a law in which people age 65 to 69 lost $1
in Social Security benefits for every $3 in wages above an annual
limit of $17,000. The cost of the repeal was estimated at $22
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings penalty was a remnant from an era of high
unemployment when policy-makers wanted to encourage older Americans
to retire and make room for younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   But today's booming economy and tight labor market have changed
the picture. Clinton said the repeal would benefit workers and
companies alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means companies with labor shortages will have a fresh
supply of experienced workers, increasing our ability to grow
without inflation,'' Clinton said. ''In the future, it will mean
more baby boomers working longer, contributing more to the tax base
and to the Social Security trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats and Republicans both eagerly courting the senior
vote, the repeal sailed through Congress without dissent, approved
by a 100-0 vote in the Senate and by 422-0 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Common sense has finally prevailed,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''For too many years, America's working
seniors have been getting penalized. Starting today they will get
the paycheck they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that one in four Americans between 65 and 69 has at
least a part-time job, and that 80 percent of the baby boomers say
they intend to work past 65.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is the largest federal benefit program, sending
checks to 44 million Americans. Besides payments to retirees,
Social Security also makes payments to disabled people and to
survivors of workers who die young.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also unveiled a new Internet service offered by the
Social Security Administration for younger Americans who want to
get an online estimate of future retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest estimate, ''quick calculator,'' asks only for a
person's age and current-year earnings. The most sophisticated
requires users to download software onto their home computers and
allows them to try out various retirement scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The new online retirement calculators will not tap into private
records that Social Security keeps about individuals' work and
earnings histories. They rely solely on information provided by
online users.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the signing ceremony to press Congress for
legislation that would use interest savings on the debt to extend
the life of the Social Security trust fund to 2054.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of us would like to do more,'' Clinton said. ''We may not
be able to do more in an election year where there are genuine and
honest differences between the two parties and even within the
parties about how to proceed.''

<HEADLINE> Closing Arguments in Marine Case  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain charged in the
heatstroke death of a reservist continued to push his troops in a
hike despite repeated warnings that his troops were straggling,
prosecutors said during closing arguments of his court-martial this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Victor Arana violated standard operating procedures for
such conditioning hikes and showed a careless disregard for his
men, Maj. Chris Hamilton told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was like a horse with blinders on...,'' Hamilton said. ''He
was head down, focused forward. There was absolutely no supervision
of that conditioning hike.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana, 28, of Chicago, is charged with dereliction of duty and
failure to obey an order in the death of Lance Cpl. Giuseppe
''Joey'' Leto. Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn., died of heatstroke
following the July 7 night march in 80-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Arana faces a maximum sentence of nine months in prison and
dismissal from the Marines if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   His defense attorneys argued this morning that Arana was a
rookie company commander in charge of the unit for only 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stevens said Arana did not receive proper instructions from
his superiors and delegated authority to his non-commissioned
officers as allowed in standard operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that there were some judgment and leadership
errors made on this hike,'' Stevens said. ''All judgment errors and
leadership errors do not equate to criminal liability. Good
judgment comes from experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He expected his staff to follow his orders and directions,''
Stevens said. ''His staff failed him that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana testified Thursday that he didn't realize there were so
many stragglers until the hike was more than half completed. He
said he considered calling in trucks to take the Marines the rest
of the way, but instead decided to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said in his closing argument that Arana failed to
initiate and maintain radio contact with the officer supervising
the hike. One reason, he said, was that Arana was outpacing his own
radio operator.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the lack of radio contact, Arana could have easily
checked the condition of his troops, Hamilton said, ''All he needed
to do was turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   There were three heat casualties during the second leg of the
hike, not including Leto; all three Marines had body temperatures
higher than 103 degrees, Hamilton. He said Leto was seen vomiting
at the first rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hike, Leto wandered more than half a mile from
the area, and Arana failed to obtain a proper head count or weapons
count, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this negligent conduct does not meet the standard of
due care that is expected of a company commander to ensure the
safety and welfare of his marines,'' Hamilton told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the court-martial ended Friday with defense
attorneys questioning the role of a sergeant who helped lead the
hike.
</P>
<P>
   Arana's attorneys presented testimony suggesting that Sgt.
William Hornsby urged an exhausted Leto to continue the hike and
later berated other Marines for their poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses testified that Arana continued to push the
troops despite complaints and questions from other hike
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after the hike, following a head count that prompted a
search for him, Leto was found dead.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Cpl. Ted Casler testified Friday that he heard Leto tell
others he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard him say, 'I can't make it. I can't go any farther,'''
Casler testified. ''Sergeant Hornsby then said, 'Grab my pack,' and
dragged him (piggyback) back to the formation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hike, Hornsby berated his men for their performance
and ordered them to turn their shirts inside out, saying they were
unworthy to wear Marine uniforms, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was upset about the hike,'' said Pfc. Jesus Romero. ''A lot
of people fell out. Some sat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby testified Arana set a hiking pace that was too fast.
Prosecutors said the hike was to have been conducted at a
2{-miles-an-hour pace, but the company was marched at a
3.7-miles-per-hour rate the first three miles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tax Take at Post WWII High  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For millions of middle-class families singled
out for tax relief by Congress, the federal income tax burden is
hundreds of dollars a year less than it was just four years ago.
Yet the overall U.S. tax take from the economy is higher than at
any time since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans scurry to file their income tax returns before this
year's April 17 deadline, debate rages between Republicans and
Democrats, congressional leaders and President Clinton: Should the
federal budget surplus be used to cut taxes, boost spending or
guarantee that Social Security and Medicare are on sound financial
footing?
</P>
<P>
   What had been a loud, national outcry for tax relief a few years
ago has muted considerably, in part because many middle-class
families are paying less to Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office, for example, estimates that the
total federal tax take on a family of four at the national median
income -- a gross income of about $39,000 last year -- was 18.9
percent in 1999, down from 19.7 percent four years earlier. The
Joint Committee on Taxation puts the 1999 figure for families of
four earning between $40,000 and $50,000 at 16.1 percent, compared
with 17.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Taking only the federal income tax, the Treasury Department
estimates a family of four earning $54,900 in 1999 paid a tax rate
of about 7.5 percent, down from 9.3 percent in 1995 and the lowest
rate for people in the median income group since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their tax burden is lower than it has been, depending on which
measure you use, than any time in the last two decades, or the last
three decades,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers recently told
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for this. President Reagan's huge tax
cuts in 1981 and the tax code overhaul of 1986 removed millions of
lower-income taxpayers from tax rolls and reduced taxes on
high-income people.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, Congress and Clinton have focused tax relief
on the middle class, particularly in the 1997 tax bill that created
the $500-per-child tax credit and credits for education.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a basic decision that underpins much of recent
tax policy: It's really expensive and hard to raise children in
this day and age,'' said Iris Lav, deputy director of the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group focusing
on government's impact on middle- and lower-income people. ''The
thinking is that moderate and upper-middle-class people deserve a
break for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget center's research indicates that middle-income
families are paying $300 to $400 less on average in income taxes in
1999 than they did in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy we have been able to reduce the tax burden on
families with children,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman
of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. ''But that in
itself should not be the gauge of whether the government is taking
too much money out of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The total U.S. government haul in taxes -- income, corporate,
capital gains, gasoline, excise taxes, telecommunications, payroll,
and so on -- amounts to about 20 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product, more than any time since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   To Republican tax cutters, this tax take is a drain on free
enterprise that is providing the government with a huge surplus
just begging to be spent on more programs and more bureaucrats.
Archer cited research showing that business taxes make up 20
percent of the cost of goods and services, a hidden tax on the very
same middle-income people who may be paying less in income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all factors into the fabric of the average worker's life,
even though it might not directly appear on his 1040 form,'' Archer
said. ''We are taking more out of the economy than we need. That
has got to show up in the bills people are paying, and they don't
even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans from Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the party's
presumptive presidential nominee, to Archer are pushing for broad
tax cuts to return some of that surplus to those footing the bill.
Looking at just the income tax, the top 10 percent of earners now
pay 66 percent of the tax -- meaning that broad tax cuts necessarily
benefit wealthier people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The harder you work, the longer you work, the more you pay.
That's wrong in my view,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, however, said the increase in taxes as a percentage of
gross domestic product has been driven mainly by rising capital
gains collections -- primarily on investments from the booming stock
market -- and income from corporate profits. In both cases,
Republicans are open to Democratic attacks that broad tax cuts are
aimed primarily at rich people who do not need them.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York, said the debate comes down to
priorities: Should the surplus in tax collections go back to
taxpayers, or should it be used for modest tax cuts after boosting
spending on education and health care, paying down the national
debt and keeping Social Security and Medicare solvent in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we have lower taxes is good, but you don't keep
money just because some people are paying less,'' Rangel said.
''You ought to find out what your obligations are and take care of
your fiscal problems. This is our chance to do something about
it.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. Asa Hutchinson Unopposed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, the Arkansas Republican
who played a prominent role in last year's impeachment trial of
President Clinton, is unopposed for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Hutchinson never figured to have much of a
struggle winning re-election. He won his second term in 1998 with
80 percent of the vote, and his district chose Republican Bob Dole
over Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of a candidate gave Republicans a chance to taunt
Democrats, some of whom had promised to make impeachment managers
sweat for new terms. ''That's the (Democratic) assault on the
managers,'' chided Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the House GOP
campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Hutchinson, Rep. Jim DeMint, a freshman from South
Carolina, also has escaped Democratic opposition for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Three lawmakers from Tennessee are without major party
opposition, including Democratic Rep. Harold Ford and Republicans
William Jenkins and John Duncan Jr. Duncan will be opposed by an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 31 incumbents -- 17 Democrats, 14 Republicans -- are
without major party opposition thus far, with filing closed in
nearly half the states.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, has shown affection recently for
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the Republican majority. Now, they
are returning the favor.
</P>
<P>
   When Traficant wanted a $35 million allocation for a new
community center in Youngstown, Ohio, on a recent housing bill, the
GOP leadership saw to it that his amendment was allowed on the
House floor. And the GOP rank and file helped pass it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank the Republican leadership for showing a heart
to my people,'' Traficant said on the House floor at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in favor of his proposal was 225-201. Republicans voted
for it by a margin of 129-87. Democrats opposed it, 112-96.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, a lifelong Democrat, has made numerous comments
recently that he might decide to back Hastert for speaker next year
over the Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   With the House narrowly divided, the importance of a potential
switch like Traficant's is magnified.
</P>
<P>
   And the political subtext was unmistakable during debate on the
$35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant noted that the amendment provided money for ''this
significant project that Speaker Hastert has identified as a
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., responded: ''I do not deny that this
whole process speaks to the need of the speaker. I have a pretty
good idea of exactly what that need is in the current political
context.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Traficant delivered something of a lecture
on Democratic affinity for public works projects, including one in
Massachusetts that former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill shepherded to
passage more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now when you built that tunnel up there in Boston and Tip
O'Neill built that tunnel, I did not open my mouth,'' he said in
reference to a project now known as the ''Big Dig.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When that great Tombigbee was built, everybody stepped
aside,'' he added, referring to a multibillion dollar waterway
project in the South that the Democratic leadership also supported.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   It's become customary in recent years for the Senate to whistle
through numerous nonbinding amendments in moments before final
passage of a budget.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Republican Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, sought approval without votes for a package
of 55 such proposals on Friday -- on issues ranging from flood
control to breast cancer -- Sen. Robert C. Byrd objected.
</P>
<P>
   In strong language, the West Virginia Democrat said he did not
want to participate in the ''gang rape of the legislative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd suggested the Senate stay in session as long as necessary
to debate and vote on the proposals. But cooler heads -- and the
desire for a Friday afternoon getaway from the Capitol -- prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The budget passed moments later, without any action on the
nonbinding proposals and without any formal protest from the
numerous senators who had sponsored them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides Congress Again  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton scolded the
Republican-controlled Congress on Saturday for planning a spring
break without first acting on gun safety, a patient's bill of
rights and his other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, he said in his weekly radio address, delay has
real consequences for Americans' health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the president flew New Orleans for a fund-raising
lunch expected to bring in $400,000 for the Democratic National
Committee. He also planned to attend an Easter-season musical
production in Alexandria, La., before returning to Washington early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, Clinton said he was especially concerned
that Congress has not acted on legislation to improve gun safety,
to raise the minimum wage by $1 an hour and to enact ''a strong and
enforceable'' patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''With only a week to go before recess, I ask the congressional
leaders to think about these daily tallies: 12 children dying from
gunfire, thousands of managed-care patients suffering unnecessary
declines in health, millions of working families missing out on a
long-overdue raise,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So let's get back on track,'' he said. ''Let's work together
to protect the health, the safety, the welfare of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the chairman of the Republican National Committee
said that Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have dragged their
feet on tax cuts, balancing the budget and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost eight long years now, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have
obfuscated, stalled, stonewalled, delayed, postponed, hindered,
slowed down, hesitated, held up and obstructed,'' Jim Nicholson
said.
</P>
<P>
   On gun safety, Clinton noted it has been nine months since the
Senate passed a bill to require child safety locks for every
handgun sold, ban the import of large ammunition clips and close
what he called a loophole that allows buyers at gun shows to avoid
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has failed to move beyond that because the House has
not brought the bill to a vote, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, no legislation can prevent every act of gun
violence or every gun accident,'' Clinton said. ''But when there
are simple safety measures we can take -- measures that will save
lives -- there is absolutely no excuse for sitting on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts Jr.,
R-Okla., said the House this week intends to address the issue of
guns with a program called Project Exile that would increase
enforcement of existing gun laws and give states and local
communities more resources to protect people from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the very least that can be done is to produce a
final gun bill by April 20, the first anniversary of the shootings
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, the president said he could sign a patients'
protection bill already passed by the House but that action was
blocked when the Senate passed ''a much weaker bill,''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now both bills have been gathering dust on a shelf for five
months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation is needed to guarantee that patients in
managed care can see specialists when needed and receive the best
medical advice from doctors, not just the cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation Clinton seeks would also guarantee an appeal by
patients in cases of disagreement and grant rights to hold a health
plan accountable ''if it causes them great harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said there has been too much delay in acting on
legislation to increase the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''A dollar an hour -- it may not sound like much -- but in the
seven months that have gone by since our legislation would have
gone into effect, families have lost more than $600 in income,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For hard-pressed families, the cost of congressional delay can
be measured not just by the day, but literally by the hour,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Accuser Stands Accused  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turmoil in the Army's upper ranks, which
became public last week with the disclosure that the
highest-ranking woman had charged a fellow general with sexual
harassment, intensified Saturday as the Pentagon confirmed that Lt.
Gen. Claudia Kennedy herself is now accused of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A senior defense official said Saturday the Defense Department's
Office of Inspector General was notified Friday by a retired Army
officer that ''he was aware of personal misconduct on the part of
General Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the alleged misconduct was not disclosed, and the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the evidence
offered was very limited. ''It is not nearly enough to do something
with,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Donald Mancuso, the deputy inspector general, is
required by law to determine whether a formal investigation may be
merited, the official said. Mancuso is handling the matter because
the inspector general post is vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the retired officer who made the allegation against
Kennedy was not disclosed but is known to Mancuso, officials said.
The accusing officer said the misconduct happened in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Mancuso is doing at this point is trying to ascertain
additional information in order to make a decision as to the way
ahead,'' the senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   The new allegation against Kennedy was first reported Saturday
by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials declined to comment on the development. The Army
has not even confirmed for the record that Kennedy filed a
complaint or that the Army inspector general is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kennedy nor the officer she accused of sexually
harassing her in 1996, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, has responded to
media requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 52, who is not married, lodged her complaint after the
Army announced in August that Smith, who is married, was chosen to
be the Army's deputy inspector general. In that post, he would be
responsible for investigating misconduct including behavior such as
that of which he stands accused.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith was announced as the next deputy inspector
general of the Army on Aug. 27, he never assumed the position. His
status has been on official ''hold'' since last November, according
to Army personnel records. He has been working at Army Materiel
Command in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a career armor officer and a decorated veteran of the
Vietnam War, commanded the Army Security Assistance Command at the
time of last August's announcement. Before that he managed the
Army's modernization program for the national guard of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence,
the service's most senior female general. She is among only three
female three-star generals in the military. She is due to retire in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy case is the latest in a string of embarrassing
sexual misconduct cases in the Army. An earlier case involved
another two-star general from the inspector general's office.

<HEADLINE> GOP Blames Clinton for Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The reason prices are so high at the gasoline
pump is the Clinton administration has let OPEC monopolize U.S. oil
supplies while failing to allow further exploration of possible
domestic energy sources, a Senate Republican alleged Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP's weekly radio address, Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, denounced President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
for focusing on renewable energy concepts like solar, wind and
geothermal sources. Instead, he said, they should have opened U.S.
lands for oil and gas exploration and expanded the hydroelectric
dams system and used more coal-fired or nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''So how do Clinton and Gore propose that we generate energy to
run our industry and farms, heat our homes and fuel our trucks,
cars and airplanes?'' asked Murkowski, chairman of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ''Hot air from Washington
won't do the job!''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said Americans are ''being held hostage'' by the
Clinton administration's reliance on imported oil from the Middle
East. He noted that the percentage of imported oil has increased
from 43 percent in 1993 to 56 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the administration's energy department warned that if we
do nothing, imports could rise to 65 percent in 15 years. So what
did the Clinton-Gore team do to reduce our reliance on imported
oil? In a word, nothing,'' Murkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton criticized Congress last week for failing to
protect the nation's energy security by not renewing his authority
to tap government oil reserves. The Senate approved a four-year
extension of his authority to draw from the reserve, but the
authority expired when the House failed to act.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also has said that its diplomatic
efforts resulted in the recent agreement by the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production by 1.7 million
barrels a day, which is expected to result in lower prices this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a revised Energy Department forecast said gasoline
prices should peak this month and decline to an average of $1.46 a
gallon for the summer. The forecast ameliorated the prospect of $2
per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, but it still has
motorists paying about 25 percent more for gasoline this summer
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said failure of U.S. energy policy is illustrated by
the import of 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq, despite the
Persian Gulf War and current U.S. military efforts to contain Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're bombing the guy who is refueling our warplanes,'' he
said. ''What kind of an energy policy is that?''

<HEADLINE> Jagger Unhealthy at Health Panel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Bianca Jagger wasn't a picture of health
for her appearance as guest speaker at a conference on women's
health.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-wife of Rolling Stones rocker Mick Jagger arrived bundled
up, with her neck wrapped in a bright orange scarf.
</P>
<P>
   She told the crowd Thursday at the Hartford Artists Collective
she had walking pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she lent her voice to a subject she's been promoting for
years -- global human rights. Jagger, who will turn 55 next month,
delivered the keynote address on Women and Children in the Third
World at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't save all the children,'' she said. ''But if you can
save one, God bless.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Mick Jagger divorced in 1979. They have a daughter,
Jade, 26, and two grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Seaman Accused in Gov't Memo Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A civilian Defense Department employee who worked
aboard an ammunition supply ship has been charged with theft of
sensitive government documents.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Steven Smith, 37, was arrested without incident Friday
in San Diego by FBI and Naval Criminal Investigative Service
agents. He remained jailed Saturday pending a court appearance next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was assigned as a seaman aboard the USNS Kilauea, part of
the Military Sealift Command, an FBI news release said. The command
is based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times quoted an unidentified Justice Department
source as saying the complaint alleged Smith possessed information
about unspecified ammunition aboard the ship and was considering
putting the information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent John Iannarelli said the theft occurred April
1, when the ship was moored at Naval Station Bremerton on the Puget
Sound. The charges were filed in a federal court in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is charged with obtaining documents respecting national
security, the FBI said. He is also charged with theft of government
property including documents and computer disks.

<HEADLINE> Italian da Vinci Exhibit Opens  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS REDMONT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASSISI, Italy (AP) -- An exhibition commemorating the
revolutionary work of Leonardo da Vinci, the Renaissance visionary
who predicted global communication 500 years ago, opened Saturday
in this central Italian city.
</P>
<P>
   Assisted by the University of California's Hammer Center for
Leonardo Studies and money from private lenders in the United
States and Italy, the exhibit explores Leonardo's inventions, art
and influence on the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   It includes models based on his designs for a hang glider,
propeller-driven roasting spits, ball-bearing baby strollers and
forerunners of today's home appliances, such as the pressure cooker
and the steam iron.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Leonardo's drawings from the private collection of
Barbara Johnson of Princeton, N.J., are also on view, along with
paintings by Goya, Salvador Dali and other artists inspired by da
Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   According to Alessandro Vezzosi, curator of the
government-sponsored exhibit, the inspiration for it came from a
line in Leonardo's manuscript ''Atlantic Codex.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Men will talk and touch and embrace while being in one and the
other hemisphere, and will understand each other's language.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo stopped in Assisi in 1503 on his way to Rome from
Perugia and is thought to have met there with his friend, the
political philosopher Nicolo Machiavelli.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit will travel to other Italian cities and possibly
abroad later this year. It will be enriched by da Vinci-inspired
works by artists who -- in keeping with the tone of the exhibition --
have been asked to make their submissions by fax or e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Underwood Says Blacks Shortchanged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Blair Underwood says the furor over the lack
of minority faces on TV and in films hasn't changed the big picture
much.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and other minorities still are shortchanged by the big
networks and on the big screen, says the black actor, who plays Dr.
Ben Turner on the CBS show ''City of Angels'' and has a role in the
new film ''Rules of Engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack is on the major networks,'' he told the Los Angeles
Times. ''You are saying, UPN, the WB and the cables -- you'll handle
the black audience, and the networks that have the most money,
access and channels will exclude all the people of color. Therein
lies the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On film, minorities have more representation in independent
productions than in big studio productions ''unless you're a big
name like Sam Jackson or Denzel (Washington),'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Marine Capt. Found Guilty in Death  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain charged in the
heatstroke death of a reservist was found guilty Saturday of
dereliction of duty and failure to obey an order.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ralph Kohlman, the military judge hearing the case,
said Capt. Victor Arana was guilty of both charges, but removed
language in one charge that contended Arana failed to stay with his
unit after a grueling July 7 hike that led to Lance Cpl. Giuseppe
''Joey'' Leto's death.
</P>
<P>
   Arana showed no emotion as the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a maximum sentence of nine months in prison and
dismissal from the Marines. Following the verdict Saturday, the
sentencing phase of the court-martial began and was scheduled to
resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Leto's cousin, Annamaria Des Biens, testified during sentencing,
describing Leto's dedication to the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he joined the Marines, that was when he felt his life was
fully satisfied,'' she said, crying. ''He was the few, the proud.
He was the epitome of the Marines.''
</P>
<P>
   Leto's mother, Domenica Leto, said her son's death convinced the
family that Leto's younger brother Vincent would not join the
Marines as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Marine Corps lost two soldiers, not one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had argued in closing arguments Saturday morning
that Arana, 28, of Chicago, had violated standard operating
procedures for conditioning hikes and that he showed a careless
disregard for his men.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was like a horse with blinders on,'' Maj. Chris Hamilton
told the judge. ''He was head down, focused forward. There was
absolutely no supervision of that conditioning hike.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana's defense attorneys argued that Arana was a rookie company
commander in charge of the unit for only 16 days when he led the
180 Marines, all carrying weapons and packs, on the eight-mile
night march in 80-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stevens said Arana did not receive proper instructions from
his superiors and delegated authority to his non-commissioned
officers as allowed in standard operating procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that there were some judgment and leadership
errors made on this hike,'' Stevens said. ''All judgment errors and
leadership errors do not equate to criminal liability. Good
judgment comes from experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana testified Thursday that he didn't realize there were so
many stragglers until the hike was more than half completed and
that he considered calling in trucks to take the Marines the rest
of the way, but instead decided to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said Arana could not blame his subordinates for his own
failing to supervise the troops. ''He chose to ignore the signs of
an unsafe march at every step of the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused broke the backs and the will of the company in the
first leg of that hike,'' Hamilton said. ''The accused wasn't
looking over his shoulder, the only thing the accused was looking
at, your honor, was his watch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the hike, Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn.,
wandered more than half a mile from the area, and Arana failed to
obtain a proper head count or weapons count, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after the hike, following a head count that prompted a
search for him, Leto was found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this negligent conduct does not meet the standard of
due care that is expected of a company commander to ensure the
safety and welfare of his marines,'' Hamilton told the judge.
