<HEADLINE> Singapore Minister on Fight Against Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Minister for Home
Affairs Wong Kan Seng declared the National Anti-Drug Abuse
Campaign '96 open here today and said Singapore is on the right
path, but the fight against drug abuse is far from over.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not hesitate to introduce deterrent
measures and stiffer penalties, citing the example of the ecstasy
drug, which is fast making its way into night-spots in this tiny
island republic.
</P>
<P>
"The ecstasy pills phenomenon illustrates the fluid nature of
the drug situation and the reason why we must never let our guard
down," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the combined efforts of the government and community
groups, he said, the number of new addicts in 1995 had decreased,
the upward trend in the proportion of Malay addicts in the Drug
Rehabilitation Centers had halted, and the number of first-timer
Malay addicts as well as local new addicts had fallen.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the right path but the fight against drug abuse is
far from over," he stressed, pointing out that new drugs and new
trends and development could suddenly appear and become a problem
overnight.
</P>
<P>
This year's campaign aims at getting through the important
message that drug abuse can cause permanent damage to a person's
brain and body, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the responsibility of preventing drug
addictions and protecting the youths from drugs does not rest
solely on the government and community groups. Parents have a big
role to play in this important duty to protect the youths, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EC Tables Proposals to Strengthen EU-India Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today adopted a document aimed at strengthening relations between
the European Union (EU) and India.
</P>
<P>
Although India accounts for a relatively small portion of
international trade, it has huge potential for investment, and
Europe should grasp the opportunity, the EC said in the document,
which will be presented to the European Council and the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The document, which listed a number of areas in which the EU
and India could cooperate, said that the priority should be to
eliminate obstacles to trade.
</P>
<P>
The EU is India's largest trading partner, taking 26 percent of
Indian exports and accounting for 30 percent of India's imports.
</P>
<P>
However, India accounts for only 1.3 percent of the EU's
external trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Europe invested some 1.3 billion ECU (1.7 billion
dollars) in India, accounting for 18.4 percent of the country's
foreign investment, behind the United States' 22.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the EU and India are currently governed by a
Partnership Cooperation Agreement signed in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Birth Rate Lowered By Abortions, Miscarriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- As many as 120,000 Bulgarian women
had abortions or miscarriages between January and May, up almost
one-fifth over the whole of last year and leaving the population
growth rate under 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, during the first five months of this year, a total of
60,000 babies were born, compared with 79,000 babies in the whole
of 1995, the Trud newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in abortions has been attributed to the soaring
cost of living and increasing numbers of pregnancies among
unmarried women.
</P>
<P>
The cost of having an abortion in Bulgaria is also surging,
said the report.

<HEADLINE> Study:U.S. Economy Can Go Up Without Runaway Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic development
can be put at a much quicker pace without runaway of inflation, a
major manufacturing trade group said today.
</P>
<P>
The view is included in a study released by the National
Association of Manufacturers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Non-inflationary, higher growth is possible due to
technological advances and structurally lower inflation possible
due to increased international competition and domestic
deregulation, said Jasinowski, president of the manufacturers
group and author of the study.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth can be boosted from the current 2.2 percent
to 3 percent by the year 2000 without rising of inflation, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
The study named "The Case for Higher Growth" notes many
economists including those at the Federal Reserve and on Wall
Street generally believe the economy can grow no more than 2.3
percent annually without overheating.
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski said the conventional view that the higher growth
will result in higher inflation is wrong. "This view does not take
into account changes that are creating a new economy," he said.
"As a result of technological advances and greater capital
investment, the growth rate could rise to 2.8 percent."
</P>
<P>
He urged the nation to set an interim goal of 3 percent growth
by the year 2000 and to "explore the types of long-term structural
changes that can eventually achieve a growth rate approaching 3.5
percent."
</P>
<P>
Jasinowski said economic growth has averaged 3.2 percent since
the 1870s and exceeded 5 percent annually in the 1960s. By
comparison, growth has averaged only 2.2 percent a year in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
To reach 3 percent, he contends, monetary policy must be
loosened to permit lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Several policy changes also will be needed, including a
balanced budget, a smaller trade deficit, tax policy revisions to
increase both investment and worker productivity and government
regulatory reforms to reduce the costs of business.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Mogadishu Spreads to City center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The forces of the two main
warlords in Mogadishu General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi
Mohamed engaged in bitter fighting today at the Green Line
dividing the war-torn capital.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people have been killed and as many as 14
others wounded in the fighting at the heart of the city today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is said to have started when militiamen loyal to
Ali Mahdi Mohamed were deployed along the Green Line last night
in an effort to weaken the militia strength of Aidid against Ali
Mahdi's ally Osman Hassan Ali Atto in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been fleeing their houses with a
little belongings in the districts of Bondhere, Wardhighley and
Shingani to the relatively safe areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
Some told reporters that they had left their houses which they
refurbished along the Green Line just after the end of the
disastrous fighting between these two warlords in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The clashes at the Green Line followed when the militiamen of
Aidid retook control of the strategic point of K-7 from the hands
of Atto's militiamen last night.
</P>
<P>
The junction which links Mogadishu to the southern regions of
Somalia fell to Atto two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which ensued between forces of Atto and Aidid
over the control of the junction has claimed the lives of more
than 13 people while the wounded exceeded 19 in heavy fighting
last night.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi, the North Mogadishu faction leader, seems to be
fully and practically supporting Atto and his Abgal clansmen
living in Medina district of South Mogadishu neighboring Bosnia
vicinity where Atto found his base.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Ali Mahdi in this new round of fighting may
turn the motive of the armed challenges in Mogadishu into a clan
war between the Habar Gidir clan of General Aidid and Abgal clan
of Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
This is also likely to unite the militiamen of Osman Atto and
General Aidid, thus further complicating any lasting solution to
Somalia's multi-politicized crisis.
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures included more than 50 fatalities and nearly a
hundred others wounded and they were mainly civilians hit by
stray rounds of mortars and heavy machine gun bullets since the
fighting broke out in South Mogadishu last Saturday.

<HEADLINE> 0626121f Striking Swazi Teachers to Discuss Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Teachers and civil servants
in Swaziland are meeting today to discuss what action to take
after the country's Industrial Court ordered them to end their
strike action.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Mbabane said the 10,000-strong Swaziland National
Association of Teachers (SNAT) has called a mass meeting to be
held tomorrow in Manzini.
</P>
<P>
SNAT Secretary-General Saladin Magagula said today the
association's next course of action would be decided at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Association of Civil Servants (ACS) of
Swaziland will also be meeting in Manzini to discuss the court
order.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Court claims both organizations have violated
their collective agreements with the Swazi government.
</P>
<P>
The teachers and civil servants went on a 10-day strike to
demand a 18 percent salary increase. The Swazi government is
offering them 9.9 percent plus a four percent increase in
allowances.
</P>
<P>
After the court's finding, Swazi Education Minister Solomon
Dlamini on Monday night announced schools would reopen.
</P>
<P>
Most schools in and around Mbabane were yesterday functioning
normally but teachers at some schools in the capital and Manzini
sent pupils home.
</P>
<P>
The strike decision taken by the ACS executive received poor
support and had little impact on the civil service.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government today
accepted the major demands of the business community for the next
fiscal budget, said President of Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Ilyas Bilour.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on the conclusion of a
three-day intensive talks between the government and the FPCCI,
Bilour said that most of their demands would be later incorporated
in the money bill.
</P>
<P>
Expressing gratitude to the government, he said the talks were
held in a congenial and affable atmosphere and cooperation between
the government and the business community would continue in
future.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after the meeting, Asif Ali Zardari, head of
the government negotiating team, said that the talks were held in
a very amiable and cordial manner and there was a spirit of
cooperation with each other on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The business community cooperated with us and we will
continue to work together."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government this month announced the budget for
the fiscal year of July 1996 to June 1997, imposing the heaviest
tax in the country's history, which drew protest from the business
community.
</P>
<P>
The opposition called a countrywide strike against the budget
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the FPCCI decided not to participate in the strike and
accepted the government's invitation for talks on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The main demands of the FPCCI presented to the government
included exemption of one house and one ship from wealth tax,
continuation of fixed sales tax scheme on 28 industries, reduction
in the rate of general sales tax and other issues concerning sales
tax and income tax and removal of anomalies in customs and
exercise duty.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has one of the most
successful community controlled wildlife programs in Africa, a
prominent conservationist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Pan-African Symposium on Natural Resources
Management, the Southern African Sustainable Use Specialist Group
Chairman Rowan Martin said wildlife management under the communal
areas management program for indigenous resources (CAMPFIRE) is
playing its rightful role in land use and the economy of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"This is a grassroots movement which empowers rural people to
undertake their own wildlife management and to receive direct
benefits from it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Martin told the 100 delegates from 20 African countries that
more than five percent of Zimbabwe's 10.5 million people are now
involved in CAMPFIRE.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, had a strong commitment to enhance rural
prosperity and considered that both the conservation and the use
of its natural resources could be harmonized to achieve
sustainable development for all its people.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe's policy is to encourage the sustainable use of
wildlife and its habitat, recognizing that this is only likely if
wildlife can be used profitably, the primary benefits accruing to
people with wildlife on their land," said Martin.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from English- and French-speaking Africa are
exchanging experience on natural resource management in the
symposium which started on Monday and will end on Thursday.

LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain today seriously condemned a
bomb attack Tuesday night on a military complex in Saudi Arabia,
extending its sympathies to the families of the victims and
offering its assistance to help bring those responsible to
justice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC television, Prime Minister John Major
condemned the attack as "appalling act, an act of pure evil".
</P>
<P>
"A large number of innocent people were just brutally murdered.
I very much hope that we very soon find out who did it so they can
be punished," Major said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said in a statement that "the
British government condemns in the strongest possible terms the
appalling terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia last night."
</P>
<P>
"We extend our sympathies to the families of the victims. We
will give maximum assistance to Saudi Arabia in its efforts to
identify the perpetrators," Rifkind added.
</P>
<P>
At least 23 Americans have been reportedly killed and over 300
wounded in a bomb attack on an air base Tuesday night in the Saudi
city of Khobar.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 British Royal Air Force personnel are stationed in
Khobar as part of a multinational operation to enforce a no-fly
zone imposed by the United Nations over southern Iraq.
</P>

But Rifkind said that he was not aware of any British
casualties.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Puts Down Forest Fires, Faces Threat of Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has extinguished all
the fires that raged across its forests and grasslands for nearly
four months, Nature and Environment Minister Zambyn Batjargal said
today.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that the country should prepare for another
natural disaster -- flooding -- as weather forecasts predict heavy
rain in much of the country within weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Batjargal said 386 fires had hit the
country since this spring, destroying 2.4 million hectares of
forests and 7.8 million hectares of grassland.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates show that losses caused by the fires
reached a staggering 1,591 billion tugriks (3.4 billion
U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Batjargal also expressed thanks to the international community
for helping Mongolia in its fight against the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Batjargal said Mongolia will draw lessons from the prolonged
fires by cracking down on arsonists and setting up a mechanism for
fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Mongolia will plant 5,000 to 6,000 hectares
of trees each year to restore the ecology of areas damaged by the
fires.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
nominated a woman career diplomat named Arlene Rebder as new
ambassador to Zambia to replace Roland Kuchel.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Render, currently in charge of Central
African affairs, will become effective after the U.S. Senate
confirms her nomination, a news release from the American center
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Render said if she is confirmed she will work energetically to
advance the United States interests in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Render who has 26 years of foreign affairs said she will use
the experience to encourage Zambia in its transition period to
the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Render said that the recent actions by the Zambian
government threaten to damage the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
After Zambian President Frederick Chiluba signed a
constitution amendment bill into law at the end of last month the
U.S. administration threatened to withhold its aid to Zambia
unless the later backs down on the bill, which bars former
president Kenneth Kaunda from standing in the general elections
because Kaunda's parents were Malawian immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Three Israeli Soldiers Killed in Jordanian Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
killed and two others wounded today in an ambush by terrorists
near the Israeli-Jordanian border in Jordanian Valley, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The ambush took place early this morning near the Na'aran
settlements several kilometers north of the West Bank city of
Jericho, when an Israeli border patrol came under sudden attacks
by three to five armed terrorists, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, believed to have crossed the Jordanian River
from Jordan, exchanged fires with the Israeli soldiers for a
short while before fleeing back to Jordan with several guns
snatched from the dead soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The two wounded soldiers were evacuated by an Israeli
helicopter to Jerusalem's Hadasha Hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army contacted the Jordanian border troops and
conducted joint search for the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the
attack. However, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai blamed
the Jordanian army for failing to prevent the infiltration,
although acknowledging they have been trying the best to do so.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to
the families of the victims, promising them that Israel will
upgrade cooperation with Jordan in cracking down the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein telephoned Netanyahu to express his
regret about this attack, pledging Jordan will boost its
efforts to check the armed infiltration to prevent future
attacks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Releases Tourism White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African tourism
industry has the potential for significant growth on job
creation, said the tourism white paper released in Pretoria
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the release of the white paper, the
Environmental Affairs and Tourism Department said tourism, which
at present contributes four percent to the gross domestic product
(GDP), has the potential to increase to eight percent of the GDP
by 2000 and to 10 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
In monetary terms, this will represent an increase in foreign
exchange earnings from the present 10 billion Rand (about 2.32
billion US Dollars) to 9.3 billion US Dollars, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one million or more jobs can be created
directly and indirectly should such growth be achieved.
</P>
<P>
However, constraints on growth mentioned in the white paper
include inadequate resourcing and funding of the industry,
inadequate training of locals to improve service levels and
supply the industry's labor needs, absence of sound environmental
management and lack of infrastructure, particularly in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the white paper's departure point is
the sustainable development of tourism as a national priority in
a way which will significantly improve the quality of life of all
South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the white paper proposed some specific guidelines
for implementation, such as a special tourism safety and security
program, improved access to funding through government channels
and aggressive local and international marketing program.

<HEADLINE> Striking Swazi Teachers to Discuss Court Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Teachers and civil servants
in Swaziland are meeting today to discuss what action to take
after the country's Industrial Court ordered them to end their
strike action.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Mbabane said the 10,000-strong Swaziland National
Association of Teachers (SNAT) has called a mass meeting to be
held tomorrow in Manzini.
</P>
<P>
SNAT Secretary-General Saladin Magagula said today the
association's next course of action would be decided at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Association of Civil Servants (ACS) of
Swaziland will also be meeting in Manzini to discuss the court
order.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Court claims both organizations have violated
their collective agreements with the Swazi government.
</P>
<P>
The teachers and civil servants went on a 10-day strike to
demand an 18 percent salary increase. The Swazi government is
offering them 9.9 percent plus a four percent increase in
allowances.
</P>
<P>
After the court's finding, Swazi Education Minister Solomon
Dlamini on Monday night announced schools would reopen.
</P>
<P>
Most schools in and around Mbabane were yesterday functioning
normally but teachers at some schools in the capital and Manzini
sent pupils home.
</P>
<P>
The strike decision taken by the ACS executive received poor
support and had little impact on the civil service.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Sino-U.S. relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that maintaining healthy and stable
relations between China and the U.S. has great significance on
peace, stability and prosperity in the Asian-Pacific region and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais (The
Country) this morning, Jiang said this is because China and the
U.S. are big countries and permenent members of the UN Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on a four-day state visit to Spain at the invitation
of King Juan Carlos I.
</P>
<P>
"I proposed, as early as in 1992, that China and the U.S.
should increase trust, reduce troubles, develop cooperation and
avert confrontation," Jiang said during the interview.
</P>
<P>
"This remains to be our basic policy in handling Sino-U.S.
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to healthy and stable Sino-U.S. relations is adherence
to the principles enthroned in the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques, especially the principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, the proper handling of the Taiwan issue,
and the proper handling of every single problem in bilateral
relations in the spirit of mutual respect and consultation on
equal footing, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he has taken notice of some positive signals with
regard to Sino-U.S. relations made by U.S. leaders recently.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as long as both sides give priority to the
fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples,
treat and tackle bilateral relations from a strategic height and
long-term perspective, China and the U.S. can overcome differences
and frictions and put bilateral relations on track of normal and
healthy development," Jiang emphasized.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Makes Contacts on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary-General's
special envoy for Cyprus, Han Sung-Joo, started making contacts
with leaders of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities on the island to get himself acquainted with the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Han, who arrived in Cyprus Tuesday, had an hour-long meeting
with President Glafcos Clerides soon after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Han said he had "a very good and
constructive discussion" with President Clerides, whom he met for
the second time.
</P>
<P>
The two men first met in Geneva on June 11, but he said this
time they had "a much more in-depth discussion of the issues and
possibilities."
</P>
<P>
Han also said he will try two approaches for solving the
Cyprus problem, that is, he will work for "incremental
improvement" and "quantum jump."
</P>
<P>
Today, he met with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the
Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia, only divided capital
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Denktash is reported to have asked the U.N. envoy to talk
President Clerides into accepting a dialogue to establish if
there is common ground to start talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.N. envoy's contacts on the island,
government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today that "I
believe the purpose of his visit here is to seek more views on how
to approach the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said Han indicated that he intends to visit
European capitals and Washington in an effort to coordinate
efforts to make headway in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy, who is on a six-day visit to the island, is
scheduled to see President Clerides again Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> S.African Banks Lower Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Three major South African
banks today announced a one percent drop in their prime lending
rates and two of them said they would reduce their home loan
rates from July 1.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued in Johannesburg, First National
Bank and Nedcor, representing Nedbank and Permanent Bank, said
they would reduce home loan rates to 19.25 percent and prime
lending rates to 19.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
And, Standard Bank said it would reduce its prime lending rate
to 19.50 percent from July 1, while an announcement on home loan
rates would be made on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The announcements followed the decision by the Amalgamated
Banks of South Africa (ABSA) on Tuesday to reduce its prime
lending rate and home loan rate by one percentage point from July
1.
</P>
<P>
ABSA consists of United Bank, Trust Bank, Volkskas and Allied
Bank.
</P>
<P>
ABSA said the reduction had been made possible by the easing
''and an expectation of further softening'' of money market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals announced on Tuesday he was
prepared to ''lend some marginal support'' to the downward trend
in short-term money market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the Reserve Bank would also reduce the interest
rate for second-tier loans at the ''discount window'' from 1.5 to
0.75 percent from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nedcor Chief Executive Richard Laubscher said on Wednesday
Stals's reduction of the ''penalty rate'' was an additional
factor in making their decision.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the major banks to lower their prime lending
and home loan rates was welcomed by the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, saying this was a victory for all South Africans.

<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali discussed his second term bid with British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today immediately after his talk with
British Prime minister John Major last night.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Ghali's second term bid, their talks focused on a
range of U.N affairs, such as U.N reform and U.N finances. They
also discussed what happens in Bosnia after the departure of U.N
peace-keeping forces, as well as Burundi, Nigeria and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The British Government did not issued any formal statement on
the talks. However, an official from Foreign Office gave this
reporter a brief account of their talks in a telephon-interview.
</P>
<P>
The official praised Ghali as a "distinguished statesman" who
had served U.N with honour in one of the world's most difficult
assignments.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Britain's attitude towards Ghali's second
term bid, the official said "Britain does not comment publicly on
the election of the Secretary-General. As for Mr Ghali, there are
still 6 months to run and a full agenda ahead."
</P>
<P>
He also said: "Before consultations with its allies, Britain
will not make decision on the U.N post."
</P>
<P>
diplomats here said leaders from the seven industrial nations
will consult privately on Ghali's bid in the coming summit in
Lyon, France.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang on China's Peaceful Unification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with the Spanish newspaper "El Pais (The Country),"
Jiang said: "I had declared that we welcome leaders of the Taiwan
authorities to visit the mainland in proper capacities and we are also
willing to accept the invitation of the Taiwan side and go to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"This principled stand of ours remain unchanged," said Jiang,
who arrived here Monday on a four-day state visit to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President added that only so can the meeting between
leaders from both sides of the Taiwan strait bear substantive
meanings.
</P>
<P>
He said that opening negotiations for peaceful unification is
"our long-held position," adding that he proposed such negotiations
on behalf of the the Chinese Communist Party and the central
government on January 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I proposed that as the first step, the two sides can hold
negotiations on officially ending hostilities under the principle of
one China and reach an agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
On this basis, he said, both sides commit themselves to defending
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and making plans for
the development of their relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory, and it is an entirely domestic affair of China to settle
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have insisted on solving the Taiwan issue in light of the
basic policy of peaceful unification and one country, two systems,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We don't commit ourselves to renouncing the use of force, which
is not directed against the Taiwan people, but against foreign
interventions and separatist attempts on the Taiwan island," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait and see what the attitude of the Taiwan
authorities actually is," he added.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Population Set for 21 Million Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's population is
expected to increase from the present 44.7 million to 65.7
million by the year 2020, according to a report released here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report, conducted by the Development Bank of Southern Africa,
was based on the results of official population censuses, other
secondary sources, and its own estimates based on statistical and
demographic techniques.
</P>
<P>
The expected increase would have a significant impact on the
delivery of public services and imfrastructure in urban
areas, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the population of Gauteng Province, South
Africa's economic powerhouse, is expected to double from the present
7.4 million to 14.7 million by 2020, increasing the province's
population density from 394 to 783 people per square metre.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, South Africa's population was 61.8 percent urbanised but
up to 82.4 percent could be expected to live in towns and cities by
2020.
</P>
<P>
''The implications of a national population increase of about 21
million over the next 25 years, coupled with increased population
density, are vast, particularly with regard to poverty, unemployment,
housing and the utilisation of natural resources,'' said the
statement. enditem

<HEADLINE> 76 Foreign Companies Prospects for Gold in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-six foreign companies,
mostly from Canada, Britain, the United States, and South Africa,
are actively prospecting for gold in Ghana, Ghanaian President
Jerry Rawlings said today.
</P>
<P>
''Our annual production is over the one million ounces mark,''
said the president, quoted by a report reaching here today, in
addressing the International Conference on Reviving Private
Investment in Africa which is currently held in the Ghanaian
capital of Accra.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said the Ashanti Goldfields Company, the largest in
Africa and the pride of Ghana, is itsself close to achieve the
one million ounce mark.
</P>
<P>
Ashanti has been able to attract large amounts of private capital
for its expansion activities in Ghana and other parts of Africa
because the company is listed in many stock exchanges around the
world.
</P>
<P>
''Such access to international capital markets is important for
the success of the private sector in Africa,'' said Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
The president also stated that efforts should be made to improve
energy supply in both west and southern Africa with the participation
of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised the need to involve the private sector in the
implementation of projects such as the Nigeria gas supply to Benin,
Togo, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian president urged the African Development Bank,
and other regional and international financial institutions to be
actively involved in increasing private investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, which opened on Monday in Accra, is
being attended by over 1,000 participants from Africa, Europe, Asia
and the U.S..

<P>
ATHENS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
threatened today to resign unless he is elected the new leader of
the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).
</P>
<P>
Simitis was addressing the party's fourth congress which opened
here a day after party leader and former prime minister Andreas
Papandreou was buried.
</P>
<P>
''Following the death of Andreas Papandreou, I am submitting my
candidacy for the post of party president,'' Simitis told the
congress attended by some 5,000 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that if he was not elected, he would be compelled
to resign from the premiership.
</P>
<P>
He said his resignation would be necessary because "the prime
minister and the president of PASOK must be one and the same
person in order for the government to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
Simitis, who took over from the then-hospitalized Papandreou as
premier in January, faces stiff opposition from Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, a Papandreou confidant, who is certain to fight
for the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
The four-day congress is expected to elect a new leader on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Mediterranean Women Conference Opens in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Around 100 women from the
Mediterranean, the Balkans and the Middle East are attending the
fifth annual conference of the Association of Women of the
Mediterranean Region (AWMR), which opened Wednesday night in
Cyprus' southern coastal town Limassol.
</P>
<P>
AWMR President Jana Mintoff Bland said today that the main
themes of the conference are the issues of immigration and
refugees.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the conference is held in
Cyprus. Women from all walks of life and political circles are
taking part in the conference, which will end on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mintoff Bland noted that 80 percent of refugees is women and
children, adding that the conference "is concerned of their
increasing number".
</P>

Women from Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas,
and the territories that used to form former Yugoslavia will put

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Urges Action Against Financial Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said that corrupt people must be removed from the financial sector
and that financial crimes must be treated seriously.
</P>
<P>
"Financial criminal activities must be dealt with harshly so as
to guarantee the smooth working of our financial reforms and the
development of the finance industry," Zhu told a national meeting
on Wednesday, which was organized by the State Council and
attended by leading officials of banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The financial community has made a great contribution to the
rapid and healthy development of the national economy over the
past several years, Zhu said, and it has also done well in
fighting corruption and in building clean and honest government.
</P>
<P>
Major economic crimes, fraud, robbery, and theft in the
financial sector have declined steadily over several years, Zhu
pointed out, noting that improved supervision has not only helped
maintain financial order but has improved economic order overall.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, financial crimes are a complex and
international social phenomenon and criminals will always target
banks.
</P>
<P>
"Fighting financial crimes is a long-term task and we must not
become slack now just because we have scored some success," Zhu
warned.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a serious amount of red-tape still exists in the
financial sector and the work against robbery, fraud and theft is
still not enough for public security.
</P>
<P>
There have been robberies of armored cars and of banking
businesses and bank employees have been killed, Zhu reminded those
attending.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, he said, an effort must be made to
increase the struggle against corruption and financial crimes and
to rid the financial sector of embezzlers and corrupt people.
</P>
<P>
Financial security must also be improved and the installation
of electronic monitoring and alarm systems should be accelerated,
Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Forecasts More Ocean Disasters This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China will have more and severe
oceanic natural disasters in 1996, with Zhejiang and Fujian
Provinces in east China more likely to take more of a lashing than
southern Guangdong Province, according to a press conference held
today by the National Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
Four or five tidal storms caused by typhoons will hit coastal
areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and southern China between now and
October. Several tidal storms are also predicted in the Bohai and
Laizhou bays.
</P>
<P>
The number of days with destructive waves, above four meters
high, will be more than last year's 278 days, and more will be
caused by tropical cyclones. Huge waves are quite likely to affect
parts of the Taiwan Straits and the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Eight or nine red tides will hit China's seashores this year,
almost the same number as last year. Most of them will occur on
seriously-contaminated seashores or in marine breeding areas.
</P>
<P>
But there will be no "el nino" phenomenon this year, which
refers to rapid rises of temperature in tropical areas of the
eastern pacific ocean, and tends to be followed by severe floods
or droughts in the following year in Asia and America.
</P>
<P>
There will be less sea ice in the Bouhai and northern Huanghai
seas from November 1996 to March 1997 than in the same period of
in the previous corresponding period, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center has
intensified its monitoring efforts by reinforcing its work staff;
putting into operation various forecasting methods; checking its
facilities; and strengthening the consultation system," said Yu
Zhouwen, director of the National Marine Environmental Forecasting
Center.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid economic development of China's coastal areas
and the increasing density of population and assets, the annual
economic losses caused by the oceanic disasters have also risen
sharply, from about one billion yuan(114 million US dollars) in
early 1980s to about ten billion yuan(1.14 billion US dollars) in
1995.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Fishing Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China will impose a fishing ban in
China's Yellow Sea and East China Sea from July 1 to August 31,
said an official with the Ministry of Agriculture today.
</P>
<P>
It follows the success of a similar ban in the area last year.
</P>
<P>
"No boat will be permitted to fish in July and August, and in
the following two months some limits will be exerted on fishing,"
said the official from the Department of Fishery under the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, boats can only fish in areas 30 sea
miles east of the fisheries-restriction line and a strict check
system of young fish proportions will be applied during the
September-October period.
</P>
<P>
Offshore fishing will be banned in the northern part of the
East China Sea and the southern part of Yellow Sea, covering
Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Calling the "fishing ban" an effective way to protect China's
fish resources, especially the hairtail, the official said that
last year's fishing ban was a great success.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country, for the first time, banned fishing in
July and August in its offshore fishing waters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the autumn high water season in 1995,
the hairtail output increased by 14 percent over 1994, hitting a
record high.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the short-term fishing ban helped fishery companies
and fishermen reduce their costs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that there are still some problems
existing from last year's ban.
</P>
<P>
He noted that last year, though the country worked out limiting
regulations on fishery in September and October, the poor
administration impaired the whole process.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of fishery boats crowded within the fishery-banning
areas fishing young hairtail, offsetting the achievements gained
in the previous two months," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry this year will pay more attention to
the fishery management in the September-October period, while
sparing no efforts to do a good job in the July-August fishing
ban.

<HEADLINE> China to Have 120,000 Data Communication Network Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China will have 120,000 data
communication network users by the end of 1996, sources of the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Yunjie, director of the Data Communication
Bureau under the MPT, China's data communication industry has
entered a stage of rapid development. China had only about 1,700
data communication users at the end of 1993, and the number has
climbed to about 100,000.
</P>
<P>
China adheres to the principle of seeking high starting points,
high levels and unconventional modes of development in the
construction of public data communication networks, Liu said, and
it has established a network system which provides a variety of
services and strong support for various information application
systems.
</P>
<P>
China has opened CHINAPAC, CHINADDN and CHINANET since 1993,
which have become the core of the country's information network.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the networks had 31 major subscribers, and
many have built separate application systems by taking advantage
of the public data networks. They include institutions and
government departments, including national banks, the State
Commission of Economy and Trade, the State Administration of
Taxation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the State Education
Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, China Travel Services, securities exchanges, futures
trade departments, public security departments, universities and
railway departments.
</P>
<P>
CHINAPAC currently covers more than 2,000 cities and has
100,000 ports. It is expected to reach more than 3,600 cities and
have 140,000 ports by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
CHINADDN listed users in more than 1,000 cities above the
county level at the end of 1995. It is expected to cover over
3,000 cities above the county level and have 140,000 ports by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
CHINANET now has subscribers in over 200 cities across the
country, and local networks are under construction.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate the number of public data network users in
China will reach one million by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> EC Aids Restructuring of Austria's Textile Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
today that it will provide Austria with 2.6 million ECU (3.44
million U.S. dollars) to modernize the country's textile and
garment industry.
</P>
<P>
The money, from the European Union's Structure Funds, will also
be used to help diversify the economy of predominantly
textile-producing regions such as Lower Austria, Styria and
Vorarlberg.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will go toward the introduction of new
manufacturing technologies and new products, their proper
marketing, the promotion of cooperation schemes between firms and
vocational training measures.
</P>
<P>
The EC's total investment in the program is 16.2 million ECU
(21.06 million dollars), which will be matched by 2.6 million ECU
(3.44 million dollars) from Austria's public funds and 11 million
ECU (14.3 million dollars) from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that the program, which will last until the end of
1997, will especially benefit small and medium-sized enterprises.

<P>
He pointed out that only by securing a peaceful international
environment will China be able to develop smoothly.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the UN in 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced the
Chinese government's five propositions on how to further promote
mankind's peace and development and jointly create a better world.
</P>
<P>
The first proposition is to "create secure, reliable
international peaceful environment marked by long-term stability."
The second is to "strictly stick to the criterion on handling
international relations which focuses on sovereignty, equality and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people aspire for peace and seek development," the
article said.
</P>
<P>
To strive for a peaceful environment, China has made it a rule
not to form an alliance with any other country or any group, not
to participate in any military bloc and not to draw boundaries
over ideologies.
</P>
<P>
China has always believed it had a responsibility to oppose
hegemony, power politics and acts of aggression and expansion, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The article criticized people who advocate the "China threat"
theory, saying that they ignore facts, and that their vicious
attacks on China will not damage its dignity.

BRUSSELS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
today it was launching concrete initiatives to help rebuild and

<P>
The love for peace is at the root of China's traditional
culture, and the Chinese people who have suffered at the hands of
foreign powers will not impose similar circumstances on other
people, the article said.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 years ago, China's ancient philosopher
Confucius theorized that "peace is of paramount importance," and
Chinese poets throughout history have advocated that countries
establish and maintain friendly relations with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Such a spirit is deeply rooted in the soil of the national
culture, and has established the Chinese nation's temperament of
good intentions with others," the article said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the late Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong, who said, "We
will not attack unless we are attacked, if we are attacked we will
certainly counterattack." It explained that the Chinese nation
will not go to war with other nations unless the country faces
large-scale invasions from abroad which threaten national security.
</P>
<P>
History tells people that most of those countries who advocate
the "China threat" theory have invaded China before. During the
Opium War in the middle of the 19th century, western powers
launched heavy attacks on China. As a result, the country was
destroyed and the people had no means of livelihood, throwing the
nation into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, according to
the article.
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, generations of Chinese people
struggled persistently against foreign invaders to obtain national
liberation and independence, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Japanese imperialists mercilessly invaded China,
which once again pushed the country into a life-and-death
situation. The Communist Party of China led people throughout the
nation in a fight for freedom, and it finally overthrew oppression
and won national liberation and independence, the article said.

<P>
The Chinese people, who have suffered endless invasions and
humiliations from enemies, deeply value independence, freedom and
peace and sympathize with people who have been attacked and
oppressed.
</P>
<P>
"How can the Chinese nation, which aspires to peace while
accustomed to undergoing hardships, threaten others?" the article
asked.
</P>
<P>
There is no record showing China's invasion of other countries,
or that China stations any soldiers abroad. China's policy of
friendly-neighbor relations not only has helped ensure peace and
stability in the Asian-Pacific region, but also promoted economic
cooperation in the region, and contributed to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Western powers made the Chinese people realize that a backward
country is always a target of invasion, the article said. Over
the past 46 years, the Chinese people have made great progress in
changing the country's image, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China's current economy has experienced considerable
development and the living standard of its 1.2 billion people has
improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
However, China remains a developing country with low incomes,
and its modernization drives will require a long-term peaceful
environment. Therefore, the Chinese government and people view the
safeguarding of peace as a noble responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"Those who advocate the "China threat" theory do not know
China's national character and national history, and they refuse
to open their eyes to see China's realities. So how can they talk
volubly with animated gestures?" the article questioned.

The "China threat" theory maintains that the relations between
China and its neighboring countries will inevitably be tense.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China has close and friendly relations not only with
its Asian neighbors, but also with most countries throughout the
world, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"There are 158 countries in the world that have diplomatic
relations with China. We have friends all over the world," it
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Chinese people, as well as people who have
insight, have never regarded China as a "threat" to the world,
said the article.
</P>
<P>
"China has constituted no threat, either political or military,
to Asia. What we worry about is by no means a rich China, but a
poor one," Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was believed by the former ambassador to China of the
Republic of Korea that arbitrarily defining China as a "threat" to
the world and taking a hostile stand against China could only lead
to "unfortunate consequences," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Many military personages from China's neighboring countries
strongly criticized the "China threat" theory, and expressed the
belief that China is, and will continue to be, a main force in
maintaining the regional peace and stability in Asia, the article
said.

Even in Western countries, people who have a good understanding
of China's foreign policies and are willing to respect facts can
easily reach the same conclusion, it added.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Dick Macke, commander-in-chief of the Pacific Command
of the US Armed Forces, who visited China last year, was quoted as
saying, "China perhaps has the ability, but absolutely has no
intention to threaten the safety of others. China is no threat to
the world now, and will not become one even when it becomes
powerful in the future."
</P>
<P>
It said that Deng Xiaoping once pointed out that there
are two strategic issues in the world today: peace and
development. These are historical trends that no one in the world
can reverse.
</P>
<P>
The real threat to the world today is those countries which go
against these historical trends and try to violate other countries'
sovereignty, interfere with others' internal affairs, and sabotage
others' territorial and national unity under the pretense of
"freedom, democracy, and human rights," said the article.
</P>
<P>
"They will not escape the punishment of history," it added.
</P>
<P>
It promised that the Chinese people will work strenuously with
other peoples throughout the world for global peace, stability, and
development, as well as for the progress of all of humanity.
</P>
<P>
"The banner of peace will flutter high in the hands of the
Chinese government and people," it pledged.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Unhappy with Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- African leaders in Ghana have
expressed disappointment at the low direct foreign investment in
the continent despite the adoption of investor-friendly policies
by most countries, a report from Accra said today.
</P>
<P>
At a roundtable summit which was part of the international
conference on reviving private investment in Africa on Wednesday
night, these leaders said they were seeking partnerships and not
aid from the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit, characterized by emotional pleas by presidents or
their representatives, brought to the fore Africa's shortcomings
in attracting investment.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders, including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
were sceptical about how much economies should be opened up
without sacrificing national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking for welfare," said host President Jerry
Rawlings, "because we have appropriate skills to do a lot of
things for ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said privatizing crucial sectors such as
telecommunications could be retrogressive as most government
bills would be inflated.
</P>
<P>
"It is not everyone who goes into telecommunications for
economic reasons," agreed Mugabe. "some want to have their ears
everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe warned that some investors expected to control
economies and politics of countries in which they invested.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "we have to look at whether the role of
investment is for the development of economies or to extend
political control."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Rawlings emphasized that investment should be based
on partnership.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's first Vice-President Thabo Mbeki said developed
countries should show confidence in the continent's economies
first, for business people to be convinced there is a future in
investing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the United Kingdom, the United States and
Malaysia said bureaucracy and rigid foreign currency regulations
should be scrapped.

promote world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The article by Gao Jiquan, titled "China Holds High the Banner

than its relative strengths and weaknesses, will lead it to be
viewed as a threat to other countries.

pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace," the article
said. China consistently stands for expanding cooperative
relations with all other countries on the basis of the five

"China neither will impose its social system and ideology on
other countries nor permit other countries to interfere in its

China holds that all countries, big or small, strong or weak

"China believes the fundamental objective of its foreign policy

world peace and development, and oppose power politics and
hegemony," the article said.

<P>
Beginning July 1, Chinese people with valid visas who are
leaving the country will be allowed to bring or remit foreign

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Repatriates 244 Vietnamese Boat People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 244 Vietnamese boat people
returned to their home country Wednesday aboard the Indonesian
navy warship Kri Teluk Hading, according to reports reaching here
this evening from Batam, Riau province.
</P>
<P>
They were the first batch of refugees in Galang island, Riau
province, West Sumatra, to be repatriated under the orderly return
program (ORP) implemented by the Galang '96 humanitarian task
force, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government decided to repatriate Vietnamese
refugees following a decision of the United Nations to stop
financial aid to the boat people staying on Galang island.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
decided at the end of May to stop its aid till May 31, and all the
repatriation expenses will be borne by the UN agency.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which for the past 20 years has been sheltering
refugees in Galang island, is under pressure from the UNHCR to
repatriate the remaining 4,000 Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The number of Vietnamese refugees in Galang reached more than
40,000 in 1989, but many have since been resettled in third
countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States
and some west European countries. Others have returned to Hanoi,
the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Leader Meets US Undersecretary of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese army leader General Chi
Haitian told US Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe today
that relations between Chinese and US armies should be handled
from a strategic height with an eye on the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Slocombe and his party in Beijing this
afternoon, General Chi said relations between the armies of the
two countries can develop only with contact and dialogue between
military leaders of the countries.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining contact and dialogue between army leaders will help
promote mutual understanding and trust, said General Chi,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also defense minister, said that Slocombe's visit
has come at a critical juncture in Sino-US relations and their
military ties, and therefore, it will play a positive role in the
improvement and development of bilateral relations and their
military ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that a healthy and stable Sino-US relationship will
benefit not only the people of the two countries, but also
regional, as well world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Yet, he said, a healthy and stable bilateral relationship can
only be established on the basis of the principles laid down in
the three Sino-US joint communiques, with the Taiwan issue at the
core.
</P>
<P>
Any violation or deviation from such principles would harm
Sino-US relations, and the military ties between them would also
be impaired, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe said that during the visit, his first China trip, he
has exchanged views with Chinese army leaders on issues covering
political, strategic and military affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also explored with Chinese military officers new ways of
expanding exchanges and cooperation in national defense and
military fields, said the undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
The US target in its relations with the Chinese army is to
maintain dialogue and cooperation, Slocombe said, and he hopes the
two would build relations to resolve their differences by dialogue
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe and his party arrived in China on Tuesday for a
three-day visit at the invitation of China's Ministry of National
Defense.

<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine unemployment rate
fell to 10.9 percent in April this year, 1.2 percent down from the
same period last year, the Philippine Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office (NSO), the number
of unemployed Filipinos as of last April declined to 3.4 million
from 3.53 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The drop in unemployment was mainly due to an increase in the
number of people who work for less than 40 hours a week. Some of
these people look for additional hours of work.
</P>
<P>
However, full-time workers or those who work for at least 40
hours a week fell from 15.8 million to 15.1 million during the
survey period.

CANBERRA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
against the US dollar today to close at 78.99 US cents from
Wednesday's finish of 79.20 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Comments made by the World Bank about the dual currency Samurai
bonds caused investors to sell the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Samurai bonds are issued in Japanese yen and are redeemable in
Australian dollars. Expected issuance of Samurai bonds boosted
demand for the Australian dollar and helped to prop the currency
up against other currencies in the past week.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank said today that issuers of Samurai
bonds were too "enthusiastic," causing "knee-jerk" selling of the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Australian dollar ended at 86.37 Japanese
yen from 86.66 yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was also weaker against the German mark, ending at 1.2055
mark from 1.2114 mark.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Urges G-7 to Reduce Africa's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Mimister Meles Zenawi
today urged the G-7 countries to take concrete, all-inclusive and
practical action to mitigate Africa's crushing debt burden.
</P>
<P>
In a message he sent to President Jacque Chirac, chairman of
the summit of the G-7 countries which opens today in Leon,
France, Meles expressed his hope that the summit will give top
priority in its discussion to Africa's debt and development aid
to the continent.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), Meles thanked the G-7 countries for the measures so far
they took to reduce Africa's debt.
</P>
<P>
But development aid to the continent is declining while
conditions set out by donors are self-contradictory and have
impacted the quality and execution of aid, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meles said African countries have shown determination to take
full responsibility to reverse economic decline characterized by
conflicts in countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Unless supported by the G-7 industrialized countries in the
world, namely the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Germany,
United Kingdom and Japan, African nations can hardly bring about
sustainable development for the benefit of their peoples, Meles
said.

NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda
today urged the bank sector to play a crucial role in eliminating
the country's poverty.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 90th year celebrations of the public sector
Canara Bank in Bangalore, capital of Karnataka state in southern
India, Deve Gowda underscored the need to uplift the poorest of
the poor in the country and asked the financial institutions to do
more work for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of the country in the last 48 years was not
matching to the problems faced by the country because of "wrong
policy measures," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"If we have not taken efforts now, it would be a disaster," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the role of banks in the liberalization era, Deve
Gowda said that banks had the responsibility to keep deposits
safely and utilize for selfless service for the country. Poverty
could be wiped out from the face of the country just with the
interest generated from the deposits of banks and financial
institutions in India.

<HEADLINE> Benxi's Sustainable Development Mode Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has praised
Benxi, an industrial city in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
for its outstanding achievements in environmental protection and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Located in the mountainous area of Liaoning, Benxi is a leading
raw materials production base in the country. It became one of
China's most polluted cities in the late 1970s, and it was said
that even satellites could not detect it.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the city has adopted measures to clean up the
air by introducing different production methods and launching new
industries that use recyclable materials.
</P>
<P>
The city also promoted eco-agriculture and planted trees to
protect its environment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the Chinese government had spent a
total of 570 million yuan (about 69 million US dollars) to solve
the city's environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas You, a UN official, told Benxi Mayor Li Yingjie that
some countries say China ignores sustainable development, which is
not true in light of the efforts made by Benxi to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the city worked out a sustainable development plan,
which was listed as one of the most important projects of the
national development plan for the next century.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is expected
to rise faster in 1997, according to Natwest Markets, the
investment banking arm of the British Natwest Group.
</P>
<P>
Charles Li, the firm's head of economic research for Northeast
Asia, Hong Kong's economic growth will rebound to 5.1 percent in
1997 although it is slowing down this year,
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's gross domestic product grew by 4.6 percent last
year. The government forecast 5.0 percent growth for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Hong Kong's greater economic links with the
Chinese mainland would promote rather than hinder its economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's greater links with the Chinese mainland means that
Hong Kong's economy has become more dependent on the performance
of China's emerging economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's economy will grow at an average of 10 percent over the
next five years and it is expected to become a global economic
superpower in the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the year 1997 is not the end of Hong Kong's
prosperity. Hong Kong will continue to develop after the 1997
handover.

has roared into the late 20th century.
</P>

Every single family in Fenghuang Village owns a car. While most
Chinese families can only dream of turning ox-power into horse
powered petrol engines, every family in the village has seen its
dreams come true.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Urgent Action Urged to Tackle Environment Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A report prepared by 200
Australian scientists and specialists, circulated here today,
calls for urgent action to address pressing environmental problems
in the country's cities, regions and rural lands.
</P>
<P>
The State of the Environment report also highlights the poor
progress in addressing greenhouse gas emissions, saying energy
related carbon dioxide emissions has grown much faster than the
average for members of the Organization for Economic Development
and Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Set in motion two years ago by the former federal government,
these scientists and specialists examined a range of natural and
cultural issues affecting the protection of the country's
environment.
</P>
<P>
The habitats of Australia's rich diversity of species are being
destroyed at an alarming rate, the report says. Australian is
thought to be home to one million species, but only 15 percent of
these have been recorded.
</P>
<P>
The loss of biological diversity was perhaps the country's most
serious environmental problem, the report notes, adding that land
clearing was a major factor, with more than 600,000 hectares of
native vegetation cleared each year.
</P>
<P>
About 14 billion tons of soil was removed from Australia each
year, while some 29 million hectares of mainly agricultural land
were significantly acidified, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Other serious environmental problems listed in the report are:
</P>
<P>
-- Weeds cost the country 3.3 billion Australian dollars (2.5
billion US dollars) a year; and insects caused primary production
losses of around 3.1 billion Australian dollars (2.38 billion US
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
-- Motor vehicle emissions were the major contributors to air
pollution in the cities, motor vehicle emissions were likely to be
a major concern in areas of rapid urban expansion, average energy
consumption rose 37 percent per person between 1970 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
-- Prevalence of asthma could be as high as 30 percent and
appeared to have doubled in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit amounted to 8.11 billion U.S. dollars in the first five
months of this year, surpassing the 8-billion-U.S.-dollar target
set for the whole of this year, the Bank of Korea reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit last month stood at 1.44
billion U.S. dollars, bringing the total for the January-May
period of the year to 8.11 billion U.S. dollars, up 60 percent
from the same period last year, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that since arrivals of letters of credit in may
dipped 10.5 percent from a year earlier, it is feared that the
current-account deficit will surpass 10 billion U.S. dollars in
two to three months.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade balance last month recorded a deficit of
790 million U.S. dollars. Exports increased a mere 6.4 percent on
account of declining unit export prices of heavy industry and
chemical products like semiconductors and chemical industrial
products, while imports rose 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to increases in overseas travel expenditures, transport and
advertising costs, the invisible trade balance in May registered a
deficit of 560 million U.S. dollars, eight times as much as the 70
million U.S. dollars registered a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The invisible trade deficit for the January-May period of this
year amounted to 2.99 billion U.S. dollars, a 141-percent increase
from the 1.24 billion U.S. dollars recorded during the same period
last year.

SINGAPORE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The remaining 99 Vietnamese boat
people who had been in Singapore since 1990, were repatriated this
afternoon, as a Vietnam Airline flight took them back to the Ho
Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Danilo Bautista, head of the Liaison Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said at a press
conference at the Changi Airport shortly before the repatriation
that the 99 boat people left Singapore today under the UNHCR's
Voluntary Repatriation Program.
</P>
<P>
The 99 repatriants consisted of 60 male and 20 female adults,
13 male and six female children. This group was the last group of
Vietnamese boat people remaining in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
They had been living in the Hawkins Road Camp, which is located
in the northern part of Singapore, and administered by the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, Singapore has hosted a total of 32,457 Vietnamese
boat people, Bautista said, adding that the great majority of
32,364 were resettled to third countries.
</P>
<P>
Loo Cheng Yan, Singapore's Controller of Immigration, said at
the press conference that the Vietnamese Boat People (VBP) had
been allowed to enter Singapore in the first instance because of
the unconditional written guarantees of seven western countries to
resettle the Vietnamese boat people within three months of their
arrival in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"However, these guarantor countries have failed to honor their
commitments. As a result, the Vietnamese boat people have been
left stranded in Singapore, many since the early 1990s," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Singapore government has always treated the
Vietnamese boat people in a humane manner. "Unlike the camps in
the other countries, the Hawkins Road Camp was not a closed camp
and the Vietnamese boat people were not kept under surveillance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that many Vietnamese boat people even found
employment outside the camp and managed to accumulate an average
of 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 2,143 US dollars) each as
savings.
</P>
<P>
As all 99 of them agreed to return to Vietnam under the
Voluntary Repatriation Program, he said, the Singapore government
has given Human Financial Assistance of 760 US dollars to each of
the Vietnamese boat people "as a further gesture of goodwill".
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the last group of Vietnamese boat people in
Singapore started on June 13, this year, as the UNHCR had decided
to close all its camps in the region by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uneven Road to Reconciliation Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan has embarked on a
rough road towards reconciliation as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of
the Afghan Hezb-i-Islami, took oath as prime minister of a new
coalition government, with his old rival Burhanuddin Rabbani
remaining as the president.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar entered the capital city of Kabul Wednesday after
heavy shelling and rocket attacks by the Taliban militia who had
tried to stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in the past 16 years that Hekmatyar
made himself available in the city, and the second time for him to
assume the premiership under Rabbani's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, 50, is a major representative of Pushtuns who
account for nearly half of the Afghan population, while Rabbani is
a Tajik.
</P>
<P>
As far back as in the former Soviet occupation from 1979 to
1989, the Afghan resistance groups were marked with ethnic feud
and power struggle, which led to a number of clashes between
Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla and Rabbani's Jamiat-i-Islami
forces.
</P>
<P>
After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and the collapse of the
Najibullah regime in 1992, both Hekmatyar and Rabbani rushed to
Kabul to grab the central power of the country, igniting the
factional fighting that is still going on today.
</P>
<P>
Under a power-sharing pact -- the Islamabad Accord -- signed by
various Afghan parties in April 1993, Hekmatyar was appointed the
prime minister of the then government and Rabbani the president.
</P>
<P>
However, Hekmatyar refused to go into Kabul to exercise his
power, saying that he feared assassination plots by Rabbani's men
who had already occupied most parts of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The strife between the two men reached an apex on January 1,
1994, when Hekmatyar attempted a coup with Rashid Dostum, leader
of Uzbek militia, against the Rabbani regime.
</P>
<P>
With the coup attempt failing, Hekmatyar and Dostum established
a four-party opposition alliance, which included Hezb-i-Wahdat
headed by Abdul Mazari, who was killed by the Taliban in 1995, and
Nejat-i-Melli led by Mojaddedi.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban militia, a new player in the Afghan bloody
drama, emerged surprisingly at the end of 1994 and gave several
heavy blows to Hekmatyar's troops during its campaign aimed at
wiping out all the warlords in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, both Hekmatyar and Rabbani tried to draw the Taliban
over to his side, but the Taliban decided to erase both of them.
</P>
<P>
The student militia has been seeking to besiege Kabul since
October 1995, after capturing most of the Hekmatyar-held territory
and some under Rabbani's control.
</P>
<P>
Facing the growing common threat, delegates of Hekmatyar and
Rabbani started secret contacts at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite threats from the Taliban and objection from his
partners in the opposition alliance, Hekmatyar signed a
reconciliation pact with Rabbani near Kabul on May 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani made some concessions by offering Hekmatyar's side
portfolios of prime minister, defense and financial ministers in a
new coalition government. Rabbani's side still retains the key
positions of president, interior, foreign and national security
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani later also allowed Hekmatyar's troops to enter Kabul in
a bid to jointly defend the capital.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it is a major step in the Afghan
peace process that the two old rivals have rejoined hands. It
might become a model for other rival groups to improve their
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still too early to say that the long-running
Afghan conflict will switch to a road of peace.
</P>
<P>
The observers said the peace process would be difficult without
the participation of the Taliban, which has a large military force
and controls half of the Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, vowing to topple Rabbani's regime and unite the
whole country by itself, has termed the new government as
illegitimate.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Control Pork Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has decided
to take emergency measures to curb the rapidly increasing imports
of pork, effective for nine months from next Monday, Kyodo News
Service reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following the import curbs, the price of pork for making
processed ham and sausage will go up by about 24 percent from the
present 450.02 yen per kilogram to 557.19 yen, officials of the
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The new price will raise manufacturing costs at meat processors.
</P>
<P>
However, processors are now finding it hard to raise prices of
ham and sausage because of slow consumer spending, said an
official.
</P>
<P>
In just April and May, Japan's pork imports exceeded the
standard average by 19 percent, according to data released
Thursday by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Imports account for about a third of Japan's total pork
supply.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Changes for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
authority (TAZARA) is changing for the better with new facilities
installed to make it an important rail link of the southern
Africa region network.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA has installed new computerized communication facilities
such as the rail tracker, an advanced technical system capable of
doing 70 percent of work, the local press today quoted Joseph
Minsula, TAZARA Director of Marketing and Traffic, as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the new rail tracker system, TAZARA is able to track any
locomotive with ease and a customer can be advised of the
position of his cargo within seconds by use of the advanced cargo
information system computer, Minsula said.
</P>
<P>
Now TAZARA has a huge marshalling yard at Yombo Station a short
distance from Dar es Salaam to ensure speedy assembling and dispatch
of wagons, according to the TAZARA director.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the problems "in communicating information to
customers on transportation of their goods," TAZARA has "decided
to put up these computerized systems in order to compete with
other traffickers", the director said.
</P>
<P>
The revamping of the communication system has built confidence
in customers who in the past complained of having been kept "in
communicado", the director added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, TAZARA has made improvements in clearing
and forwarding frieght services, security system and express
passenger trains.
</P>
<P>
The 1,860-kilometer TAZARA from the New Capiri Mposhi of Zambia to
Dar es Salaam in Tazania is now equipped with adequate facilities
to deal with 5 million tons of freight a year.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Output to Reach 200 Million Tons in 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's onshore oil output is
rising steadily and will reach 200 million tons in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum
Corporation, said that will represent an increase of one third
over the present annual output of about 150 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"China will still rank fifth in the world in oil production at
that time," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The senior official explained that the country's onshore oil
strategy of stabilizing the output in eastern China's aging
oilfields, and developing new oilfields in western China has
started to pay off.
</P>
<P>
By injecting water into the ground to maintain oil output, old
oilfields in eastern China, which produce over 80 percent of the
country's total output, have succeeded in controlling the rate of
natural output decline within 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the oilfields have accelerated prospecting to push
oil production capacity to 64 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Wang expects that by the year 2000 the old oilfields in eastern
China will maintain their output at the current 120 million
tons. While Daqing, China's leading oilfield, will maintain its
annual crude output of 50 million tons until the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, western China has seen
fruitful results in oil exploration and production. Some 9 large
oil and gas fields, each with oil reserves between 50 million tons
and 100 million tons, have been discovered in the Tarim, Junggar
and Turpan-Hami basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
To date Xinjiang has verified total geological oil reserves of
1.94 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the coming 15 years will be the
heyday for Xinjiang's oil production. The annual oil output there
is expected to hit 25.9 million tons by the year 2000, or 16
millions tons more than the 1995 figure.

<HEADLINE> Fossilized dinosaur Eggs Found in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A nest of ten fossilized dinosaur
eggs, about 100 million years old, have been found in Yueliang
Village, Xiaerjiazi Township, Changtu County, northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The eggs were discovered when workers from a construction
company in Anshan City were driving a pile 16 meters below the
surface for the construction of a bridge on an expressway from
Tieling to Siping.
</P>
<P>
Some of the eggs were broken and all of the eggs have
shells. But five or six eggs were later stolen.
</P>
<P>
Ning Tian, head of a construction team, sent the rest to the
Liaoning Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists expressed the belief that the eggs were dated
from some 100 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The eggs were smaller than most dinosaur eggs, about the size
of a goose egg. Most of them are oval and one has a flat shape.
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhiming, a dinosaur researcher with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said, "such small dinosaur eggs are really very rare. I
think probably they were laid by some new species of
dinosaurs. But I don't know what species."

<HEADLINE> Rare Aquatic Animals Given Special Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen, known as a "garden upon the
sea," has set up nature reserves to protect rare aquatic animals
such as the white-flag dolphin, the lancelet and the green turtle.
</P>
<P>
The white-flag dolphin is one of the world's most endangered
species. With growing pollution in the region, the number of the
Chinese river dolphins has decreased, and now there are only about
200 -- fewer than the also-rare Giant Pandas.
</P>
<P>
After a careful investigation, experts mastered the
distribution information of the white-flag dolphin, then
established a preservation zone to give special protection to the
rare aquatic mammal.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian Provincial Government also made great efforts to
preserve the lancelet, which mainly live in the coastal areas of
Xiamen in east China's Fujian Province. Lancelet is important for
the study of the evolution from the invertebrate to the
vertebrate.

<HEADLINE> Province Beats Grain Shortages to End Rationing for Millions (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue of grain had long stemmed the economic development of
Liaoning, which paid attention only to the industrial expansion
until 1978, when the central and local governments began to grant
more funds, popularize agro-technology in rural areas, and
mobilize farmers' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
As a result Liaoning's annual grain output jumped to 12 billion
kilograms in the 1980s, and 15 billion kilograms in 1990, meeting
by and large the needs of the province's 43 million people, one
half of whom are urban citizens.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw Liaoning experience severe flood, but it still
reaped a grain output of 14.235 billion kilograms, averaging 350
kilograms per capita.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Wencai, deputy governor of the province,
Liaoning's self-sufficiency in grain supply has not only help the
province to develop industrialization and urbanization, but also
alleviated the burdens of other provinces, which had to supply
Liaoning with an average of 2.5 billion kilograms of grain a year
from the 1950s to the end of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting Liaoning province, Yang Yongzhe, deputy
director of the Development Research Center under the State
Council, spoke highly of the province for "setting an example for
coastal provinces and regions in solving the grain problem."
</P>
<P>
"It has enhanced the Chinese government's confidence in the
country's self-sufficiency in grain and non-staple food supply,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a stable grain production, Liaoning has vowed to
boost its annual grain output up to 17.5 billion kilograms by the
end of this century through increasing input, further protecting
farmland, spreading advanced agro-techniques while controlling the
population, he added.

MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today appointed Ivan Rybkin, former speaker of the State Duma
(lower house of parliament), to head the Political Consultative
Council (PCC), the Presidential Press Service said.
</P>
<P>
The new public body was formed by Yeltsin to replace the Public

The president offered PCC membership first and foremost to the
political parties and movements represented in the Duma and also
the political parties and movements that failed to win seats in
the parliament during the latest elections, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that by taking this step, Yeltsin is

<HEADLINE> Jilin Turns Sandy Land into Granary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The western part of northeast
China's Jilin Province, which used to be large tracts of barren
sandy land, has become a new granary in the province due to
improvements in the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The province is constructing shelter belts for farmland to
control damage from sandstorms, forestry experts said.
</P>
<P>
More than 170,000 ha of shelter forests have been planted in
the grain producing area in the west, which protect 2.53 million
ha of farmland with an annual output increase of 2.15 billion kg,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The province started the afforestation project to control
shifting sand in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The area now subject to sandstorm damage has decreased from 7.3
million ha in the 1970s to 310,000 ha, and the area of sandy land
decreased by 1.1 million ha, they said, adding that the western
region has the greatest potential for agricultural production in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Jilin will increase its grain output by five billion kg during
the Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) period, and 1.9 billion kg of
the planned grain output increase is expected to come from the
west. It now produces 1.9 billion kg of grain annually.

<HEADLINE> 7 Nonhemophiliacs Die After Receiving Tainted Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven people have already died from
AIDS after receiving blood products possibly tainted with AIDS
virus, Kyodo News Service quoted the Health and Welfare Ministry
as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They were among at least 12 nonhemophiliacs who were infected
with HIV after receiving blood products possibly tainted with the
virus, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry learned this as a result of its nationwide survey
with medical institutions to investigate how many nonhemophiliac
patients received unheated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows a total of 292 medical institutions in the
nation used the dangerous products during treatment for 2,233
nonhemophiliac patients, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Of the patients, 1,419 or about two-thirds were liver disease
patients and new-born babies. The seven who have died of AIDS
include an unknown number of such babies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has confirmed that 1,511 of the total patients had
already died before the survey began, making it impossible to tell
whether they were HIV positive or not.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Scientists Develop a Magnetic Thin Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese scientists have
developed a new type of magnetic thin film that could enable
computers to record considerably more data than they currently do,
Kyodo News Service reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They subjected carbon and cobalt plates to ion beams and
collected the particles which flew off on a glass substrate at
temperatures between 200 and 300 C.
</P>
<P>
The resulting particles in the film deposited on the glass
averaged 7 nanometers in diameter.
</P>
<P>
Magnetic film currently used to record data in computers uses a
cobalt-derived alloy, but the newly developed membrane has cobalt
crystals which are between half and a third the size of
conventional ones, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, since the cobalt nanocrystals in the newly
developed membrane are isolated from each other by the
graphite-like carbon, it has considerable potential as a medium
for recording data.
</P>
<P>
The scientists work at the NTT Interdisciplinary Research
Laboratories in Musashino, western Tokyo. The group includes
Takayoshi Hayashi, Shigeru Hirono, Masato Tomita and Shigeru
Umemura.

<HEADLINE> Province Beats Grain Shortages to End Rationing for Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
province has sown the seeds of success -- and said goodbye to the
days of grain rationing for its massive population of town and
city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The province's drive for grain self sufficiency was put to the
ultimate test in the past year when severe floods swept the area.
</P>
<P>
But Liaoning, China's leading heavy industrial base, reaped a
good harvest of 14-billion kilograms of grain -- enough to feed
its 43 million people of the province. There was also plenty of
grains to spare.
</P>
<P>
Now provincial leaders say the success is helping to boost the
province's mainstay industries by attracting investors.
</P>
<P>
They say that gone are the days when Liaoning was force to
purchased grain from outside to feed its own people.
</P>
<P>
A new survey shows that farmers in the Northeast China province
still have between 700 million and 800 million kilograms of
surplus grain in hand during the current temporary grain shortage
period -- the time when the new crop is still in the blade and the
old one has all been consumed.
</P>
<P>
In addition the province has put at least 220 million kilograms
of stored grain on the market each month to ensure the grain
supply.
</P>
<P>
An 80-square-meter grain shop in Huanggu district in Shenyang,
the provincial capital, was serving one afternoon only one
customer, an elderly woman who was buying ten kilograms of rice.
</P>
<P>
"Just a few years ago we were so busy selling grain to queues
of people waiting for their grain rations that we did not have
time to have lunch during similar grain-off seasons," said a shop
assistant, who disclosed that the grain ration system was
cancelled because of the sufficient supply.

<HEADLINE> China's First SOS Children's Village Celebrates 10th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's first SOS village in the
port city of Tianjin has held celebrations to mark the 10th
anniversary of its founding.
</P>
<P>
China now has five other SOS villages -- in Yantai in Shandong
Province, Qiqihar in Heilongjiang Province, Nanchang in Jiangxi
Province and Chengdu in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The 6,600-sq m village was sponsored by the municipal
government of Tianjin and the international SOS village
organization.
</P>
<P>
There are 18 families in the SOS village in Tianjin. "Mothers,"
who are mostly single women, devote their lives and love to the
orphans. They have become "mothers" of 208 orphans, and brought up
40 of them.
</P>
<P>
The "mothers" not only look after the daily needs of the
youngsters, but also learn psychology, and develop the childrens'
special skills.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 300 SOS children's villages in some 100
countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The world's first children's village was launched by Austrian
doctor Hermann Gmeiner in 1949. The SOS movement is a charity
organization. The villages are made up of families, each with a
"mother" and between five and eight children.

<HEADLINE> More Middle School Students Aspiring to CPC Membership (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Central Committee of the Communist
Youth League of China show that there are 15,159 student-CPC
members in senior and junior middle schools across the country,
with the majority in the senior years.
</P>
<P>
As an important reserve force of society, middle school
students, particularly the estimated 16.52 million seniors, are
expected to become backbones in various trades in the early
decades of the 21st century, and play a pivotal role in achieving
China's modernization targets. Therefore their beliefs and choices
are attracting increasing close attention.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Sheng, a 19-year-old student leader with the Shude Middle
School in Chengdu, has filed four application letters to Party
branches requesting for admission, but still remains on the list
of applicants "under consideration".
</P>
<P>
"I shall not give up my pursuit," he said, steadfastly and
undeterred.
</P>
<P>
Zhong's grandfather was mistaken as a so-called "Rightist" in
the 1950s and expelled from the Party. Firm in his belief in
Communism, he applied for admission to the CPC for 20 years
running and was finally readmitted in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"Through Grandpa I felt the enormous inspiration and influence
of the Communist Party on an ordinary Chinese citizen," Zhong
Sheng said, "I will follow the suit of Grandpa and hold firm my
belief in joining the Party."

<TEXT>
<P>
All middle schools in China have Party organizations and
branches that care for the ideological trends of the students, and
help them define their thoughts and beliefs, an official with the
CYLC said.
</P>
<P>
Party courses are open to all middle schools and have become
one of the most favorite courses among students. In some middle
schools, part-time courses are run to assist those active in
joining the CPC to familiarize themselves with knowledge and
theories of Communism.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Zhiyuan, an official with the Chengdu City Education
Commission, said middle school students are young and immature. So
the major task of Party organizations in the schools is to help
them further nurture and solidify their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"Only a minority of middle school applicants qualify for the
strict examinations," Zheng said. "Not everyone is so much
qualified as Gaisang Dawa."
</P>
<P>
Gaisang Dawa comes from a herdsman family of Maizhokunggar
County, Tibet Autonomous Region. He said his family now have their
own farmland, TV set, Hi-fi recorders and other modern household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we built a large house. My Grandma, a poor serf
in feudalistic Tibet, is happily enjoying her twilight years in
the building," Gaisang said, adding "all these improvements are
owed to the Communist Party."
</P>
<P>
An eye-witness to the great changes that have taken place in
his hometown and his family, the student Party member strongly
defend the CPC against reproach over corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
He said corruption did come up within the Party but they are
single and rare cases. The nationwide campaign to crack down on
corrupt activities in its ranks, including high-ranking officials,
is a strong indication of CPC's determination to stamp out
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC is an organization that dedicates itself to the welfare
of the broad masses and deserves my trust," Gaisang Dawa said, "I
will devote all my life to the cause of Communism."

CHENGDU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Facing the symbolic "axe and
sickle" red flag hanging on a wall, Gaisang Dagwa, middle school
student in Chengdu, capital city of southwest China's Sichuan
province, raised his right hand and took a solemn oath to dedicate
himself to the cause of Communism.
</P>
<P>
"I am lucky and proud of being admitted to the Chinese
Communist Party," Gaisang Dagwa, of the Tibet Middle School in
Chengdu, told Xinhua after the swearing ceremony held on the eve
of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Gaisang, 18, is chairman of the Students Federation in his
school, where the Party branch graded him as "excellent in both
learning and moral character."
</P>
<P>
At the same time 16 other students were sworn in to the Party
ranks, bringing the city's current middle school student-Party
membership to 50, according to the Party Organization Department
of Chengdu City Education Commission. The department said that
currently more students were actively applying for, and striving
to qualify for Party membership.
</P>
<P>
Over 98 percent of the 40,000 middle school students in Chengdu
said they believe in Communism, and 95 percent of them expressed
the hope of becoming CPC members, with 70 percent having already
filed applications to joining the Party, according to a latest
survey.
</P>
<P>
Chen Deshu, a sociologist with the Sichuan Provincial Academy
of Social Sciences, attributed the upsurge of middle school
students applying for Party membership to popularity of Communist
ideals among young Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental cause behind the phenomenon lies in the
remarkable success of reforms the CPC has launched, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Party Constitution, Chinese citizens above the age of
18 are eligible to apply for Party membership.

LHASA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Communist
Party of Nepal (CPN, Unified Marxist-Leninist) has reiterated that
the CPN has always regarded Tibet as an inalienable part of the

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Launches Water Saving Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has
launched a water saving campaign to combat the anticipated summer
drought.
</P>
<P>
"Forget the Turks, water is our biggest problem," Lakis
Christodoulou, Director of the Cyprus' Water Development Division,
was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that reservoirs are only 37 percent full, compared
to 59.6 percent at the same period last year. People need to be
reminded to conserve water wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, the water department is also
implementing a number of water-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
Supply to water boards is to be cut by 10 percent, while
water for agricultural use will be cut by between 25 and 40
percent. There will also be a strict ban on hosepipes for washing
pavements or cars and 100 Cyprus pounds (about 200 U.S. dollars)
grants available for town dwellers to sink boreholes in their
gardens for irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
In the long-term, the Water Development Division is planning
to build more dams.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever water we have this year was saved last year --
without dams we would have no water now," Christodoulou said.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island, mainly relies on rainfall
for water supply, already has more reservoirs per square
kilometer than any other European countries, with 101 dams now
operational -- most of them built since the country's
independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to use more water from sewage treatment plants,
mostly for soccer pitches and golf courses, where quality is not
so crucial," the director said.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the water supply shortage, the island's first
desalination plant is due to start operating in 1997. It will
supply 20,000 cubic meters of water a day.

LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 23 political
associations whishing to become political parties have bought the
registration forms from the National Electoral Commission of
Nigeria (NECON).
</P>
<P>
Sales closed on Wednesday, and each of the political groups
paid a non-refundable fee of 500,000 Naira (nearly 6,000 U.S.
Dollars), swelling NECON's coffers by 11.5 million Naira.
</P>
<P>
According to a NECON statement released on Wednesday, the
deadline for the completion and submission of the registration
forms is July 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
But NECON warned the associations not to conduct themselves as
political parties simply because of the buying of the forms.
</P>
<P>
"As we close a very critical page of the registration
exercise, NECON wishes to remind all the associations that,
completion and even the return of registration forms slated for
July 25, 1996, form only the prelude to verification of claims
and eventual registration by the commission," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Investigating Border Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel are investigating
an terrorist attack on Israeli border patrol along the
Jordanian-Israeli borders Wednesday morning, which killed three
Israeli soldier and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
The attack, the worst armed incident along the border since
the two countries signed a peace treaty in October, 1994,
occurred at about 8 a.m. Wednesday when an Israeli border patrol
was ambushed by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a routine Israeli patrol vehicle was fired upon
from "very close range by terrorists who apparently came from
Jordan."
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, King Hussein of Jordan expressed his
condolences to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the
victims.
</P>
<P>
However, an official Jordanian statement released Wednesday
said that there was no indications to suggest the armed group had
infiltrated from Jordanian territories or had retreated to them.
</P>
<P>
A senior Jordanian government official was quoted by the
English-language daily Jordan Times today as saying that details
had yet to be confirmed and this would be achieved through a
joint Jordan-Israel investigation already in progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to confirm the details of the incident and
the parties behind it and we are conducting a joint
investigation with the Israelis in line with the Jordan-Israel
peace treaty," the official added.
</P>
<P>
But, no certain information about whether the infiltrators did
in fact originate from Jordan was available.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Bankruptcy in Old Industrial Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese machinery plant
employing 8,000 people has become the biggest state-owned
enterprise in the country to be forced into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Managers of the 60-year-old plant in northeast China's Lioning
province applied to the court for liquidation.
</P>
<P>
The Third Machine Tool Plant of Shenyang has suffered losses
for years due to poor management performance.
</P>
<P>
As a large manufacturer, it boasts 400 million yuan worth of
assets. But its total debts are far higher, hitting 650 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The plant has been called a "vegetable firm" by Shenyang's
deputy mayor Jiang Xianzhi.
</P>
<P>
"They keep losing money and all efforts have been tried to no
avail, so they have to quit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang is the capital of Liaoning Province, which is one of
China's old heavy industrial bases and has 1,400 large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, one-tenth of the nation's
total.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the then Shenyang Explosive-proof Equipment Factory, a
small firm with less than 60 workers, became the first in China to
be declared bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
As the market mechanism has been playing a more important role,
some large and medium-sized enterprises in Liaoning have taken a
turn for the better, and some have become worse off, provincial
governor Wen Shizhen said.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy cases of large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises have continued to rise for the past two years, mainly
because of outdated technology and equipment, poor product
mix and inefficient management, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
While 30 percent of large and medium-sized firms are in good
shape at present, some 20 percent are said to be on the verge of
closing down, according to a survey by the provincial Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
"If those hopeless 20 percent continue to exist, they will
simply waste more resources," said Wu Qicheng, the commission's
deputy director.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have asked and supported the provincial
government to speed up renovation of the old industrial base, with
bankruptcy recognized as one of the effective ways.
</P>
<P>
The province witnessed its first bankruptcy case of a large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprise in 1994, followed by 16
similar cases in 1995. In an accelerated process, the figure for
this year soared to 62 by June 10.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that all bankrupt firms have been purchased by other
enterprises, which have made adequate use of their assets for
other production purposes.
</P>
<P>
During bankruptcy processes, local governments have given
priority to new assignment of workers in those firms. Nearly
30,000 such workers have either found other jobs or received
social benefits, and no social unrest has occurred, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governor Wen holds that in a market economy, it's
natural that some enterprises will survive and others will die.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to maintain all the state-owned firms in our
province. We just strive to enliven a majority, or two-thirds, of
them, and that will be good enough," he said.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Dongtun Village in north
China's Shageda Township has a kite making history spanning over
50 years. It is known as the "Kite Village" in Daming County in
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Every family in the village are traditionally good at making
kites. The difference between the past and present is that the
villagers used to make kites just for self entertainment, or the
fun of their children now they are making big money from them.
</P>
<P>
An average family can make 4,000 or 5,000 kites a year in their
spare, and some can even make more than ten thousand.
</P>
<P>
Some neighboring villages are cashing in on the success of
Dongtun by starting themselves to make and sell kites, but Dongtun
has become the main distribution center of kites. Their kites are
sold in more than 20 cities in China, including Beijing, Tianjin,
Xi'an and Guangzhou. Last year, Dongtun Village sold over 400,000
kites around the country.

TEHRAN -- The Iranian government today denied "any form of
Iran's involvement" in the Dhahran explosion which killed Tuesday
night at least 19 U.S. soldiers and injured 386 others in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, a spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
accused both the United States and Israel of brewing joint plots
to mar the prestige of Iran. "Attribution of such acts to Iran
arises from the U.S. and Israel's long standing hostility to Islam
and Iran," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also rejected the baseless accusations leveled
against the sovereignty of Iran by the Israeli regime, calling
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher as the elements supporting and masterminding state
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The United States would not reduce its armed
forces stationed in the Gulf region, U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said Christopher, who arrived in
Saudi Arabia Wednesday, made the remarks to reporters while paying
a visit to the scene of the truck explosion which killed at least
19 U.S. soldiers and wounded 386 others.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said his country would not yield to terrorist
threats and would be "very decisive while dealing with such
threats."
</P>
<P>
Christopher was accompanied during his visit to the blast site
by Saudi Foreign Minister Saoud Al-Faisal.

BELGRADE -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic will not run
in the country's elections on September 14 and has agreed to
resign as "president" after the poll, but only on certain
conditions, a senior Bosnian Serb official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In agreement with the Bosnian Serb leadership and due to the
horrible pressures by the international community and the
Yugoslavia, Karadzic decided not to take part in the elections,"
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic told reporters in
Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's decision is conditional on a guarantee by the
international community to recognize the self-declared Republika
Srpska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, as a state with full
sovereignty within Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He is also demanding that the international arbitrators
deciding the fate of the northern town of Brcko guarantee to give
the town to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, a port town linking the Bosnian Serbs' eastern and
western territories, is currently held by the Serbs who see it as
vital for their strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
PARIS -- U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in the
southeastern French city of Lyon Wedensday for a summit of the
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations, which is to open
today.
</P>

fight against terrorism has become the "first order of our
business."
</P>
<P>
"Our first order of business will be to focus the strength and
the energy of the G-7 on the continuing fight against terrorism,"
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Defeating these organized forces of destruction is one of the
most important challenges our country faces at the end of this
century and at the beginning of the next," the president added.
</P>

three-day summit, is expected to be given more attention as other
leaders of the seven countries echoed Clinton's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Confirmed to Have Met Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Israeli prime
minister's office confirmed today that a senior government
official has met with top Palestinian Negotiator Mahmoud Abbas,
which marked the first time a Likud government official met with
the PLO.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was secretly held last Wednesday between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold
and Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, in the West Bank town of
Ramallah or Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The officials declined to give any further details about the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the meeting was timed to
coincide with the eve of the Cairo Arab summit, held last
weekend, and designed to ease Palestinian concerns before parley.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gold refused to comment on the meeting, saying he
would not discuss anything related to Palestinian contacts.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear what the two discussed, but it appears
that Gold conveyed the government's desire for a sincere dialogue
with the Palestinians and its willingness to set up negotiating
teams for the future.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his election victory on May 29, Netanyahu
authorized Gold to make initial phone contact with Abbas, making
it the first time the Likud has officially made contact with the
PLO.
</P>
<P>
Gold then said he was "authorized to convey to Abbas that a
mechanism of contact with the Palestinian (National) Authority
will be made once the government is formed."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu said last night that
there would be a variety of channels in dealing with the
Palestinians, and this could involve the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to say if or under what conditions he
would meet with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Officials believed that a meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu was essential before any serious talks can begin on
the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for high-level talks, and that means Arafat
and Netanyahu," said Arafat's aide Nabil Abu Rudeineh.
</P>
<P>
When it happens, "I am sure the first meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu will be difficult, but I am sure it will be less
difficult than the first meeting between Arafat and Yitzhak
Rabin," the assassinated Israeli premier, said Ahmed Tibi, a close
adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also expected that such a meeting
will be necessary before any Israeli army's redeployment in
the disputed West Bank town of Hebron.

<HEADLINE> 440 Million Yuan Aid Needy College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The central government has
allocated 440 million yuan to aid financially-dependent university
students since 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to today's People's Daily, a recent survey issued by
the State Education Committee (SEC) showed that approximately
293,000 students are enrolled in the 34 colleges and universities
directly under the SEC.
</P>
<P>
About 49,700 students, or 17 percent of the total, have
financial difficulties, and 18,600 of them live in poverty, the
survey showed.
</P>
<P>
A near-complete financial aid system has been formed in
institutions of higher-learning to aid poor students by granting
loans, stipends and scholarship, or reducing or remitting the
tuition fees for some students who are in extreme financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 9.44-million-yuan loans were issued to aid 20,458
college students; 22.17-million-yuan work-study funds went to
60,375; and 17,77-million-yuan stipends went to 57,230.
</P>
<P>
Reduced or remitted tuition fees for another 3,267 students
totalled 1.58 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, about 276,212 outstanding college students were
awarded various kinds of scholarships totaling 76,38 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the SEC, more flexible policies are expected to be
implemented in the country's institutions of higher learning over
the next two years to assist financially-dependent but outstanding
students.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not to Succumb to Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government will not
succumb to pressure from international financiers in terms of
privatization until the indigenous people have the capacity to
take over, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted Mugabe as saying in Ghanaian capital
Accra on Wednesday it would be senseless to privatize now
although commercialization of various departments and parastatals
was underway.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we have said to the IMF (International Monetary
Fund), we do not need to be rushed into privatizing," he said
when launching the African Capital Markets Forum at the
International Conference on Reviving Private Investment in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Too many multinationals have already controlled key sectors of
Zimbabwe's economy, such as mining, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
If privatization preceded indigenisation, the parastatals and
government departments would fall into the hands of "just a group
of settlers", Mugabe warned.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the white minority, which represents
about one percent of Zimbabwe's population of about 10.5 million,
controls about 80 percent of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF last September suspended disbursement of the
100-million-US-Dollar balance of payments aid to Zimbabwe because
the government had failed to meet some major targets.

<HEADLINE> China's First High-level Economic Development Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOLMUD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Three years of effort have gone
into putting together the Kunlun Economic Development Zone in
Golmud, in northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
This is China's first economic development zone built on a
plateau, in this case the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a move that is
meant to exploit the resources of the Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
With 280,000 square kilometers of space, the zone has completed
a project to provide 6,000 tons of water daily, a 110-kv power
project, a heat supply project for 120,000 square meters, and a
300-line program-controlled telephone project.
</P>
<P>
It has also built 4,430 sq m of office space and 4,800 sq m of
commercial residential space.
</P>
<P>
With 560 million yuan in contractual funds, the zone has
introduced 164 development projects and registered 160
enterprises, which invested 70 million yuan in basic construction.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop the resources of the Qaidam Basin, local
authorities will contact more domestic and overseas businesspeople
to encourage them to put a larger amount of investment into the
zone.

HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply
Authority (ZESA) announced here yesterday that electricity
tariffs will go up by an average 18 percent from July 1, exactly
a year after the last round of tariff increases.
</P>
<P>
ZESA said in a statement, "for the 12 months since the last
review, the rate of inflation of the national economy has remained
above 20 percent."
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwe Dollar has not yet stabilized appreciably. In
fact the local currency has continued to weaken against the
currencies of the major trading partners," according to the ZESA.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign debt constitutes 25 percent of our costs, while
imports of electricity which are paid for in foreign currency
constitute 20 percent of total expenditure," it added.

<P>
During the same period, the prices of liquid fuel and coal
were also reported up by significant increases.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls for Actions Against Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has called on the international community to take
"necessary actions" against Syria if it "continues on the path of
terror."
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's English daily Jerusalem
Post, Netanyahu avoided using the phrase of "triple containment,"
which he used before the elections involving the same sort of
sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a containment policy. It's simply a policy that says
that we're not going to play by Syrian rules," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
"Syrian rules are that they lash out with terrorism 360
degrees, obviously against Turkey, against Jordan, and
increasingly against us, and I don't mean only Hezbollah," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu pointed out that the extremist Islamic militant
movements, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, are all based in
Damascus "perpetrating terrorist acts indirectly against Israeli
citizens."
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable. Syria has to know that a political
price will be exacted from Damascus if it continues," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu demanded the West to stop turning a blind eye to what
he called Syrian-backed terror. "I want to certainly persuade our
allies, and especially the United States, that this policy is
detrimental not only to our interests but to the interests of
others," he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether he would tell U.S. President Bill
Clinton when and under what conditions he would meet Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat or pull back from Hebron during
their scheduled meeting in Washington on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who has vowed no compromise on Israel's
self-claimed sovereignty on the occupied lands, said Israel
accepts with its "own interpretation" of the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242, regarded by others as involving trading land for
peace.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would uphold agreements reached by previous
governments, Netanyahu said this would be contingent upon Arab
"reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Palestinians to reconvene to revoke the
PLO Covenant, which called for the destruction of Israel, since
the Palestine National Council meeting in April constituted a
"partial step."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu suggested he favored steps to improve the
Palestinian economy, but he offered no timetable for lifting the
crippling closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip imposed since
late February following a series of suicide bomb attacks by Hamas
activists against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Dhahran Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
denied "any form of Iran's involvement" in the Dhahran explosion
which killed Tuesday night at least 19 U.S. soldiers and injured
386 others in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, a spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
accused both the United States and Israel of brewing joint plots
to mar the prestige of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Attribution of such acts to Iran arises from the U.S. and
Israel's long standing hostility to Islam and Iran," he was quoted
by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also rejected the baseless accusations leveled
against the sovereignty of Iran by the Israeli regime, calling
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher as the elements supporting and masterminding state
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He noted that dubious and wilful efforts seem to be underway
in the region in order to create suspicion among the neighboring
nations, which, in fact, is firstly aimed at paving the ground
for the expansion of Israel's political and economic influence
and finally bringing about a new regional security order, which
will be inclusive of the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the regional countries are vigilant
enough to block the "ruinous U.S.-Zionist policies" which are not
only meant to create a gap between the Islamic and Arab nations in
the region but also to discredit Iran.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has implicated Iran of having a hand in the blast in
the American base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, noting Tehran was
behind similar attacks in Lebanon and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Iran News published an editorial here today,
saying that "American forces should quit the region
unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
In principle, the daily said, "terrorism is to be
unequivocally condemned. However, regional observers believe that
such acts will continue as long as the American forces are
present in this part of the world, particularly in Saudi Arabia."
</P>
<P>
"We should not forget that Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of
Islam, enjoys a special status in the Islamic world. The country
houses Islam's holiest places, and it should be remembered that
Saudi Arabia's history is based on the Islamic principles and
that its previous rulers such as King Saud and King Faisel never
tolerated the presence of alien forces on their land," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that the fact is that under the
circumstances prevailing in the region, Saudi Arabia does not
need the American forces at all.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia, Iran and some other regional countries are
quite capable of maintaining peace here in a friendly
atmosphere. There is no need for the American forces and they
should leave the region immediately," it noted.

<HEADLINE> Indian Fishermen Plan Port Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian fishermen plan to
indefinitely lay siege to at least eight major ports in August in
protest against foreign trawlers being allowed in the Indian
waters, The Hindustan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Kocherry, chairperson of the National Fish-Workers Forum
was quoted as saying that prior to the planned blockade, he will
go on an indefinite hunger-strike pressing for the cancellation of
licenses issued to foreign fishing vessels operating on the Indian
seas.
</P>
<P>
Among the ports targeted for the blockage are Mumbai, Kandla,
Mangalore, Vasco, Vishakhapatnam, Madras, Paradip and Cochin.
</P>
<P>
The protests stem from the fear that the stock of fish will
deplete rapidly affecting the livelihood of 8 million fishermen in
the country if action is not quickly taken on the issue, reports
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Every morning, Professor He Zhimin
of Tianjin University boots up his computer and checks for E-mail.
</P>
<P>
About 200 teachers at both Tianjin and Nankai Universities have
linked up with the Internet, an increasingly popular information
network among Chinese intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
He Zhimin has used his access to Internet to prepare for an
international conference, and he receives several E-mail messages
on holidays.
</P>
<P>
China sold nearly one million computers in 1995, 40 percent
more than the previous year, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the computers sold last year were bought by
Chinese families for use in the home.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people have gradually recognized computers as a more
powerful instrument than typewriters, especially after the
popularization of networks such as Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I got access to Internet, I found that the distance
with the rest of the world has been shortened and the traditional
work method has changed," He Zhimin said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a three-month-old baby who suffered from a rare
disease soon recovered after a local research institute sent
medical information to the infant's doctors via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that China's computer market will show an
annual growth rate of 40-50 percent, and that one-tenth of the 100
million urban families in the country will have computers by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Granted 11 Billion Dollars in Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania received 11.1
billion U.S. Dollars in external financing commitments between
1989 and 1995, nearbly 70 Dollars for each person every year.
</P>
<P>
Aided population for the period was hovering around 26.6
million on the average, indicating an annual per capita 69.71
Dollars for the local recipients, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mainland received some 10.7 billion Dollars during the
period, while Zanzibar obtained 434.5 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Main benefactors were reported to be Denmark, the European
Union and the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNDP admitted in its report that funds flowing
from development agencies had been declining.
</P>
<P>
Norway's aid to Tanzania went down from 86,394,000 Dollars in
1991 to 60.1 million Dollars in 1994. The figure dropped further
down to 52 million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Swedish aid to Tanzania downed steadily from 124.1 million
Dollars in 1991 to 56.8 million Dollars in 1994, and then to 36.7
million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also reduced credit facilities from 29.2 million
Dollars in 1991 to 469,000 Dollars in 1993, although the figure
rebounded to 888,000 Dollars in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugges (UNHCR) has on
the other hand sharply increased its assistance to Tanzania, from
706,000 Dollars in 1991 to 1.4 million in 1994, and to 46.9
million in 1995, due to an increased refugee influx from Rwanda
and Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Elephants One Big, Big Happy Family in Shanghai Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- One big, big happy family --
that's Shanghai's popular elephant community, headed by proud
grandmother Banna.
</P>
<P>
Three generations -- a rare sight in zoos -- are living in
perfect harmony in the city zoo, to the delight of visitors.
</P>
<P>
It all started in 1972 when the oldest female Asian elephant,
Banna was captured using anaesthesia in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan
Province. She was given a new home in Shanghai Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Later a male elephant Bamo, now turned 31, was transferred to
the zoo from Beijing to act as her mate.
</P>
<P>
Banna gave birth to their first baby, a female, in 1978. Every
four years after that the two elephants watched the patter of
not-so-tiny feet as more offspring arrived. The latest, the sixth,
made her entrance early this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year their second daughter gave birth to a baby elephant.
</P>
<P>
Experts said a three-generation elephant family is a rare sight
in zoos and offers a promising way of saving the endangered Asian
elephants.

Kismayo and to the Kenyan border because of insecurity and food
shortages," the WFP statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In mid-may, some 600 Somali refugees arrived in Dadaab camp

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Inflation to Stay Higher Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Mew Zealand's Inflation rate
will stay higher than expected in the next three quarters, the
Reserve Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
In its biannual monetary statement, the bank said inflation
will not fall below its target of two percent before the second
quarter next year.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that the underlying inflation, which excludes the
effect of changes in interest rates and one-off price shocks, will
peak at a higher-than-expected 2.6 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Under New Zealand's law, the Reserve Bank has the
responsibility to keep the country's inflation rate between zero
and two percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank's latest predictions will dash the hopes of some
economists and exporters, who fear efforts to control inflation by
keeping the exchange rate and interest rates high will choke off
economic growth and exports.
</P>
<P>
But Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash said economic figures are
still showing a strong growth, despite some evidence of lower
business and consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank's efforts will feed through into next year's
inflation figures, with little or no effect this year.

<HEADLINE> Two Figures Reveal Dramatic Changes in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Since the mid-80s, China's
largest city has torn down two chimneys a week in its downtown
areas, and it has built 1,000 high-rises, about two thirds of the
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, Shanghai pulled down more than 1,000
chimneys in order to protect the city's environment and make room
for more high-rises, which now total 1,523.
</P>
<P>
A local resident said that since the chimneys have been removed
from the downtown areas and with the mushrooming of high-rises,
the living environment there is much better than before.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the existing high-rises are residential
apartments, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local environmental protection department
said that this change proves that construction in the name of
economic progress does not always damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the removal of the 1,000 downtown
chimneys, the city has been free from 108 million cubic meters of
waste gas and 14 tons of soot every day.
</P>
<P>
This has not sapped the vitality of the local industry, the
official said, adding that the city's gross industrial output
value jumped to 525.3 billion yuan in 1995, compared to 82.9
billion yuan in 1985.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of real estate, commercial, trade and
financial projects have been launched on the sites where the
chimneys were located, which gives a strong push to the tertiary
industry.
</P>
<P>
The tertiary industry accounted for 40.1 percent of the city's
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995, up from 30.8 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sanqian, research centre director under the Shanghai
Planning Commission, said that over the next 15 years two-thirds
of the factories in downtown Shanghai will either be removed to
suburban areas or be turned to tertiary industries on their
original sites.
</P>
<P>
By then, local tertiary industry is expected to account for
60-65 percent in the city's GDP, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai built 219 high-rises in 1995, and more than 200 new
ones will be put into use this year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Eradicate Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A massive drive targeting iodine
deficiency will be started by medics and local governments in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, which has vowed to wipe out disease
related to this by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is a high-risk area because the average content of iodine
in drinking water there is almost zero. The regional government
therefore worked out a series of disease-prevention measures, such
as the use of iodized salt, tea and oral tablets.
</P>
<P>
Tibet will publish regulations on iodized salt supplies, and
will launch an over-all examination of salt products on the
market. Substandard salt will be removed from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
All restaurants and canteens, especially those in schools, have
been urged to use iodized salt, while four processing plants that
add iodine to salt will be built in Tibet and go into production
next year.
</P>
<P>
Iodine will also be added to brick tea, a popular drink for
Tibetans, to give them enough iodine in their daily diet.
</P>
<P>
Iodine-rich pills have been introduced to 60 percent of Tibet
areas as a way to prevent deficiency diseases, and local medics
plan to expand use of the pills in the future.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Mercosur's Expansion (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chile is regarded as having the most dynamic economy in Latin
America. Its gross domestic product reached 67.3 billion dollars
in 1995, a 8.5 percent rise from the previous year. And its
foreign trade reached 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chile's association with Mercosur will benefit both sides. It
guarantees the former a sure market and boosts the bloc's
negotiating power and its attractiveness to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur members, particularly Argentina, have long been eager
to strike a deal with Chile so that they can use its west-coast
ports as a bridge for Mercosur exports to the booming Asian market
via the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Access to the sea was an important reason for land-locked
Bolivia to sign up to a free-trade deal with Mercosur. Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada welcomed the link, saying it
would help boost his country's exports by giving it access to both
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
This week's agreements are likely to pave the way for similar
deals with Venezuela, Colombia and several Central American
countries who have expressed a desire to join Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
They also reflect a growing world-wide tendency to form
trade blocs which boost trade and bring added international
economic influence and weight which countries couldn't achieve
individually.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union, set up in 1965 initially under
the name of the European Economic Community, has grown into the
biggest and oldest bloc. In 1994, the North American Free Trade
Area (NAFTA) was set up between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is the world's fourth largest trade bloc with a market
of more than 210 million consumers and the first regional union
formed solely by developing countries. It also appears to be
moving forward with fewer difficulties, partly due to the
complementary nature of the member states economies.

<HEADLINE> Political Forces Oppose Star TV's Entry Into India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- India's political parties have
expressed their opposition to the proposed move by the government
to extend uplinking facility from India to Mogul Rupert Murdoch's
Star TV, press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party asked Prime Minister Deve Gowda to clarify
his stand on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We stand by Jawaharlal Nehru's 1955 statement that foreign
media should not be allowed entry into India. It poses a threat to
our national security and sovereignty," Congress spokesman V.N.
Gadgil told The Times of India here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The P.V. Narasimha Rao government had turned down a similar
proposal for extending uplinking facility to foreign media
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI)
A.B. Bardhan said that the move "poses a great danger since it
will eventually impinge on our sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
viewed the development as serious and urged the government "not to
throw national security to the winds."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Star TV's Mumbai-based managing director Gene
Swinstead denied rumors that his company was moving its
headquarters to India from Hong Kong.

KUWAIT CITY, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States would not
reduce its armed forces stationed in the Gulf region,
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said Christopher, who arrived in
Saudi Arabia Wednesday, made the remarks to reporters while paying
a visit to the scene of the truck explosion which killed at least
19 U.S. soldiers and wounded 386 others.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said his country would not yield to terrorist
threats and would be "very decisive while dealing with such
threats."
</P>
<P>
Christopher was accompanied during his visit to the blast site
by Saudi Foreign Minister Saoud Al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also visited some Saudi hospitals where some of
the injured were admitted for treatment before flying home, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he would present a detailed report about the
tragedy when he was back home to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's deputy Defense Minister
Abdelrahman Bin Abdelaziz excluded any impacts of the blast on the
Saudi-US relations.
</P>

The strong blast took place Tuesday night at a Saudi Defense Ministry
compound housing American military families in the eastern Saudi

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Tighten Supervision Over Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine central bank plans
to tighten its hold on the banking system through the issuance of
new guidelines in the selection of bank directors.
</P>
<P>
The Business Daily reported here today that the central bank
is seeking authority for the Monetary Board (MB) to prescribe a
set of minimum standards for bank directors and officers.
</P>
<P>
These norms will be included among the amendments to the
general banking act to be presented to the congress.
</P>
<P>
Once it is given a legislative mandate to do so, MB plans to
subject bank directors to a "fit and proper" examination.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank acknowledges the right of banks'
stock-holders to elect its directors, it wants to have a say in
screening these people.
</P>
<P>
This is to ensure that the operations of all local banks will
be handled by competent people, and thus, pave the way for an even
healthier banking environment.
</P>
<P>
In the past, some banks, particularly small rural banks,
suffered financial losses due to mishandling by incompetent
directors.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fund Welcomed in Northeast China Industry Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China will use more
foreign capital in the next five years to upgrade its industrial
performance.
</P>
<P>
With a total area of 1.24 million sq km and a population of 120
million, northeast China is one of the country's major chemical
and energy industry bases. The bulk of foreign investment that is
here is attracted mainly by the region's sound industrial base and
abundant resources.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province will use 10 billion US dollars during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) to reform its state-owned
petrochemical, metallurgical, electronic and machinery industries,
according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The province will allow two-thirds of its over 1,200 major and
medium-sized industrial enterprises to receive foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province plans to inject nearly five billion US dollars,
40 percent of which are planned for overseas investment, for the
technical renovation of its industrial enterprises. It will use
more than four billion US dollars of foreign investment during the
five-year period that ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province will see 90 percent of its industrial enterprises
regraded through overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province in northeast China plans to use 2.5
billion US dollars over the next five years. Most of the funds
will be used to introduce advanced technology and equipment to
out-dated industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces had used a total of 22.65 billion US
dollars by the end of last year. Businessmen from more than 60
countries and regions have invested in the region.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Italy Coordinate Stance on U.S. Sanction on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today he has lined up with his Italian counterpart
on an unpopular U.S. law that sought to punish non-U.S. companies
doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said after their meeting here that he has forged a
common stand on U.S. sanctions with new Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came before leaders from the Group of Seven most
industrialized countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Canada, Britain and Italy -- meet in the French city of
Lyon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Europeans will tell the U.S. that the sanction
law violates world trade rules and that they will retaliate if it
tries to enforce it. The EU accounts for 45 percent of Cuba's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Canada, whose trade with Cuba stood at 515 million U.S. dollars
in 1995, has also strongly criticized the sanction law.
</P>
<P>
U.S. congress approved the Helms-Burton bill this year to
tighten economic and trade sanctions against Cuba after it shot
down two U.S. planes reportedly flying over its air space.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said Prodi and he also expressed a common desire to
boost economic relations. In 1995, trade volume between Italy and
Canada was 5 billion Canadian dollars (3.5 billion U.S. dollars),
an increase of 33.5 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  G-7 Summit Shifts Focus to Terrorism After Bombing  (By Shang Xuqian)  Part 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the world's seven
leading industrialized nations have found a convenient rallying
point for their summit which opens later today in Lyon, France,
after a terrorist bomb attack on a U.S. military air base in Saudi
Arabia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the three-day G-7 summit was marred to some
extent by the absence of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
canceled his plan at the last minute, preferring to stay at home
to prepare for next week's second-round runoff against communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who had been invited to previous G-7 summits, was
expected to hold bilateral talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and attend "seven plus one" discussions on peace in Bosnia and the
Middle East, the situation in Russia and nuclear safety,
environmental protection, the fight against drugs and organized
crime. But Yeltsin has sent Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in
his place.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of Yeltsin, among other things, the summit
between leaders of the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Germany,
Japan and Italy, was expected to achieve little.
</P>
<P>
However, tensions are expected between the U.S. and some of
the other G-7 members over its new law punishing foreign companies
trading with and investing in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
There are also differences between the U.S. on the one side and
Japan and Europe on the other over a new global deal on freeing up
the microchip industry.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the U.S. base in eastern Saudi Arabia has
therefore provided a timely and welcome shift in attention to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Although the issue was already on the agenda, U.S. President
Bill Clinton said before leaving for the summit, that the fight
against terrorism will be "our first order of business."
</P>
<P>
"Our first order of business will be to focus the strength and
the energy of the G-7 on the continuing fight against terrorism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will lead the way and we expect our allies
to walk with us hand in hand," the president said.

<HEADLINE> India to Quicken Foreign Investment Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to abolish the Empowered Committee on Foreign Investment
in a bid to quicken foreign investment clearance, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of the Empowered Committee coupled with the
transfer of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) from the
prime minister's office to the Industry Ministry would hasten the
clearance process, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Empowered Committee, chaired by the finance minister and
comprising other ministers concerned, has so far been working as
the final approving authority for foreign investment projects up
to 3,000 million rupees ( 89.55 million US dollars) cleared by
FIPB.
</P>
<P>
Now the power vested in this ministerial panel will rest with
the industry minister.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry is considering a planning commission
proposal to raise the ceiling of foreign equity participation from
the existing 51 percent to a maximum of 74 percent for projects in
the country's high priority industries, the same sources added.

<P>
Other G-7 leaders echoed Clinton's remarks when responding to
the fuel truck bomb attack Tuesday on a military housing complex
in Dhahran, which killed at least 19 U.S. servicemen stationed
there and injured more than 300.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major described the attack as "an
appalling act, an act of pure evil, for no reason."
</P>
<P>
He also referred to a bomb explosion in downtown Manchester on
June 15, saying that "we have had all too much of this sort of
experience, this unprovoked bomb, the murder of innocent people."
</P>
<P>
Britain has been a target of bomb attacks by the Irish
Republican Army, which is fighting to oust Britain from Northern
Ireland and re-unite the province with the Republic of Ireland in
the south.
</P>
<P>
France, a victim of terrorist attacks by Algerian Islamic
militants, said in a Foreign Ministry statement that "terrorism
should be fought without fail, no matter where it comes from and
who its authors may be."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said: "Terrorism
cannot be justified for any reason."
</P>
<P>
Germany also showed solidarity with the U.S. over the attack and
expressed condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The summit is due to consider a package of 40 recommendations to
combat terrorism, organized crime, illegal immigration and drug
trafficking worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The summit will begin this evening local time with a dinner and
a whole day will be devoted to discussions on Friday, with a
foreign ministers meeting and wrap-up news conference on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders will issue an economic communique and a
political declaration.
</P>
<P>
The economic discussions will center on the globalization of
the world economy, unemployment and aid for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the world economy, on the one hand, has
helped boost economic liberalization and economic growth but on
the other, poses a threat to those economies that lag behind the
globalization tempo and are unable to face the increasingly fierce
international economic competition.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will discuss the advantages and drawbacks of
economic globalization and ways of effectively curbing the
repercussions of globalization on employment, financial stability,
international trade and aid.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who is chairing a G-7
summit for the first time, has also invited U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, World Bank President James Wolfensohn,
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus and
World Trade Organization Director-General Renato Ruggiero to
discuss debt relief, aid and trade, in an acknowledgement that the
seven countries can't fight these problems alone.
</P>
<P>
The political agenda will include discussing ways to speed up
aid for reconstruction in Bosnia, devastated by a
three-and-a-half-year war, and resettling refugees.

<HEADLINE> 126,000 College Students Become Chinese Communist Party Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Three percent of all college
students in China are members of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Education Commission (SEC) said that the
CPC has 126,000 college student members, and that many more
applied to join, as the 1,057 colleges and universities across the
country have become dedicated to strengthening Party building in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The rate of student CPC members increased to more than three
percent in 1995 from less than one percent in 1989. The rate among
students seeking master's or doctor's degrees last year was 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
The SEC sources said that Party schools, which have been
established in Chinese colleges and universities, played an
important role in educating Party members, leaders, teachers,
students and those who asked to join the Communist Party about its
belief and practices.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities also strengthen ethics education in
order to help students form an ethical perspective on the world,
life and values. CPC members make up 43 percent of all college
instructors in the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,600 students from Beijing University, one of
China's most prestigious universities, have applied for CPC
membership. There were 525 new student CPC members in 1995, 214
more than in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Among students from 45 Shanghai-based colleges and
universities, nearly 7,000 are CPC members and another 30,000 have
applied for membership. More than seven percent of all four-year
college students in Shanghai are CPC members, and one out of every
four students dong post-graduate work has joined the Party.
</P>
<P>
Many students in colleges and universities in Shanghai, such as
Shanghai Jiaotong University, Fudan University and Tongji
University, formed groups to study the Party constitution.
</P>
<P>
Some reports from the Chinese media said that the successes
achieved by the Party and government in political and economic
reforms, micro-control of national economy, anti-corruption, and
price control helped colleges students connect their individual
development with the fate and prosperity of the Party and the
country.

BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will launch a
campaign next month to stop the spread of cardiovascular disease,
which accounts for 27 percent of the total number of deaths in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The "Love Your Heart, Protect Your Heart" drive will include a
public awareness campaign, health consultations, and free blood
tests for cholesterol and fat levels, today's "Beijing Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government hopes to teach Beijing residents the
basics of cardiovascular health and inspire healthy living
habits, the report quoted Jin Dapeng, vice-director of the Beijing
Public Health Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular illnesses have become the
biggest threat to the health of Beijing residents. Both diseases
kill about 30,000 people in the city each year, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
In some urban districts of Beijing, 20 percent of the residents
suffer from hypertension. And 33.7 percent of people in 15-69 age
group are overweight, which increases the risk of cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
The citywide disease control drive will be funded by World
Bank loans, the report said.

<P>
France, a victim of terrorist attacks by Algerian Islamic
militants, said in a Foreign Ministry statement that "terrorism
should be fought without fail, no matter where it comes from and
who its authors may be."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said: "Terrorism
cannot be justified for any reason."
</P>
<P>
Germany also showed solidarity with the U.S. over the attack and
expressed condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The summit is due to consider a package of 40 recommendations to
combat terrorism, organized crime, illegal immigration and drug
trafficking worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The summit will begin this evening local time with a dinner and
a whole day will be devoted to discussions on Friday, with a
foreign ministers meeting and wrap-up news conference on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders will issue an economic communique and a
political declaration.
</P>
<P>
The economic discussions will center on the globalization of
the world economy, unemployment and aid for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the world economy, on the one hand, has
helped boost economic liberalization and economic growth but on
the other, poses a threat to those economies that lag behind the
globalization tempo and are unable to face the increasingly fierce
international economic competition.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will discuss the advantages and drawbacks of
economic globalization and ways of effectively curbing the
repercussions of globalization on employment, financial stability,
international trade and aid.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who is chairing a G-7
summit for the first time, has also invited U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, World Bank President James Wolfensohn,
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus and
World Trade Organization Director-General Renato Ruggiero to
discuss debt relief, aid and trade, in an acknowledgement that the
seven countries can't fight these problems alone.
</P>
<P>
The political agenda will include discussing ways to speed up
aid for reconstruction in Bosnia, devastated by a
three-and-a-half-year war, and resettling refugees.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Calls for Constitutional Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today ordered that a nationwide referendum be held on a draft
constitution on September 25, after a fractious parliament was
unable to approve the charter.
</P>
<P>
Dmitro Tabachnik, Director of the Presidential Office, said the
order was signed by Kuchma at the request of the National Security
Council. He said the council believed that any further delay in
the adoption of the constitution threatens the nation's internal
stability and democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
Tabachnik accused some political forces in the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) of having no desire to work constructively and of
refusing to consider the president's proposals.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Kuchma and Supreme Soviet Chairman
Vladimir Moroz, the draft constitution should have been adopted
before June 8. However, the parliament was still in the process of
the second reading on June 21.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the right wing in parliament believed an
item-by-item review of the draft constitution in the second
reading was a deliberate delaying tactic of the left wing, who
were waiting for the results of the Russian elections.
</P>
<P>
Before Kuchma signed the order, Moroz warned today that if the
president decided to hold a national referendum, the parliament
would take appropriate measures according to law.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said any decision on a referendum could only be made
jointly by the president and parliament. If the president exceeds
his authority, he said, his act will be blocked by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said a referendum, far from ending the crisis, "will make
it even deeper."

<HEADLINE> Bank Accounts of India's Key Accused in Scam Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) of India has frozen the bank accounts of the
key accused Prakash Chandra Yadav in the multi-crore urea scandal.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Yadav, son of former minister Ram Lakhan Yadav, is
understood to have bank accounts in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bombay
and Calcutta and had more than 100 million rupees ( 2.99 million
US dollars ) as deposits in several banks in the four cities, the
CBI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign accounts of the key accused are yet to be frozen,
the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked the
directorate of enforcement to probe the scam since a huge amount
of foreign currency is involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
Sanjeeva Rao, nephew of former prime minister Narasimha Rao, is
reported to have received 2 million dollar kickbacks in the urea
import deal. The CBI has already arrested him and Chandra Yadav
for this reason. Prabhakar Rao, son of former prime minister Rao,
is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The entire 39.70 million dollar urea import deal had been paid
in advance in December last year, yet not a gram of the 200,000
tons of urea reached India so far. Under the contract for import
of the urea between National Fertilizers Limited and a Turkish
firm signed on October 31 last year, 75,000 tons of urea was to
arrive by April this year.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Vows to Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel
Lazarenko said today that his government will continue improving
investment environment in an effort to attract more foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks at an international
conference of private entrepreneurs, now being held in Ukrainian
capital of Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko said that Ukraine needs at least 40 billion
U.S. dollars of funds to get out of the present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the money will have to come from foreign
sources, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko admitted that political upheavals and lack of
legislation have hindered the attraction of foreign investments in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that Ukraine has intensified
legislation this year. A foreign investment law was approved in
March, which was followed by a series of resolutions on the
privatization of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko announced that the government has selected five
state-owned enterprises in metallurgical and automobile industries
for foreign investment, and tender invitations will be issued
soon.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Develops New Logging Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A new logging technique is being
developed in Indonesia to limit the damage caused by incorrect
logging practices, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Toga Silitonga, head of the Ministry of Forestry's Research and
Development Agency, said at a workshop on forestry held here on
Wednesday that the technique, which aims to minimize logging waste
and environmental destruction, is being developed by the agency in
collaboration with France.
</P>
<P>
"Incorrect logging practices are the cause of up to 35 percent
of the forest destruction in Indonesia," Silitonga said.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Indonesia started the research, known as the strek
project or the sylvicultural technique for the revitalization of
logged-over forests in East Kalimantan province, and it is
scheduled to be completed in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Silitonga said that selective cutting and planting can reduce
the negative impact of clear-cutting by at least 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that Indonesia's forests are
shrinking at a rate of 809,000 hectares a year with the land being
used for transmigration, agriculture and plantation projects.
</P>
<P>
The government claimed that Indonesia presently has 144 million
hectares of forests, of which 21 percent are designated as
protection forests (for water and soil protection); 13 percent as
nature reserves and national parks (for nature preservation); 22
percent as limited production forests; 23 percent as regular
production forests and 21 percent as convertible forests.

The four-volume work, Kazakhstan History, is jointly compiled

Some investors considered an increase in orders can lead to

KATHMANDU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Two elephants of a wildlife park
in western Nepal have played havoc with some neighboring villages
in the last two weeks, a source from the affected area said today.
</P>
<P>
The nearly three-meter-tall elephants, of the Chitwan National
Wildlife Park, often came out at early evening and returned to
jungles in the park the next morning after wandering around the
villages overnight and destroying houses, the source said.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed in such an attack two weeks ago and about
100 villagers have lost their homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pachyderms also ravaged paddy and maize crops and pulled
down cattle sheds at these villages.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers had tried to use 24 domestic elephants to fight
against the two invaders, but the docile elephants were scared
away on seeing their big wild relatives, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The government then sent a team of army soldiers to drive away
the unwelcome elephants.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Donations to the China Welfare
Foundation for the Disabled reached 32.15 million yuan (3.87
million US dollars) last year, according to an official's report.
</P>
<P>
More than 27 million yuan (3.2 million US dollars) of the
donations from home and abroad was allocated to local regions and
spent on programs of rehabilitation, education and cultural and
sports activities for China's 60 million disabled people, said
Deng Pufang, chairman of the foundation's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Deng said 21 percent of the donations came from domestic firms,
social institutions and individuals. Overseas donations amounted
to 25.41 million yuan, or 79 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Deng, also director of the China Disabled Persons' Federation,
expressed his sincere appreciation to all donors at the annual
meeting of the board of the directors of the federation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The donated funds and materials played an important role in
further enhancing the country's work for the benefit of disabled
people in China and helping fulfill the country's goals set for
last year," today's "China Daily" quoted Deng as saying.
</P>
<P>
"China achieved unprecedented progress for disabled people in
the past five years, with the state providing rehabilitation
services to a total of 2.08 million people with disabilities and
improving their physical conditions in various ways," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
The number of special schools was increased by 559 to 1,379
from 1990 to 1995, and special classes by 3,859 to 6,510. Many
disabled children now attend ordinary schools, and their schooling
rate has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The employment rate for both urban and rural disabled people
has risen from 60 percent to 70 percent, with about one million
disabled people running their own businesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, recently
finished the outline of a project for the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) to help the country's disabled people participate in
all aspects of social life.
</P>
<P>
According to the outline plan, a further three million disabled
people will receive rehabilitation services, and many more will
gain new opportunities for normal education, technical training
and employment by 2000.

BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents each have a
living space of 9.02 sq m -- 2.5 sq m more than they had in 1990,
according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
The city has emphasized residential construction over the past
few years, said Wang Zongli, director of the Beijing Municipal
Urban and Rural Construction Committee.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the investment in residence construction
accounted for 12 percent of the total of all construction
projects, Wang said. As a result, the living conditions of nearly
700,000 households improved.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a record 120,000 households in the city could claim
a better living situation.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the municipal government has set aside
special funds to assist low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the city has sold living spaces to nearly 20,000
poor families at cost prices; half of them were offered houses in
1995.
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 100,000 families are expected to move
into new quarters, including 11,000 poor families, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, all families with a per capita living space below four
sq m will have improved living conditions, Wang said.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The signing of a free trade
agreement between the South American Common Market (Mercosur) and
Chile does not mean that Chile will become a full member of the
block, but the move is seen as a part of drive toward Latin
American integration and could pave the way for other countries to
join the union,
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed Tuesday by the presidents of Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, the four members of Mercosur, and
Chile at the 10th Mercosur summit meeting in San Luis, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The document, which will come into effective on October 1,
1996, establishes a new tariff system and the different norms for
Chile's trade with Mercosur countries.
</P>
<P>
General tariffs will be reduced initially by 40 percent on 90
percent of the products traded bilaterally between Chile and the
four Mercosur countries. Then they will be cut by 6 percent
annually and eliminated entirely by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on the other 10 percent of products disappear
completely in the years 2003, 2005 and 2010 respectively, which
will mark Chile's full entry into Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The free-trade market to be formed by Mercosur and Chile will
have a combined land area of more than 13 million square
kilometers, a population of 220 million, a gross domestic product
(GDP) of 900 billion dollars, and a foreign trade of 185 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is hammered out after two years of tough
negotiations because proper terms had to be found for the
commercialization of very sensitive products, particularly
agricultural ones.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has taken into consideration the positions and
intetests of all parties.

the history of life's evolution from ocean to land.
</P>
<P>
At a farm near Rockhampton, a Queensland coastal city 1,150
kilometers north of Sydney, scientists unearthed three fossils of
amphibious creatures that lived 333 million years ago, the
earliest of their kind ever known in the world.
</P>
<P>
This meant that the history of animals with a backbone living
on land might began in the southern hemisphere, or Australia,
rather than in the northern hemisphere, said Tony Thulborn, one of
the paleontologists who unearthed the fossils.
</P>
<P>
Before this, all other fossil evidence of earliest land
creatures had been discovered in North America, Greenland and
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the Down Under fossils dated back to the lower
Carboniferous period, near the time of 370 million years ago when
the transition from fish to amphibians took place.
</P>
<P>
In a report published in the latest issue of the international
scientific journal Nature, Thulborn of the University of
Queensland and his colleagues said the three Australian amphibians
were each the oldest known example of their type found anywhere in
the world. Two of them had never been found outside North America
or Europe.
</P>
<P>
When fully grown, the amphibians reached one meter in length.
They had strong tails, a massive head with lots of nasty teeth and
four feeble legs with separate figures and toes, Thulborn said.
</P>
<P>
"They were tied largely to water for reproduction and would
have tadpoles with external gills," he told the Sydney Morning
Herald.
</P>
<P>
One of the three amphibians belongs to a group called
anthracosaurs, which were ancestors of reptiles, birds, mammals
and people.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are trying to unearth more fossils from deeper rock
layers on the site in Rockhampton.
</P>
<P>
"As yet we don't have enough material to know what exactly what
we've got, so we can't answer how this transition (from fish to
amphibians) happened. We might not ever get it, but now we have a
chance," amphibian expert Anne Warren said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Church Arson Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday voted
98-0 to approve its version of a bill aimed at Stiffening
penalties on arson fires at nearly 40 predominantly black churches
across the South over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Senators Ted Kennedy, Democrat from
Massachusetts, and Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina,
is designed to raise federal penalties for church arson, and
grants local as well as federal law enforcement agencies extended
powers to track down and prosecute arsonists.
</P>
<P>
"This wave of arsons, primarily directed at African American
churches, is a reminder of some of the darkest moments in our
history, when African Americans were mired in a quicksand of
racial injustice." Kennedy said. "We need to do all we can
together to combat this shameful epidemic and bring the
perpetrators to justice."
</P>
<P>
The Senate's Church Arson Protection Act raises federal
penalties for those convicted of church arson from 10 to 20 years
imprisonment, and broadens the statute of limitations for such
crimes from five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
The bill also authorizes funds to the Justice and Treasury
Departments for additional investigators, and for programs to
train local law enforcement agencies in arson prevention and
investigative procedures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill would allow the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to set up a low-interest loan program for the
reconstruction of churches whose congregations could not afford to
insure their property.
</P>
<P>
The House bill, which was approved 422-0 last week, strips
federal regulations that call for the involvement of federal law
enforcement agencies in the investigations of such attacks only if
it has been proved perpetrators crossed state lines to commit
their crime.
</P>
<P>
Both chambers will now go to conference to craft a compromise
between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, President Bill Clinton told the leaders of
several religious denominations at a prayer breakfast that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency will make available to
churches arson prevention workshops and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The president also met with a group of leaders of major
national fire and emergency services organizations.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Agrees to Resign, Not Run in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic will not run in the country's elections on September 14
and has agreed to resign as "president" after the poll, but only
on certain conditions, a senior Bosnian Serb official said today.
</P>
<P>
"In agreement with the Bosnian Serb leadership and due to the
horrible pressures by the international community and the
Yugoslavia, Karadzic decided not to take part in the elections,"
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic told reporters in
Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's decision is conditional on a guarantee by the
international community to recognize the self-declared Republika
Srpska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, as a state with full
sovereignty within Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He is also demanding that the international arbitrators
deciding the fate of the northern town of Brcko guarantee to give
the town to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, a port town linking the Bosnian Serbs' eastern and
western territories, is currently held by the Serbs who see it as
vital for their strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Although Karadzic says he will not run in the elections, he
will stay as head of his ruling Serb Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Under last November's Dayton peace accord which ended the
nearly four-year war in Bosnia, Karadzic cannot hold office as he
has been indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the
Hague as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's offer to resign was made under mounting pressure
from the international community and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, who believe his continued presence in office is a
threat to the Bosnian peace process and the post-war nation-wide
elections in September.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the international community's High Representative
in Bosnia Carl Bildt threatened renewed sanctions against the
Bosnian Serbs unless Karadzic quit, following on from Milosevic's
strongly-worded ultimatum on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's conditions for resigning were rejected by Bildt. He
said the only acceptable condition was that the Bosnian Serbs
abide by the Dayton peace accord which states that indicted war
criminals must quit office and go on trial at the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Tuesday ordered the president-controlled public committee to be
changed into a political consultative committee, Interfax and
Itar-Tass news agencies reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the president issued the order at the
suggestion of several political parties and organizations and he
invited Ivan Rybkin, the former chairman of the State Duma, to
head the new body.
</P>
<P>
The body's main functions are to discuss the draft plans of the
president and the government on political, economic, social issues
and help them draft bills on political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin won 33.77 percent of votes in the first round of
presidential elections on June 16, a narrow lead of 3 percent
ahead of his communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
To boost his chances of winning the run-off election on July 3,
Yeltsin sacked Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and seven other
generals recently. The reform of the public committee is widely
seen as another of his series of moves toward his goal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Defense Minister Urges PDI Factions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense and Security
Minister Edi Sudradjat appealed to the bickering factions of the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to unite for the good of the
nation and the party, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If there are two camps claiming the party's leadership, they
should meet. They are part of the same family after all," the
minister told reporters after a hearing of the house of
representatives' Commission on Security on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PDI's leadership is split into two factions: one under
Soerjadi which was formed at a rebel congress held from June 20 to
22 in Medan, capital of north Sumatra province. It has the support
of the government and the military; the other faction is headed by
Megawati Soekarnoputri, daughter of late president Soekarno. It
relies on the support of loyal party members.
</P>
<P>
After receiving official recognition as the PDI's leader,
Soerjadi wants to regain control of its headquarters in central
Jakarta. the office is occupied and guarded around-the-clock by
hundreds of Megawati supporters.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi said he would wait for all 39 members of the Central
Executive Board, who were elected at the Medan congress, to arrive
before he would decide when to take the office.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces have promised to help Soerjadi take the
headquarters if asked, but police said yesterday they had not
received any request for assistance.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police have been stationed around the PDI
headquarters to maintain peace and order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alexander Litaay, secretary-general of the Megawati
faction's board, said yesterday that his camp had no intention of
giving up the headquarters, maintaining that Megawati had the
legal right to leadership.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to undertake an
independent inquiry into the legality of last week's congress.
</P>
<P>
Megawati has also announced she intends to sue minister of home
affairs and the national police chief for allowing the congress to
proceed. A separate suit against the rebel PDI members who
organized the congress is also planned, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has three parties, namely the United Development
Party (PPP), the Indonesia Democratic Party (PDI) and one
functional group (the Ruling Golkar).

<HEADLINE> Foreign Beers Raised Highly Into China Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major foreign beers
have bubbled into China's beer market in a bid to win a big share
in the world's second largest market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign beer brands can now be seen everywhere in cities and
large towns, from the country's north to south, in shop windows,
restaurants, and hotels. Some of them are even served at the
dining tables of well off farmers in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese customers know that the country's best known beer
until the late 1980s was Tsingdao Beer from Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Foreign beer makers started to explore the Chinese market in
the early 1990s, and it took no more than six years for about 30
overseas beer brands to open-up China's market, including the
world's top 10 beer makers.
</P>
<P>
The first overseas beer brand to enter the China market was the
Philippines' San Miguel. The company leased the Guangzhou Beer
Plant and started producing San Miguel-brand beer, in order to get
access into Guangdong's market.
</P>
<P>
Around 50 joint ventures have been set up over the past few
years, involving 500 million US dollars in overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
In the northeastern part of China, top British brewer Bass has
invested 40 million pounds in a local brewing joint venture. The
company has strived to sell British-flavor beer to the generous
northeastern Chinese.
</P>
<P>
And in north China's port city Tianjin, Australian Fosters
purchased the Tianjin Bohai Brewing Company, and started exploring
the local market.
</P>
<P>
Up to now Chinese people have been quite familiar with most
world beer brands, such as Beckers, Budweiser, Bass and Fosters.
</P>
<P>
The American Miller's cooperation with the Five Stars Group in
Beijing is considered as one of the biggest joint ventures that
have been set up in China.
</P>
<P>
Miller invested 100 million US dollars in the venture, which
will raise its annual production capacity to 200,000 tons this
year. The venture is expected to control 20 percent of the
Capital's sales.
</P>
<P>
Another US brewing giant, Anheuser-Busch, is planning to
increase its investment in the Tsingdao Brewing Company to 200
million US dollars, in order to hold 20 percent of the Chinese
company's total shares.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Beers Raised Highly Into China Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After entering the China market, the next job for the foreign
brands is to encourage Chinese people to buy their products, and
drink them. What seems to be one of the keys to this thirst for
sales is advertising.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said foreign beer brands have fought an "Ads
War" against the Chinese breweries through TV, newspaper, and
radio promotions.
</P>
<P>
Most cash-starved Chinese breweries lost their upper-hand in
their monopolies of local markets in the beer stakes, and also
lost their brands, after having established joint ventures with
foreign investors, one industry source said.
</P>
<P>
However a spokesman for Australian Fosters, which has several
joint ventures in China, had to confess that his company will not
be able to make profits until the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign beer producers hope to elbow into the local market
first, where their ventures are sited, without learning what the
whole China market is really like.
</P>
<P>
And the China market is really too big for them, economic
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However not all Chinese will become potential customers of
foreign brand beers, after they find the beer's prices are three
times that of the domestically-made beers, a hotel manager said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign brands have pinned their hopes on the expanding of
the China market, expecting that their products might become the
favorite alcoholic beverages of the growing number of middle-class
Chinese.

<P>
Per capita beer consumption in China was just 12 liters last
year, just one eighth of that of the average American
drinker. Chinese people are expected to drink more than 30 million
tons of beer by the year of 2000, making China become the world's
biggest beer market -- and a liquid gold market for brewers.
</P>
<P>
This has brought to the top of agenda just how to develop and
protect China's national beer-making industry, while continuing
with the opening-up policy, an economist said.
</P>
<P>
China has about 860 brewery plants, but less than 60 plants
have an annual production capacity above 50,000 tons each. And
about 40 percent of the breweries could not make profits.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately some back-bone enterprises of China's brewing
industry have made substantial progress in strengthening their
positions in China's own market over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chinese brands have made successes in their own bids
to explore world markets.
</P>
<P>
Two big brewing companies have got themselves into shape,
namely, Tsingdao Beer Brewing Company, which controls 2.4 percent
of China's beer market, and the Zhujiang Brewing Company, which
plays a leading role in the south of China.
</P>
<P>
Yanjing Brewing Company, headquartered in Beijing, has also
become the country's biggest beer-maker, after it merged with
Huasi Brewing Group. The company has formed an annual capacity of
500,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
However only time can tell who will win in the fierce
competition in China's beer market. It might be the Chinese
customers, drinking as much as they can, who are the victors in
the battle for keeping the beer taps flowing in the world's second
biggest drinks market.

<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Blue skies over Weihai city, a
coastal city in east China's Shandong Province, has become one of
its boasts - thanks to an all-out attack on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The city's environmental department has ensured that
construction plans are mapped out to prevent the creation of new
pollution sources.
</P>
<P>
So far 57 boilers, fueled by coal, have been converted to burn
cleaner oil or liquified gas. Regular inspections are also carried
out of existing polluting sources.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1980s the city began to step up efforts to
improve urban heat supply facilities and promote cleaner
fuel. Over the past few years more than 70 million yuan has been
spent on building two thermal power plants and 42 centralised heat
supply stations. The environmental department has also spent two
million yuan building an automobile monitoring facility to check
vehicle exhaustion pollution.
</P>
<P>
The city's clean environment has helped draw investment from
both in and outside China. An electronic industry park funded by
the Ministry of Electronic Industry has taken shape. And a number
of foreign-funded enterprises in electronics, medicine, food,
biological engineering and fine chemicals, which require high air
quality, have also sprung up in the city.

<HEADLINE> Fire Erupts in US Treasury Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A fire broke out in the U.S.
Treasury Building Wednesday afternoon, forcing hundreds of
government workers to evacuate from the 19th building next to the
White House, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze erupted on the roof of the
125-year-old structure. Heavy smoke filled the fifth floor and
basement of the building.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not known. But the building was under
renovation and officials of the Treasury's secret service said it
appeared that some material they were using or the roof caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
The fire department evacuated hundreds of people from the
structure at about 4:30 p.m. and closed off surrounding streets to
traffic.
</P>
<P>
The building has mostly offices including the office of
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on the third floor.

<HEADLINE> Another Year of "Zero Population Growth" for Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 26 (Xinhua) -- With the number of deaths exceeding
that of births, Italy experienced the third year in a row of the
so-called "zero population growth" in 1995.
</P>
<P>
There were 526,064 births, compared with 555,203 deaths, in the
country in 1995, according to an annual population report released
by the government's Institute of Statistics today.
</P>
<P>
Only because of an influx of immigrants, Italy's population
increased 55,000 in the year to a total of 57,333,996.
</P>
<P>
Italy entered into "zero population growth" for the first time
in 1993, as it was turning increasingly into a country of
one-child families.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend in average family size, main due to
financial constraints, since has continued to keep Italy's birth
rate among the lowest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Britain's Constructive Stance on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
urged Britain to take a realistic and constructive position and
cooperate with China on the issue of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with El Pais, one of the most
influential newspapers in Spain, the Chinese president, who is
paying a state visit to Spain, said that all issues concerning
Hong Kong's transition period must be discussed and agreed between
the Chinese and British sides in line with the Sino-British Joint
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will return to China's sovereignty on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral action to make substantial changes of the
current political system in Hong Kong without an agreement between
the two sides runs counter to the joint declaration, the principle
of dovetailing with the Basic Law and related agreements and the
understandings reached between China and Britain," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"There is only a year left before China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, so I hope the British side will take a
realistic and constructive stance and strengthen cooperation with
the Chinese side," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government, after resuming the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong, will pursue the policies of "one
country, two systems", "Hong Kong ruled by Hong Kong people" and
"high-degree autonomy" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will strictly abide by the Basic Law and
guarantee law and order and long-term prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Madrid on Monday for a four-day state visit to
Spain. He will leave for Oslo, Norway, on Thursday to continue his
six-nation European and central Asian tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo today called on all nations to promote international
cooperation in combating drugs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the International Day of the War
Against Drugs, Zedillo said that the war against drugs should
begin in the consuming countries with firm international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the producing and consuming nations and those who
serve as transit points or money-laundering centers should take
their responsibility in the task.
</P>
<P>
"We Mexicans recognize that we are victims, never the
benefactors of the trafficking of illegal drugs," he said. The
best way to combat the drugs is to prevent it, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged every nation, community, family, school and every
citizen to assume that attitude.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo also signed an agreement for coordination between the
chambers of deputies and the senate and the federal
Attorney-General's Office in the prevention, control and combat of
drugs.

<HEADLINE>   Paraguayan President, General Responsible for Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy and retired General Lino Cesar Oviedo were jointly
responsible for the institutional crisis in April, a two-chamber
investigation committee (CBI) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report sent today to Judge Alcides Corbeta who is in
charge of investigating the cause of the crisis, the CBI said that
both the president and the former army chief General Oviedo
violated the national constitution by committing different crimes
that the justice authorities are investigating.
</P>
<P>
The CBI accused Oviedo of insubordination and sedition for
refusing President Wasmosy's order to have him relieved as army
chief and for attempting to stage a coup.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CBI investigation concluded that President
Wasmosy violated the constitution and laws through "actions or
omissions" as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and as the
person wielding executive power.
</P>
<P>
The committee stressed that Wasmosy announced General Oviedo's
refusal to obey orders on April 22 but did not order an immediate
disciplinary arrest of the military officer.
</P>
<P>
The CBI also criticized Wasmosy for offering the Defence
Ministry to Oviedo and described the President's embrace of the
military leader during a transfer of command ceremony in the army
as "inexplicable".
</P>
<P>
General Oviedo is now in prison under preventive detention for
alleged contempt and attempted sedition against the constitutional
order.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 social organizations continue to promote a campaign
asking for a political trial of President Wasmosy.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Coach Resignation a "joke" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Croatian
football federation Nadan Vidosevic said Wednesday in Zagreb that
the resignation of national coach Miroslav Blazevic announced
Monday was just a "joke".
</P>
<P>
Vidosevid explained that was due to the reception the coach
received on his return from England. "It was not official," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When Blazevic arrived back at Zagreb airport after Sunday's 2-1
defeat by Germany, he was greeted by some 2,000 whistling fans
who vented their anger at his decision to rest several stars
prior to a group defeat by Portugal.
</P>
<P>
That result meant that the Croats as group runners-up had to
face Germany in their quarter-final rather than the relative
"minnow" Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> State Circular Demands Tax Rebates to Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Taxation has issued an emergent circular telling tax departments
nationwide that they should get tax rebates to exporters
efficiently and with speed.
</P>
<P>
"While enhancing the collection of taxes and improving the
management of tax rebates for exports, the payment of tax rebates
set by state standards should be accelerated," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that delivery of tax rebates has slowed down
since the start of this year. The amount of tax rebates during the
first four months was 15.63 billion yuan (about 1.8 billion US
dollars), down 42 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Exporters of machinery, electronics products, and silk and
those who have never cheated on their taxes should have priority
in getting tax rebates, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that payment of tax rebates should also be tilted in
favor of credit-worthy exporting enterprises, especially large
ones.

NANJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou, an economic powerhouse in
east China's Jiangsu Province, has put a local regulation on
economic development zones into effect to provide standardization.
</P>
<P>
The city is now home to five state-level development zones and,
by the end of 1995, there were already ten province-level
development zones there; they covered an area of 81.24 sq km and
involved 2.2 billion yuan in investment in basic construction; 566
enterprises have gone into operation in the development zones and
have provided 640 million yuan in profits and taxes.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is aimed at solving problems that have cropped
up in developing the zones, such as management and organization,
overall planning, and collecting and managing development funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the overall planning of the
development zones must be included in the region's overall
economic and social development program, and state-controlled
professional fund management will be set up in the zones.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is expected to accelerate the construction of
development zones, experts say.

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. men's Olympic gymnastics
coaches have high expectations about the selected team at the
trials beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the 1995 World Championships in Japan, the U.S. men
plummeted from third place after the compulsories to ninth after
the optionals, nearly failing to qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coaches promised the Olympic squad will be more
consistent and choose routines with difficulty equal to that of
any team in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"You can't go in there with 9.6, 9.7 start values and expect
to beat teams with 9.8., 9.9 start values," said U.S. men's
Olympic coach Peter Korman.
</P>
<P>
Leading contenders for the U.S. Olympic squad include reigning
national champion Blaine Wilson and four-time national champion
John Roethlisberger, who finished second to Wilson this year.
</P>
<P>
Seven athletes will make the Olympic squad, chosen by a
combination of all-around scores at nationals and trials. The
national championships score counts 40 percent, while trials
count for for 60 percent in the selection process.
</P>
<P>
Korman considered the Chinese were pretty strong while the
Russians might be slightly favoured for second. "After that,
everybody is practically even."

But, said Milovanovich, the question of defense must not be

BUENOS AIRES, June 26 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Salaries Drop
</P>
<P>
Argentines were paid an average monthly salary of 854.2 pesos
(about the same amount of U.S. dollars) in March, down 1.7 percent
over last year, the Economy Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Salaries have been shrinking since the beginning of the year,
averaging 931 pesos in January and dropping to 874 pesos in
February.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Output Goes Up
</P>
<P>
The industrial output for May gained by 5.4 percent compared
with April and by 1.7 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
But the Latin American Economic Research Foundation said the
increase was due solely to the fact that the month had more
working days.
</P>
<P>
Bank Deposits Reach Nearly 50 Billion Dollars
</P>
<P>
Deposits in Argentina's banks rose to 49.511 billion pesos in
May, up 10 percent over the end of 1994, when the Mexican
financial crisis swept Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the total deposits, 52 percent correspond to foreign
currency deposits and the remainder to peso deposits, said
"Adeba," a financial body which groups the national capital banks
except Citibank.
</P>
<P>
First Quarter Investments Drop
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic investment dropped by 14 percent in the first
quarter of this year compared with the same period of last year,
the Economy Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The most serious investment decreases were observed in the
automobile industry with 23.6 percent, transportation equipment
industry with 17.9 percent, construction industry with 17
percent and machinery with 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop in investments, implying inactive economic activities,
responded to a 3.2 percent decrease in the gross domestic
product.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives in Lyon for G-7 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived
in the southeastern French city of Lyon today for a summit of the
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations, which is to open
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reportedly said before leaving the White House that the
fight against terrorism has become the "first order of our
business."
</P>
<P>
A fuel truck bomb attack Tuesday on a military housing complex
in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, claimed at least 19 lives of the
U.S. servicemen stationed there.
</P>
<P>
"Our first order of business will be to focus the strength and
the energy of the G-7 on the continuing fight against terrorism,"
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Defeating these organized forces of destruction is one of the
most important challenges our country faces at the end of this
century and at the beginning of the next," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism, which has already been on the agenda of the
three-day summit, is expected to be given more attention as other
leaders of the seven countries echoed Clinton's remarks.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major described Tuesday's bomb
attack as "an appalling act, an act of pure evil, for no reason."
</P>
<P>
He also referred to a bomb explosion in downtown Manchester on
June 15, saying that "we have had all too much of this sort of
experience, this unprovoked bomb, the murder of innocent people."
</P>
<P>
Britain has been a target of bomb attacks of the Irish
Republican Army, the military wing of the breakaway Sinn Fein
Party of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
France, who had been victim of terrorist attacks of Algerian
Islamic militants, said in a Foreign Ministry statement that
"terrorism should be fought without fail, on matter where it comes
and who its authors may be."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said: "Terrorism
cannot be justified for any reason."
</P>
<P>
Germany also showed solidarity with the U.S. in the attack and
expressed condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The summit was expected to put forward 40 recommendations on
the fight against organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The weight of the summit, however, was lessened by the absence
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who decided not to turn up so
as to gather strength for a runoff with communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 was made up of the United States, Britain, France,
Canada, Germany, Japan and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Seles Knocked out of Wimbledon Tennis Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 26 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The world joint
number one tennis player Monica Seles of the United States was
defeated by unseeded Slovak player Katarina Studenikova in the
second round of the on-going 1996 Wimbledon Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who has won every Grand Slam title but Wimbledon,
produced an uncharacterically error-ridden game and was finally
knocked out of the Championships by 5-7, 7-5, 4-6.
</P>
<P>
It was the earliest ever defeat in a Grand Slam event for the
talented young tennic super-star, who had missed the last three
Wimbledon Championships after being injured by a spectator in
Hamburg in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Seles, the second seed in the Championships, was not in her
aggressive form and was really at a loss against her Slovak
opponent, who ranked 59th in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I am not too happy with the way I am playing but I still just
have to reassess. She played smarter than I did today," Seles said
after the match.
</P>
<P>
The women's fourth seed Arantza Sanchez Vicario and fifth
seeded Anke Huber trashed their opponents in straight sets and
entered the next round of the Wimbledon women's singles events.
</P>
<P>
In the man's singles clashes today, second seeded German
tennis ace Boris Becker survived an early scare before easing to
victory over Spanish player Thomas Carbonnel in the second round
of the fortnight Championships.
</P>
<P>
Becker, who looked to be going to be another upset after
losing the first set, pulled himself together and fought back to
win 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The German player said after the game that "I really have to
play my best tennis in the second set in order to get back into
the match"
</P>
<P>
"I have to really take control at the beginning of the
match. I can not give away a set like I did today. In the next
round, I have to start better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nine seed Thmoas Enqvist of Sweden joined the lower-half
casualties when he lost to American Malivai Washington in straight
sets, 4-6, 6-7, 3-6.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Centre Court program begins with an eagerly
awaited rematch between defending Champion Pete Sampras and Mark
Phipippinssis, the man who beat him in the Australian Open earlier
this year.

<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua/OANA) -- European soccer giant Germany
and unfancied Czech Republic defeated their strong opponents
England and France by the same score 6-5 in two thrilling
semi-final shoot-outs today and they will compete for the European
Soccer Championships honour on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Host team England, which in shocking prime form since the
beginnig of the tournament, started today's game brilliantly with
the two-minute goal from top striker Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
The German side, which had to fight without its super-star
Klingsmann, tried hard to resist the waves of fierce attacks from
the England side and hit a great equalizer by Stefan Kuntz at the
15th minute.
</P>
<P>
Under the deafening cheering roars of thousands of home fans,
confident England players nealy dominnated all the stages of the
game, but failed to get another goal.
</P>
<P>
At the extra-time play, both sides displayed inspiring
attacking football and got some golden chances to get a so-called
"golden goal", but the 30-minute play still ended with 1-1.
</P>
<P>
In the thrilling shoot-outs, Gareth Southgate, the bright young
England player, was the unlucky man as he stepped up with the
shoot-out locked at 5-5 after some brilliant spot-kicks.
</P>
<P>
In another semi-final clash between favourite France and
so-called out-sider Czech Republic played in Manchester city, the
Czech team, which defeated favourite Italy and Portugal earlier in
this Championships, produced another big surprise by ousting the
current hottest candidate to win the Euro soccer title.
</P>
<P>
French team, full of well-known soccer stars, failed to
displayed their excellent team work and was at some time of the
game playing above their normal level.
</P>
<P>
In the identical shoot-out after 0-0 draw, French player Pedros
saw his spot-kick saved by Czech goalkeeper, sending the
star-studded French team crashing out of the Championships.
</P>
<P>
The lucky German and Czech teams, removing their last hurdles,
are heading for European Soccer Championships final to be played

GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Passenger traffic at airports
worldwide grew by a healthy 8 percent in the first quarter of 1996
over the same period last year, according to the latest figures.

The report, based on data from 460 airports worldwide, shows

percent, followed by a 9 percent increase in Europe.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Hegemonism, Power Politics: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reiterated here today that China will never seek hegemonism and
will never become a superpower.
</P>
<P>
"We resolutely oppose hegemonism and power politics in any
form," Jiang said during an interview with the Spanish newspaper
El Pais (The Country).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here Monday on a four-day state
visit to Spain at the invitation of King Juan Carlos I.
</P>
<P>
In the interview today, Jiang said that even if China's
comprehensive national strength becomes much stronger in the
future, it will adhere unremittingly to the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"We will make efforts, on the basis of these principles, to
maintain and develop friendly and cooperative relations with other
countries, including the U.S., Russia and Japan," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea,
Jiang said that China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha
islands and nearby water areas.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the 1970s that some littoral countries began
to make territorial claims over the Nansha islands, Jiang pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that disputes can be settled through peaceful
negotiations, and if conditions for talks are not ready, we can
shelve disputes and carry out joint development," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of China and countries concerned in
recent years, the situations in the South China Sea have been
comparatively stable and there is no such problem as dangerous
situations.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the first leg of Jiang's six European and central
Asian nation tour, which will also take him to Norway, Romania,
Uzbekistan, Kyrghyzstan and Kazakhstan.

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today promised federal help to prevent church arsons at a White
House prayer breakfast he hosted for religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will make available to
churches arson prevention workshops and other resources to help
them stem the recent rash of fires aimed mostly at predominantly
black churches, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, before departing on a scheduled trip to France for the
G-7 summit, also met at the White House with a group of leaders of
major national fire and emergency services organizations.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 religious leaders from various denominations were
present at the prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 suspicious fires have struck churches, mostly with
predominantly black congregations in the South, over the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
As part of the FEMA's response outlined today to the church
leaders, the agency has provided 773,000 dollars to the affected
states for arson training programs, will distribute radio and
television advertisements describing arson prevention tips, and
has established a toll-free number as a central clearing house for
information on arson prevention.

<HEADLINE> IFOR to Play Supporting Role in Mostar Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSTAR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Implementation Force
(IFOR) will only play a supporting role in securing the upcoming
Mostar elections, an IFOR commander said today.
</P>
<P>
"There must be no misunderstanding: the ballot of June 30 is
neither organized nor controlled by the (IFOR) military," General
Xavier de Lambert, commander of the IFOR division in southeastern
Bosnia, told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is definitely the role of the local police to
ensure that all voters can freely vote" under the supervision of
the UN international police and the European Union Administration
in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
The EU has organized the municipal elections in Mostar with the
aim of unifying the ethnically divided city.
</P>
<P>
Muslims and Croats fought fiercely in Mostar in the 1993-94
period and each has since taken over roughly half of the city.
According the rules of elections, many people have to cross into
the territory of the former enemies to cast their votes, giving
rise to concerns that violence might flare up on the election day.
</P>
<P>
Lambert said the IFOR will gather around 2,500 troops in Mostar
on the election day as a backup for the UN and EU police, but
"this force would only intervene upon request from Mr. Perez
Casado," who is the EU Mostar administrator.
</P>
<P>
The French general said that the IFOR in Mostar will be "a
visible presence that will not however turn the city into a
fortified camp."

<HEADLINE> Environmental Damage Mounting in Every Sphere: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The failure of solidarity, vision
and responsibility causes environmental damage to mount in every
sphere of the world.
</P>
<P>
The world faces a linked crisis of the environment, quality of
life and population, according to a report released here today by
the Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life.
</P>
<P>
The global population is currently adding 88 million every
year, and environmental damage is mounting in every sphere, the
report warned.
</P>
<P>
In the developed countries, they face unemployment, economic
insecurity, family breakdown, rising crime, and the crisis of the
welfare state, it said.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, despite its rapid economic growth, poverty is proving
stubbornly persistent almost everywhere. One to two billion people
are still denied their most basic rights to a basic, acceptable
quality of life. Some 800 million are malnourished, 1,300 million
have no access to clean water, 900 million adults are illiterate
and more than 400 million children are denied education, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that internationally, programs to eradicate
poverty or to combat environmental problems lack adequate funding,
while national policies give priority to economic targets
disregarding quality of life.
</P>
<P>
If the above mentioned trend is not quickly reversed, the
report foresaw such a world picture: the planet is heading by the
middle of the next century for a population of perhaps 11 billion
with environmental problems at crisis level, and poverty and
social division rampant.
</P>
<P>
The commission presented a challenging set of concrete
proposals for a radical shift of direction:
</P>
<P>
-- Placing sustainable quality of policymaking;
</P>
<P>
-- Accelerating progress towards stabilizing the world's
population by massive efforts in health, education and the use of
development assistance;
</P>
<P>
-- Raising poor, marginal and excluded groups to a minimum
standard within two decades;
</P>
<P>
-- Establishing new patterns of production and consumption, and
encouraging new lifestyles in the context of a globalized economy
and rapid technological progress;
</P>
<P>
-- Fostering a new sense of mutual responsibility, guided by
care; and
</P>
<P>
-- Changing present patterns of governance, nationally and
internationally, so as to overcome deadlocks in the international
order.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life,
which was set up in 1993, consists of seven Western governments,
three international agencies (the UN Population Fund, the
International Planned Parenthood Federation, and the World Bank),
and five major private foundations (Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur,
Hewlett and Mellon).

<HEADLINE> The West Criticized for Imposing Reforms on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Kenya
Chen Pengchu today criticized the western countries to force
developing countries to implement unrealistic economic and
political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chem Pengchu said developing countries should be given time to
adopt new and realistic measures.
</P>
<P>
Chen Pingchu, who is on a working tour to Nyanza Province,
western Kenya, was conferring with Nyanza Provincial
Commissioner (PC) Joseph Kaguthi in Kisumu today.
</P>
<P>
He said China has defied pressure from the west and is
committed to undertaking reforms at its own pace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ambassador expressed concern with the widening
gap of trade between the countries, saying that China's exports
to Kenya last year totaled 76.4 million Pounds Sterling as
compared with Kenya's exports to China valued at 2.12 million
Pounds Sterling only.
</P>
<P>
In reply, the PC said lack of flow of trade information was
the main hindrance to improving the trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for its role in developing rural areas of
Kenya and said that the two countries have a lot to learn from
each other since they both faced similar challenges.

<HEADLINE> Looted Goods on Sale in Monrovia Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Selling of looted goods has become
widespread in Liberia's devastated capital, Monrovia, even as
normalcy returns to the city following the recent factional
fighting and looting.
</P>
<P>
An investigative report reaching here today said computers,
television and radio sets, eletronic gadgets and parts of
cannibalised vehicles are on sale in the markets, a scene that
was never seen in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Bags, medicines and others, looted from the United Nations
agencies in the city, are also being peddled in the streets.
</P>
<P>
One of the Liberian carpet traders was quoted by the report as
saying that he got his supplies from ''some of the fighters."
</P>
<P>
The goods were being sold cheaply with a fairly new color
20-inch tv set going for 100 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another said he together with many other traders, preferred to
sell to members of the African peacekeeping forces, the ECOMOG,
because ''they have U.S. dollars to buy''.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior army officer from Nigeria, who is currently
serving with the ECOMOG, denied that most of the goods were being
bought by the peacekeeping soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He said that traders from other west African countries had not
stopped travelling to Monrovia in spite of the war.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the street fighting, which started on
April 6, had left Monrovia devastated with many houses,
government offices and other structures completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
While some of the buildings were damaged by rockets, others
were wilfully burnt down after everything in them had been looted
by fighters belonging to the various warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in the Liberian capital once again among
the warring factions in April after the dismissal of ULIMO-J
leader Roosevelt Johnson from the government and attempts to
arrest him on murder charges.
